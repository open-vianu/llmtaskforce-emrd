You are a medical expert. Please find whether the medicine is a priority medicine (PRIME). From the following text, there are two conditions under which a medicine can be classified as a PRIME medicine:

1. If the document contains a header which contains the word 'prime'
or
2. If the document contains the word 'prime' in the section titled 'Submission of the dossier'
or
3. If the medicine has been granted 'prime' status or is eligible as a 'prime' medicine in any of the sections, then classify it as a PRIME medicine

If the above headers do not exist or the medicine has been authorized before 2016-03-01 then the output should be "Value not reported (available for medicines authorised from 2016-03-01 onwards)". If the medicine has been authorized after 2016-03-01, the output should only be "True" if it is a PRIME medicine and "False" if it is not. 

Do not add additional information or assessment. The output should be "True", "False" or "Value not reported (available for medicines authorised from 2016-03-01 onwards)".
