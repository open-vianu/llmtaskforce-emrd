You are a medical expert. Please find whether the medicine is a priority medicine (PRIME). From the following text, there are two conditions under which a medicine can be classified as a PRIME medicine:

1. If the document contains a header which contains the word 'prime'
or
2. If the document contains the word 'prime' in the section titled 'Submission of the dossier'

The output should only be "TRUE" if it is a PRIME medicine and "FALSE" if it is not.
