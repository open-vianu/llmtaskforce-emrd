***General information***

The chemical name of dasitinib is N-(2-Chloro-6-methylphenyl)-2-[[6-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1
piperazinyl]-2-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl]amino]-5-thiazole carboxamide corresponding to the molecular

formula C 22 H 26 CIN 7 O 2 S. It has a relative molecular weight of 488.02 g/mol and the following structure:

**Figure:** Active substance structure

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 9/29


-----

The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of NMR spectrum,

mass spectrum, infrared spectrum, UV spectrum and elemental analysis.

The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic white to off-white fine crystalline powder which exhibits

pH dependent aqueous solubility *.* According to FDA BCS guideline, dasitinib is considered a low solubility

active substance.

Optical isomerism is not possible because there is no chiral carbon in the active substance molecule.

Dasatinib is known to exist in few anhydrous and numerous solvated crystalline forms and in an

amorphous form, based on literature survey and extensive polymorphism screening studies. Desired

anhydrous dasatinib form is consistently obtained by the proposed manufacturing process of the active

substance. All the other known anhydrous forms and solvates are not likely to be formed in the last

crystallisation step and in the solvent system used or by storage of the active substance, hence, they

cannot be present as impurities in the produced desired polymorphic form.

***Manufacture, characterisation and process controls***

An Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure was used to provide information on the active

substance. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the

restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

Dasitinib is synthesised in 2 main stages using commercially available well-defined starting materials
with acceptable specifications.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods

for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline

on chemistry of new active substances.

Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The active substance is packaged in double PE bags with antistatic additive as primary packing, placed

in multilayer PET/Al/PET/LDPE bag and introduced into cardboard drum. which complies with the EC

directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

***Specification***

The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (IR, HPLC,

XRD), assay (HPLC), water (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (GC, HPLC),

residual solvents (GC, HPLC), and particle size (laser diffraction).
##### The specification for dasatinib has been established based on the guidelines of ICH Q3A, ICH Q3C, ICH Q3D and ICH Q6A. Dasatinib is not listed in any of the official Pharmacopoeias. The limits on related substances are based on analyses of so far manufactured batches of the active substance and the ICH guideline Q3A and are considered satisfactory.

According to the ICH Guideline Q3C residual solvents are class 2 and class 3 solvents in compliance

with the ICH Guideline Q3C. Limits for these solvents are in line with the guideline and also tightened

according to actual results.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods)

appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the

reference standards used has been presented.

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 10/29


-----

Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are

within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

***Stability***

Stability data from 4 pilot-scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in

the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 `±` 3⁰C) and for up

to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25 `±` 2⁰C / 60 `±` 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines

were provided.

The following parameters were tested *:* appearance, identification, crystal form, water, assay, and

related substances. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability

indicating.

The results so far of long term and accelerated stability studies fully meet the stability specification and

no changes have been observed in the quality of the active substance. The results fully support a

retest period.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is

sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months without storage

conditions in the proposed container.
##### **2.2.3. Finished medicinal product **

***Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development***

The finished product is presented in film-coated tablets containing 20, 50, 70, 80, 100, and 140 mg of

dasitinib. The tablets are presented below:

20 mg: White to off-white, round, 5.6 mm of diameter, coated tablets debossed on one side with

"DAS" and "20" on the other side.

50 mg: W hite to off-white, oval, 5.7 x 10.6 mm, coated tablets debossed on one side with "DAS" and

"50" on the other side.

70 mg: W hite to off-white, round, 8.7 mm of diameter, coated tablets debossed on one side with

"DAS" and "70" on the other side.

80 mg: W hite to off-white, triangle-shaped, 9.9 x 10.2 mm, coated tablets debossed on one side with

"DAS" and "80" on the other side.

100 mg: W hite to off-white, oval, 7.1 x 14.5 mm, coated tablets debossed on one side with "DAS" and

"100" on the other side.

140 mg: W hite to off-white, round, 11 mm of diameter, coated tablets debossed on one side with

"DAS" and "140" on the other side.

The aim of the finished product development was to develop a generic dosage form of the reference

medicinal product Sprycel tablet 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg and 140 mg.

Initially, the quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined based on the properties of the active

substance, characterisation of the reference medicinal product, and consideration of the reference

product label. Identification of critical quality attributes (CQAs) was based on the impact to patient

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 11/29


-----

safety and efficacy resulting from failure to meet that quality attributes of the finished product.

Pharmaceutical development focused on those CQAs that could be impacted by a realistic change to

the finished product formulation or manufacturing process. For the generic medicinal product, these

CQAs included assay, uniformity of dosage units, residual solvent content, dissolution, and

degradation. A quality by design (QbD) approach was used to define the formulation and

manufacturing process and to provide acceptable quality attributes of the generic.However, no design

spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.

Reported literature indicates that dasatinib is a poorly soluble, highly permeable Biopharmaceutics

Classification System (BCS) Class II compound. The reference medicinal product contains dasatinib

monohydrate, whereas dasatinib anhydrous has been used for the development of the generic

medicinal product. The data demonstrated that both forms of dasatinib (anhydrous and monohydrate)

have highest solubility at pH conditions of 4.0 and below. However, in media at pH 3.0-4.0, the

anhydrous form was shown to be several times more soluble than the monohydrate form.

These solubility differences lead to different *in vitro* release profiles from that of the reference

medicinal product. The formulation has been developed to meet the bio-equivalence criteria. Dasatinib

desired polymorphic form samples were exposed to different stress conditions and X-ray powder

diffraction was performed. Preliminary stress testing was carried out on dasatinib anhydrous to study

its chemical stability, impurity profile and degradation pathway and to facilitate the development of a

stability-indicating method. Stressed samples were compared to the unstressed sample. The data

showed that dasatinib anhydrous is labile to UV exposure and oxidative stress treatments, but stable

under acidic, alkaline, and thermal (both in absence and in presence of high humidity) stresses. XRD

data of studies on polymorphic stability under stressed conditions showed that dasatinib desired

polymorphic form is stable under thermal, humidity, pressure and grinding stress conditions. The

dasatinib desired polymorphic form is also retained after preparing the slurry with water but is

converted to IPA (isopropyl alcohol) solvate after preparing the slurry with IPA.

The excipients used in the proposed generic product were selected based on those used in the

reference medicinal product, the formulation development strategy and excipient compatibility studies.

Most excipients and the quantities used are common in the manufacture of this type of dosage form

and are considered safe in the proposed concentrations. Binary mixtures of excipients and active

substance at different ratios were stored under accelerated conditions in HDPE bottles for three months

and analysed. All results were within specifications; it was therefore concluded that the proposed

excipients are compatible with the active sustance. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical

ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards exept the coating solution which

complies with In house specifications. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product

formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this

report.

During initial stages of development, a formulation using similar excipients and manufacturing process

as those of the reference product was evaluated. However, developed formulation showed that the

drug release was comparable as that of the reference product. The *in vitro* dissolution method

developed and validated is the QC method that is able to discriminate between good batches and reject

the bad ones. Th *e in vivo* comparative bioavailability study conducted between the reference medicinal

product Sprycel 140 mg and the proposed generic medicinal product has been shown to be comparable

(C max and AUC data). The T max of the generic medicinal product is also relatively short at 0.75h.

A major objection (MO) was raised because of a discrepancy in dissolution profiles observed at pH 3

with two different batches. The applicant has clarified that the discrepancy in the dissolution profiles at

pH 3 resulted from a batch which had a different composition, particularly with respect to binders (with

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 12/29


-----

higher amounts of Eudragit), to batches which have the composition proposed for marketing. The MO

was considered resolved.

The commercial manufacturing process of the finished product consists in premixing, granulation,

drying, milling, blending, lubrication, compression, and coating. Several batches from different blends

of the submission and validation batches were analysed and the percentage of each form of active

substance in the finished product was determined based on the XRD patterns of the pure active

substance. The results of these batches were compared with that of the bio batch. Polymorphic form

proportions (tested by XRD) were included in both release and shelf life specifications.

As major objection (MO) on dissolution limit and discriminatory power was raised, the applicant

proposed dissolution specifications (NLT 75% in 45 mins), it could be observed that the dissolution of

the batch made with active substance with particles larger than the limits for PSD, would fail the

dissolution test. The batch made with finer active substance, despite the increased surface area does

not result in significantly faster dissolution. In both cases (made with finer and larger particles), the

dissolution profiles fail similarity comparison with the bio batch. Thus, with limits in place for the active

substance PSD and dissolution, the finished product performance can be ensured. The MO was

considered to be resolved.

Comparative bioavailability studies under fasting conditions was performed to assess the

bioequivalence of formulation of pivotal batch after a single oral dose administration. In the pivotal

bioequivalence study, the comparison was made between the proposed generic medicinal product and

the EU reference medicinal product. The results presented showed that the criteria used to assess

bioequivalence between the generic and reference formulations were fulfilled. The Test to Reference

ratio of geometric LS means and corresponding 90% confidence interval for Cmax, AUC0-T and AUC0
∞ were all within the acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%.

A biowaiver for 20, 50, 70, 80, and 100 mg strengths was applied by the applicant. In support to this

request, the applicant stated that all strengths are dose proportional; however this was not considered

to be sufficient justification on its own. In order to demonstrate similarity between the bio batch and all

the remaining strengths, comparison of dissolution profiles of the highest strength of the bio batch to

the dissolution profiles of all the remaining strengths (without surfactant) at pHs 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 was

provided and considered satisfactory.

No data was provided on the proportions of polymorphic forms in the batches used for the request of

biowaiver, therefore, it could not be confirmed that all batches of all strengths to be manufactured

routinely will have the same proportions of polymorphic forms as the biobatch. This precluded the

granting of the biowaiver. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the biowaiver may only be granted if a

limit for both anhydrous and solvate polymorphic form proportions is included in the release and shelf

life specification of all strengths. The applicant agreed to include a limit for both anhydrous and solvate

polymorphic form proportions in the release and shelf life specification of all strengths and the issue

was considered solved.

A risk assessment of the overall finished product manufacturing process was performed to identify the

high-risk steps that may affect the CQAs of the finished product. Subsequently, the CQAs of

intermediates from each process step that impact the finished product CQAs were identified.

For each process step, a risk assessment was conducted to identify potentially high-risk process

variables which could impact the identified intermediate CQAs and, ultimately, the finished product

CQAs. These variables were then investigated to better understand the manufacturing process and to

develop a control strategy to reduce the risk of a failed batch.

Several trials were made with active substance having different particle size distribution (PSD) values

to evaluate the effects of particle size on assay and content uniformity of the finished product. Based

-----

on the results, there was no significant difference observed among the batch manufactured with

different PSDs of active substance. All results met the specifications. The PSD specification was

determined based on the range evaluated during process validation.

Effects of the binders, disintegrant, lubricant, and coating level were studied. As a result of these

studies, the commercial formulation of the finished product was selected.

The primary packaging is Alu/Alu blisters (blisters or perforated unit dose blisters). The material

complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been

validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

***Manufacture of the product and process controls***
##### The manufacturing process consists of 10 main steps: weighing, sieving, mixing, wet granulation, drying, blending, lubrication, compression, film‐coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a

standard manufacturing process.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies in tablets blend

and tablets 20, 50, 70, 80, 100 and 140 mg. The validation was performed on six commercial scale

batches of dasatinib tablets blend. The two extremes of tablet strength (20 & 140 mg) were validated

with 3 commercial scale batches each. The 100 mg strength was also validated with 3 batches. The

validation was performed on one batch for the intermediate strengths: 50, 70 and 80 mg. It has been

demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended

quality in a reproducible manner, however the CHMP recommended to carry out the leak test for

packaging integrity and visual checks during commercial phase full scale packaging validation and

submit the data via a variation. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form.

***Product specification***

The finished product specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form description

(visual), identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage unit (HPLC), dissolution (UPLC), degradation products (HPLC), residual solvents ( GC-HS), water (Ph. Eur.), disintegration (Ph. Eur.), polymorphic forms (XRD), and microbial limit tests (Ph. Eur). The specifications are the same for all strengths, except the description which include “20”, “50”, “70”, “80”, “100”, and “140” mg depending on the

strength.

In the context of reflection paper on the dissolution specification for generic solid oral immediate

release products with systemic action (Decision tree for the principles for setting specifications based

on the dissolution results of the bio batch), immediate release is identified as at least 75% (Q) of the

active substance is dissolved within 45 minutes. The Q derives from the Ph. Eur. (5.17.1)

recommendation for conventional release dosage forms. Therefore, in line with the reflection paper,

the applicant was asked as major objection to set a single dissolution specification of NLT 75% in 45

minutes or else set a specification for more than one time point. The finished product specifications

limit was amended as requested.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3

batches using a validated ICP-OES method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental

impurity does not exceed their PDE, nor their control thresholds. Based on the risk assessment, it can

be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls.

A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been

requested as major objection considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the

Assessment report

“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the

Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal

products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation

EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based

on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of

nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional

control measures are deemed necessary.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in

accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used

has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 12 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the

manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through

traditional final product release testing.

***Stability of the product***

Stability data from 12 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under

long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75%

RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to

those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.
##### Samples were tested for description, assay, dissolution, degradation products, water, disintegration, polymorphic forms and microbial limit. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.

A reduced design has been considered in line with the ICH Q1D guideline. As defined on ICH

guidelines, topic Q1D: “bracketing is the design of a stability schedule such that only samples on the

extremes of certain design factors (e.g., strength, container size and/or fill) are tested at all time

points as in a full design”. A reduced design of stability study, more precisely, bracketing was chosen,

seen that the formulation of all the strengths is identical and materials of the container closure system

are the same for all the strengths. The selected approach, regarding the exhibit batches, is to follow in

stability three batches of each extreme strength and one batch of each intermediate strength.

‐
The long term stability studies conducted on the finished product demonstrate that the all parameters
meet the specifications with the exception of dissolution, for a period of 24 months for all batches
under stability. Results also conform after 6 months under accelerated stability conditions in the
proposed container closure system for all batches that are part of the stability program.

Before a shelf life (and associated storage conditions) and a hold time was granted, the applicant was

asked, as major objection, to address all the observations related to the intra- and inter-batch

variability in dissolution results of stability batches and provide more long-term stability data. The

applicant did not provide data of the original stability batches at 36 months but restarted stability

studies afresh. The applicant was reminded that new time points should be tested at a specification of

NLT 75% (Q) at 45 minutes and stability studies should include tests for proportions of the

polymorphic forms in the finished product. In line with the CHMP comments, the dissolution limit in the

shelf life specifications was tightened by the applicant to NLT 75% (Q) in 45 minutes and additional

data was generated on new batches. Twelve validation batches were, stored in bulk, packaged in

blisters and then followed in long-term and accelerated conditions. All dissolution results performed on

the validation batches meet the revised dissolution limit NLT 75% (Q) at 45 minutes for a period of 6

months. All these batches were stored in bulk for 9 months before being packaged in blisters. All the

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 15/29


-----

stability results from the new batches met the new established dissolution limits NLT 75% (Q) at 45

minutes. Given that, for the stability studies of the validation batches, the applicant only provided

dissolution values, the results of the previously submitted batches are being taken into consideration

to inform on the other stability parameters and grant the shelf life. No concerns remained outstanding

following the assessment of the other stability parameters during previous rounds of this procedure.

Since there is currently 6 months’ real time stability data available, the shelf life granted in line with

ICH Q1E is 12 months. Polymorphic form proportions have not been evaluated in stability studies so

far but, due to the inclusion of limits for such proportions in both the release and shelf-life

specifications these are to be included in stability studies from this point onwards.

Forced degradation study was carried out on the finished product in solution and power, the effects of

acid, alkaline, ultraviolet irradiation, thermal and oxidation stresses on the finished product were

studied and the resulting degradation products were monitored. The forced degradation study of the

finished product in solution has shown that finished product is sensitive to all stress treatments, forced

degradation evaluation on powder samples has shown relatively good stability showing a slight

degradation of the finished product.

In addition, five batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing

of New Drug Substances and Products. It has been concluded that the finished product is not sensitive

to light.

A bulk stability study was performed to propose a bulk holding time period for the bulk tablets. The

bulk tablets are packed in the designated packaging material for bulk storage. The batches are stored

under ICH controlled conditions 25°C ± 2°C, 60 % RH ± 5% for 9 months. The testing is performed

initially, at 3 months, 6 months and 9 months. The results between the bulk tablets and the packaged

batches of identical stations do not show significant differences. Another bulk stability study was

conducted where the dissolution specification was NLT 75% (Q) in 45 minutes; tablets were tested

initially and after 9 months and the dissolution specification was met. It is therefore possible to

conclude that the product can be kept in bulk tablets for a period of 9 months before being packaged in

the proposed container closure system.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months without any special storage

conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

***Adventitious agents***

It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as

those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the

use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the

Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal

products.
##### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects **

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has

been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that

the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

A number of issues were raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO). The MOs were related to

formulation, dissolution of the finished product, presence of polymorphic forms of the active substance

Assessment report
EMA/116969/2022 Page 16/29


-----

in the finished product, the strength biowaivers, primary packaging material, dissolution specifications

of the finished product, risk evaluation of nitrosamines and stability of the finished product. The issues

were resolved satisfactorily by the applicant as described above.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the

Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertains to carry out the leak test and visual checks during

commercial phase full scale packaging validation and submit the data via a variation. This point is put

forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development.
##### **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has

been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. **2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development **

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,

the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

- to carry out the leak test and visual checks during commercial phase full scale packaging validation

and submit the data via a variation. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided,

which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no

need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The

non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity

profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. **2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the

introduction of Dasatinib Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to

result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all dasatinib containing products

and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. **2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

The applicant has used isopropyl alcohol to "enhance" the solubility of the dasatinib (presenting better

dissolution profile). This was to be removed during the manufacturing process. However the applicant

was asked to discuss the possible formation of a solvate with isopropanol and the possible impact in

terms of safety. The applicant responded that the proposed release specification for isopropanol

ensures that the total daily exposure to isopropanol from Dasatinib Accord tablets will be below the

established PDE of 50 mg/day (Impurities: Guideline for residual solvents Q3C (R6). ICH. 20 October

2016), thereby representing a safe exposure level when used according to the recommended posology

of the drug product. The applicant’s position is considered justified and thus acceptable.
##### **2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

There are no objections to approval of Dasatinib Accord from a non-clinical point of view. The non
clinical parts of the SmPC of the generic product are identical to those of the reference product. ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction **

This is an application for film-coated tablets containing dasatinib. To support the marketing

authorisation application the applicant conducted 1 bioequivalence study with cross-over design under

fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for this application.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as

well as efficacy and safety of dasatinib based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the

SmPC of the reference product.

No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.

For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence

CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation

(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) in their current version and Dasatinib product-specific bioequivalence

guidance (EMA/CHMP/675838/2014) version 1 in its current version (Rev1/2020), are of particular

relevance.

***GCP aspect***

The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

***Exemption***

The applicant has submitted one fasting bioequivalence (BE) study in support of this application, and

this was performed using the highest strength (140mg film coated) claiming an exemption for the

lower strengths. To support the strength biowaiver the applicant stated that all strengths have the

same manufacturer and qualitative composition, are dose proportional and present comparable in vitro

dissolution profile as the reference product in line with the requirement of the Guideline on the

Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98/Rev.1/ Corr ). This is further discussed in

the quality part of this report.

The conduct of a single BE study with the highest strength under fasting conditions was in line with the

dasatinib product-specific bioequivalence guidance (EMA/CHMP/675838/2014) version 1 in effect when

the application was submitted. However during the procedure the guidance was updated

(EMA/CHMP/675838/2014/Rev1/2020) and a fed study was also requested. During the assessment the

applicant submitted results of a fed study performed with the 100mg strength using the US reference

to respond to issues raised. The fed study was not required during the submission and therefore is only

considered as supportive.

Study 2185: A Single-Dose, Randomized, Open-Label, Four-Way Fully Replicate, Pivotal,

Bioequivalence Study of Dasatinib 140 mg Film-coated Tablets (Pharmascience Inc., Canada) and

SPRYCEL (dasatinib) 140 mg Filmcoated Tablets (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG, UK) in Healthy

Male Volunteers under Fasting Conditions
#### • Study design

The applicant has submitted a comparative bioequivalence study protocol number 2185 version

number 01 dated 20 October 2017 which was approved by the Optimum Ethics Review Board, Ontario,

Canada on 25 October 2017.

This was a randomised, balanced, open label, single dose, four-way fully replicate, two sequence, two

treatment, comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of dasatinib

140 mg film-coated tablets (Pharmascienice Inc, Canada) and Sprycel (dasatinib) 140 mg film-coated

tablets (MAH: Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharma EEIG, UK) in 60 healthy, adult male subjects under fasting

conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both

products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety and tolerability of a single dose of

dasatinib 140 mg.

The study centre was BioPharma Services Inc Canada. The studies were conducted between 29

November 2017 and 13 February 2018 and bioanalysis was performed between 02 January 2018 and

11 January 2018.

Subjects who met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive the study drugs according

to one of the two dosing sequences A-B-A-B or B-A-B-A. A total of 30 subjects were planned to receive

treatment sequence A-B-A-B and 30 subjects were planned to receive sequence B-A-B-A.

Subjects randomised to the A-B-A-B sequence received the test product (Treatment A: Dasatinib 140

mg tablets) in period 1 and period 3, and then following a 7 days washout period, received the

reference product (Treatment B: Sprycel 140 mg film-coated tablets) in period 2 and period 4.

Subjects randomised to the B-A-B-A sequence received the reference product (Treatment B) in period

1 and period 3, and then following a minimum 7 days washout period, received the test product

(Treatment A) in period 2 and period 4. The washout period of at least 7 days was estimated to be

adequate in avoiding carry-over effects of the preceding treatments.

Subjects were dosed consecutively according to the randomisation scheme beginning at 08:01 on:

November 30, 2017 for Period 1, December 07, 2017 for Period 2, December 14, 2017 for Period 3, and

December 21, 2017 for Period 4.

Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in both periods

each volunteer received their assigned formulation with 240 ± 3 mL of ambient temperature water at

their scheduled timepoint. Subjects were instructed not to touch, chew, bite or break the study drug. No

fluid was allowed from one hour before dosing until one hour after dosing. Subjects were dosed while in

sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for the first 4 hours following

drug administration.

Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose and at 0.17, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25,

1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours after dosing. Blood sampling time

adjustments are presented in the dossier.

Drop outs:

Two subjects withdrew voluntarily from the study and two subjects were removed by the Investigator

due to testing positive for drugs of abuse.
#### • Analytical methods Analysis of dasatinib was performed using test method RDPM257 . This Ultra Performance Liquid

Chromatography Method with Tandem mass spectrometry method involved the extraction of Dasatinib

d8 (internal standard) from human plasma. Throughout sample collection and following centrifugation,

the samples were maintained in an ice-bath until stored in the freezer. All plasma samples were

shipped by courier in dry ice, and the first set of samples were received frozen and in good condition

by the bioanalytical facility on 28 December 2017.

Total long-term plasma stability has been provided for 100 days at nominal temperature of -20°C and

28 days at nominal temperature of -70°C which covers the 42 days at -20°C (November 30, 2017 –

January 11, 2018) from the first collection date to last extraction date.

4618 blood samples were expected and 4618 were received. All the samples received were analysed.

**Bioanalytical report:** The bioanalytical report dated 2 March 2018 was submitted with 20% of the

subject chromatograms presented as well as the method SOP. Dasatinib d8 was used as an internal

standard (IS) and was sourced from TLC Pharmaceutical Standards. Certificates of analysis for the test

and reference drug products as well as for the drug standards used for dasatinib and the internal

standard dasatinib d8 have been provided and are deemed acceptable.

The inter day coefficient of variation (%CV) for the quality control samples at concentrations of 3.00

ng/mL (QC A), 100.00 ng/mL (QC B), 160.00 ng/mL (QC C) and 40.00 ng/mL (QC D) were 3.6%,

2.4%, 2.8% and 2.7% respectively and the inter day % Bias were 0.2%, 0.0%, 1.0% and 0.7%,

respectively.

Calibration range: 1.00ng/ml to 200.00 ng/ml (8 point curve)

**Reanalysis:** 101 samples were re-assayed (2.2%). There were 86 re-assays for COACR (concentration

outside accepted calibrated range) and 15 re-assays for LS (lost sample). The reason for their repeats

was documented and presented.

**Incurred Sample Reanalysis:** 288 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis however

they did pass the set limits: The total of 100.00% ISR samples were found to be within ±20% of the

mean of their original assay values.

**Validation of the test method:** The method was validated (RDPV257) in February 2017. The

following parameters were addressed; selectivity and specificity of dasatinib and the internal standard

(IS), calibration curve (linearity), carryover test, matrix effect precision and accuracy, LLOQ and ULOQ,

recovery of both the analyte and the internal standard, intra and inter assay precision and accuracy,

dilution integrity accuracy and precision, freeze-thaw (4 cycles), long term stability at -20°C and 
70°C, lipaemic effect precision and accuracy, haemolysis effect accuracy and precision, concomitant

medication interference (acetaminophen, caffeine, chlorpheniramine, ibuprofen, naproxen,

pseudoephedrine) and metabolite interference (metabolites 4’-hydroxy dasatinib and dasatinib N
oxide), short term stability (bench top) at room temperature, processed sample stability at 4°C, stock

solution stability of dasatinib and internal standard at -20°C and at room temperature, Internal

standard working solution stability at 4°C and at room temperature. Each parameter has been

assessed and the limits are justified. This is deemed acceptable.

**Pharmacokinetic variables**

**Primary parameters:** AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf and C max

**Secondary parameters:** T max, Residual area, Elimination rate constant, T 1/2
#### • Bioequivalence criteria; B ioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence interval of

geometric mean of Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf between test and reference products fall

within the range of 80.00 % to 125.00 % for Dasatinib. • Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics (min, max, median, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation) of all

PK parameters were to be provided for dasatinib for the test and reference products.

The within-subject standard deviation (SWR and SWT) of the test and the reference products was to be

determined for the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax.

The inter-subject and intra-subject CV were to be calculated for the in-transformed pharmacokinetic

parameters AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax.

Average bioequivalence was to be used to determine bioequivalence first. If bioequivalence was not

met for Cmax, scaled-average-bioequivalence could have been used if both of the following conditions

are met:

  - The point estimate of the geometric mean ratio was within the 80.00- 125.00% range;

  - The reference-to-reference within-subject coefficient of variation (CV) was > 30%, and was not

the result of outliers

Average Bioequivalence

ANOVA including sequence, subjects nested within sequence, period and treatment was to be

performed on the ln-transformed data for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax.

The 90% CI of the test/reference ratios of geometric means for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax was to be

calculated based on the LSMEANS and ESTIMATE of the ANOVA.

**Table 3:** Statistical analysis for dasatinib 140mg (fasting) (in-transformed values)

**Outliers**

Upon review of the concentration data, it was noted that **subject 34** demonstrated concentration

values that were below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) for periods 1, 3, and 4, while having

demonstrated measurable concentration values for period 2 only. Since subject 34 does not fulfil the

PK data set criteria defined in section 11.1 of the protocol, which states that subjects should have

measurable concentration data from at least two periods, data from subject 34 was not included in the

PK stats analysis and is instead presented separately.

Initially, data from all 56 subjects who completed, and demonstrated measurable concentration values

for, at least 2 periods of the study were included in the PK stats analysis, as per protocol.

It was noted that **subject 60** demonstrated very low concentration values for both reference arms,

where their individual AUC values for the reference were less than 5% of the geometric mean AUC

value of the reference product, which was calculated upon exclusion of their data. As per protocol, the

data obtained from the reference arms for subject 60 were to be excluded from PK stats analysis.

However, since both sets of reference data were excluded, the entirety of concentration data obtained

from subject 60 were omitted from PK stats analysis, since a test/reference comparison was no longer

possible. Data from 55 subjects were included in the final PK stats analysis.

Subject **52 and 54** demonstrated very low concentration values in period 2, after both having been

dosed with the reference. Both subjects showed individual AUC values for the reference during period 2

that were less than 5% of the geometric mean AUC value of the reference product, which was

calculated upon exclusion of their data. Period 2 data was excluded from PK stats analysis for subjects

52 and 54.

#### • Safety data

There were 46 adverse events involving 20 subjects in this study. No serious AEs were reported during

the conduct of this study.

There were 23 AEs associated with 15 subjects who received treatment A (test). There were three

instances of diarrhoea after administration with treatment A in this study.

EMA/116969/2022 Page 24/29


-----

There were 23 AEs associated with 12 subjects who received treatment B (reference). There were three

instances of diarrhoea and one instance of vomiting after administration with treatment B in this study.

All subjects underwent urine tests for drugs of abuse, cotinine, and an alcohol test at check-in for each

study period. All test results at check-in for drugs of abuse, cotinine, and breath alcohol were negative

with the exception of test results for subjects 36 and 51 who were positive to DOA test at period 2

check-in. Both subjects were dismissed from the study due to this positive test.

In addition, a complete blood count (CBC) was performed on all subjects at each period check-in. All

test results at check-in for complete blood count were within normal range or deemed Not Clinically

Significant by the Investigator.

The clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) were repeated prior to

discharge at the end of the study or after termination of subjects from the study. There were no

screening, on study or post-study laboratory results outside of normal range that were deemed

Clinically Significant by the Investigator.

##### **2.4.3. Discussion on clinical aspects **

The results discussed above show that the PK parameters of the bioequivalence study pass the

requirements of the guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence where the applicant states that

the 90% confidence intervals calculated for the primary parameters C max and AUC 0-t for dasatinib fall

within the 80.00 – 125.00% acceptance range after single dose administration under fasting

conditions. The submission of a single BE study in the fasted state was in line with the requirements of

the product-specific BE guidance for dasatinib at the time the application was submitted.

It is noted that the product-specific BE guidance for dasatinib has since been revised. It specifically

mentions the issue of outliers (these were the cause of concern in the major objection raised at day

120). In fact the guideline states that “Some subjects may randomly exhibit low concentrations of

dasatinib when taking dasatinib products in the fasted state. Therefore, these products are considered

with specific formulation characteristics and, consequently, bioequivalence should be evaluated under

fasting and fed conditions”

Hence a major objection was raised by the CHMP and the applicant was asked to discuss the issue of

variabilitiy in dasatinib exposure in that some subjects which may randomly exhibit low concentrations

of dasatanib when taking dasatinib products in the fasted state. As these products are considered with

specific formulation characteristics and bioequivalence should be evaluated under fasting and fed

conditions the applicant was asked to address the lack of a fed study and to assess the impact of food

on the variability of this product. The applicant was requested to justify providing a fasting study only

taking account of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence where “subjects with very low

plasma concentrations may be excluded if AUC is less than 5% of reference medicinal product

geometric mean AUC.”

The applicant submitted a fed study on the 100 mg strength compared to the US innovator product for

dasatinib using parameters approved by FDA for variable drugs. The results of sasatinib fed study have

been re-analysed against EMA bioequivalence criteria and statistical method. The test product dasatinib

100 mg film-coated tablets demonstrated a comparable extent of absorption of dasatinib to the

reference product Sprycel (dasatinib) 100 mg film-coated tablets with a test/reference (T/R) geometric

mean ratios (GMR) of approximately 97% for AUCt, with the corresponding 90% CI contained within

the EMA-acceptance range 80.00% - 125.00%. The test product also demonstrated a comparable rate

of absorption of dasatinib to the reference product with a T/R GMR of approximately 86% for Cmax

within the EMA-acceptance range 80.00% - 125.00% and corresponding 90% CI contained within the

EMA-widening acceptance range 78.25 127.80%. In parallel, the applicant performed a

physicochemical comparison of the EU reference and US reference product Sprycel comparing also

their dissolution profiles illustrating their similarity.

The fed study falls within the acceptance range for 90%CI for the AUC but not for the Cmax. The

geometric mean ratios are 97% for AUCt and 85% for Cmax. For Cmax the 90% CI are contained

```
within the EMA-widened acceptance range 78.25 127.80% for variable drugs. The applicant seems to

be using the FDA reference scaled and unscaled bioequivalence system for variable drugs. The

applicant concluded that in line with the protocol and based on the results of the reference scaled and

unscaled approach, BE is demonstrated under fed conditions.

The study is considered to be supportive of the argument requested in the major objection but not

valid for the EU since the reference product used is sourced from the US market and since it is not

performed on the highest and most sensitive strength. The major objection raised due to the change of

EU guidance after submission was therefore considered to be resolved.

In terms of safety a total of 22 mild and 1 moderate AEs were experienced by the subjects after taking

the test product. A total of 21 mild and 2 moderate AEs were experienced by the subjects after taking

the reference product. No AEs associated with clinical laboratory tests were experienced by the

subjects at post-study. No serious adverse events were reported during the conduct of this study. The

two products exhibited a similar safety profile.
##### **2.4.4. Conclusions on clinical aspects **

Based on the presented bioequivalence study 2185, dasatinib 140mg film-coated tablets is considered

bioequivalent with Sprycel 140mg film-coated tablets (dasatinib) in normal, healthy, male volunteers

under fasting conditions. This application was submitted prior to the publication of the updated product

specific bioequivalence guideline for dasatinib hence a fasting study is appropriate. A supportive fed

study was also submitted however this cannot be considered as an extra study since the reference

product used is that of the US and the study was done on the 100mg strength (which is not the

highest strength in the range proposed.)

The results of study 2185 with 140mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 20mg,

50mg, 70mg, 80mg, and 100mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guidelines (refer to the

quality sections for further information).

The product is approvable from a clinical point of view and all issues have been resolved. ***2.5. Risk Management Plan ***

### **3. Benefit-risk balance **

This application concerns a generic version of dasatinib film-coated tablets. The reference product

Sprycel is indicated for

the treatment of adult patients with:

  - Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

and

the treatment of paediatric patients with:

  - newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.

No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the

available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.

From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and

pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical

overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered

sufficient.

The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a randomised, two-period, two-treatment

crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this

formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling

points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was

validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate.

The test formulation of Dasatinib Accord met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when

compared with the Sprycel. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters

AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of

[range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen

reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are

required beyond those included in the product information.
### **4. Recommendations **

***Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products***

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Dasatinib Accord is not similar to Blincyto, Iclusig,

Besponsa, Xaluprine and Kymriah within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No.

847/2000.

***Outcome***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the benefit-risk balance of Dasatinib Accord is favourable in the following indication:

Dasatinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with:

  - Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.

and

Dasatinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of paediatric patients with:

  - newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy.
