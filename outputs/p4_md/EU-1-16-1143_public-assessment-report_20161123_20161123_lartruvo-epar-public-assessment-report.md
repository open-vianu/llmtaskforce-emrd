### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1. Problem statement *** **2.1.1. Disease or condition **

Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumours. There are more than 50

histological subtypes of STS, associated with distinct clinical profiles, response to individual therapy and

prognosis. **2.1.2. Epidemiology **

STS accounts for less than 1.0% of all adult malignant cancer. Average incidence in the European Union (EU)

is approximately 4.7 per 100,000 (Stiller et al. 2013). Around 23.000 new cases are expected per year in the

European Union (Gatta, et al. 2011). STS has a high mortality rate and accounts approximately for 2% of

total cancer-related mortality (Burningham et al. 2012, Sharma et al. 2013).

STS affect patients much younger than common carcinomas do, even teenagers and children. **2.1.3. Aetiology and pathogenesis **

Although STS clinical variety probably reflects a similar richness in molecular alterations, platelet-derived

growth factor alpha (PDGFRα) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many subtypes. Mesenchymal cells

are PDGFR-positive and an autocrine loop is hypothesized to occur between sarcoma cells and themselves or

stroma cells (Miettinen, 2006). **2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis **

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are ubiquitous in their site of origin and are often managed with multimodality

treatment. All patients with an unexplained deep mass of soft tissues, or with a superficial lesion of soft

tissues having a diameter of >5 cm should be referred to reference centres for sarcomas and/or within

reference networks treating a high number of patients annually (ESMO 2014).

Depending on tumour stage, 5-year overall survival rates range from 15% to 90% (Howlader et al. 2014;

Gatta et al. 2011; ESMO 2014; NCI 2014). The median survival time in patients with metastatic STS is 11 to

15 months, and a small subgroup of these patients achieve long term survival. Survival is more dependent

upon disease biology rather than solely upon treatment-associated consideration (Van Glabbeke, et al.,

1999).

##### **2.1.5. Management **

Surgery is the gold-standard, and often only, curative treatment. Surgery is often confronted with difficult

clinical dilemmas among optimal resection with adequate disease-free margins and limb-preservation. STS

outside extremities, like those arising in the head-and-neck region, viscera or retroperitoneum, are

characterized by worse outcomes, reflecting difficulties in obtaining wide en-bloc resections.

Radiotherapy is often used to control local-recurrence in aggressive histological subtypes and/or when

appropriate margins cannot be obtained, but it has no effect on cure rates. There has been a long debate

around adjuvant chemotherapy. After several controlled clinical trials and meta-analysis, it is now widely

accepted that combination chemotherapy with anthracyclines and high-dose ifosfamide has a real but modest

impact in survival upon chemo-sensitive STS subtypes (Casali, 2015) when full doses of such a highly toxic

treatment can be administered, which is not the case in most patients over 40 years-old.

Some STS histological subtypes, when in advanced stage, are treated with well-defined chemotherapeutic

regimes, i.e. rhabdomyosarcoma. In others, like gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and a few more,

targeted therapy has become the gold standard. But most cases are either resistant to systemic therapy (like

low-grade liposarcoma) or are to be treated with general-purpose chemotherapy based on uncontrolled,

decades-old studies, with doubtful impact on survival. Little advance has been made neither in the

chemotherapy nor in the targeted-therapies eras. According to RARECARE (Gatta et al, 2011), an Europe
wide surveillance project for rare cancers, 40 to 60% of all STS cases will be in the advanced stage at some

point of their clinical course, most of them presenting with lung metastases. Their 5-year survival rates do

not exceed 50%, similar to what was to be expected forty years ago.

A brief account of current first-line therapies for advanced-STS is outlined below. Clinical research has been

confronted with a lack of knowledge regarding the molecular drivers of most sarcomas and with the usual

difficulties surrounding rare diseases. Not the easiest issue to deal with, STS enormous heterogeneity

challenges sarcoma clinical researchers with the dilemma of choosing between small but cohesive trials on

the one hand, and large ones but including a heterogeneous mix of different diseases on the other.

Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin have a response rate of 10% to 30% (Bramwell et al, 2003) and are

considered standard of care, if only because they are the oldest agents to be introduced in the palliative

treatment of disseminated STS. It is to be emphasized that no controlled trial has ever been conducted to

prove an overall survival (OS) advantage of anthracyclines over best supportive care. Nevertheless,

doxorubicin is widely considered the only legitimate comparator for clinical trials in the first-line setting of

advanced STS.

Adding ifosfamide to doxorubicin has been extensively investigated (Judson et al. 2014) but has failed to

show a consistent OS benefit while increasing toxicity.

Dacarbazine, a promising compound due to its initial response rate, failed to become a standard of care

because of its toxicity and low single-agent activity (Radaelli, 2014) and is now reserved for certain second
line combination schemes.

Pazopanib is a potent and selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks tumour

growth and inhibits angiogenesis. Recently approved for non-lipomatous advanced STS second-line

treatment, it has demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) in the second-line setting, but with

limited survival benefit, if any (Wilky et al. 2013). There are ongoing trials recruiting treatment-naïve

patients.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 11/115


-----

The combination of gemcitabine with docetaxel is used off-label for the treatment of metastatic STS fairly

frequently in the EU and USA. The combination was shown to yield superior PFS and OS compared to

gemcitabine alone, but with increased toxicity (Maki et al. 2007). Although most research has been done in

pretreated patients, many experts move this combination to the front-line treatment in certain STS, like

angiosarcoma, due to a its unusual high response rate.

Trabectedin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced STS, after failure of anthracyclines

and ifosfamide, or who are unsuited to receive these agents. It is more active in L-sarcomas

(leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma) than in other varieties (Sapponara, 2016). Initially rejected in USA but

conditionally approved by the EMA based on PFS data, it has recently been accepted by the FDA after further

research revealed an advantage also in OS.

In summary, front-line advanced-disease treatment of the vast majority of STS subtypes patients still rely on

doxorubicin, a 40-year old drug, based on historical non-controlled research. Although some progress has

been made in the second-line setting, it has not translated into OS benefits in the first-line treatment. New

effective wide-spectrum systemic therapeutic options for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or

metastatic STS is an unmet medical need.

***About the product***

Olaratumab is an antagonist of platelet derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFR-α), expressed on tumour

and stromal cells. Olaratumab is a targeted, recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1)

monoclonal antibody that specifically binds PDGFR-α, blocking PDGF AA, -BB, and -CC binding and receptor

activation. As a result, in vitro olaratumab inhibits PDGFR-α pathway signalling in tumour and stromal cells.

In addition, in vivo olaratumab has been shown to disrupt the PDGF R-α pathway in tumour cells and inhibit

tumour growth.

The Applicant claimed the following indication which has been approved by the CHMP:

Lartruvo is indicated in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with advanced soft

tissue sarcoma who are not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy and who have not

been previously treated with doxorubicin.

Olaratumab therapy must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in oncology. Patients should

be monitored during the infusion for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in a setting with

available resuscitation equipment.

The recommended dose of olaratumab is 15 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of

each 3 week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lartruvo is administered in combination

with doxorubicin for up to 8 cycles of treatment, followed by Lartruvo monotherapy in patients whose disease

has not progressed. Doxorubicin is given on day 1 of each cycle following the Lartruvo infusion.

After dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, olaratumab is administered as an

intravenous infusion over approximately 60 minutes. In order to accommodate larger infusion volumes that

may be needed for patients requiring higher doses, the duration of infusion should be increased such that the

maximum infusion rate of 25 mg/minute is not exceeded.

*Premedication*

Premedication with an H1 antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine) and dexamethasone (or equivalent medicinal

products) should be given, intravenously, 30–60 minutes prior to the olaratumab doses on days 1 and 8 of

Assessment report

-----

cycle 1 in all patients. For subsequent cycles, premedication with an H1 antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine)

should be given intravenously 30–60 minutes prior to each dose of olaratumab.

For patients who experience Grade 1 or 2 IRR, the infusion should be interrupted and paracetamol, H1

antagonist and dexamethasone (or equivalent medicinal products) administered as needed. For all

subsequent infusions, premedication with the following (or equivalent medicinal products) diphenhydramine

hydrochloride (intravenously), paracetamol, and dexamethasone, should be given.

In the event that intravenous administration of an H1 antagonist is not possible, equivalent alternative

premedication should be given (e.g. oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride at least 90 minutes prior to the

infusion).

*Posology adjustments for olaratumab*

For dose adjustment recommendations related to doxorubicin, refer to the current doxorubicin prescribing

information.

*Infusion-related reactions (IRRs)*

Recommendations for the management of olaratumab IRRs are provided in table 1.

**Table 1 – Management recommendations for infusion-related reactions (IRRs)**

|Toxicity gradea|n Management recommendations (any occurrence)|
|---|---|
|Grade 1-2|o l • Stop the infusion • Paracetamol, H1 antagonist and dexamethasone should be o administered as needed (see premedication section) n • Once the reaction has resolved, resume infusion at a 50 % decreased infusion rate.b t • Monitor patient for worsening of condition. • For subsequent infusions, please see premedication section.|
|Grade 3-4|c u • Immediately and permanently discontinue treatment with olaratumab (see section 4.4).|



a Grade per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03

b Once the infusion rate has been reduced for a Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reaction, it is recommended that the lower infusion rate be
utilized for all subsequent infusions. The infusion duration should not exceed 2 hours.

*Other non-haematology toxicities*

For serious Grade >3 non-haematologic toxicity deemed related to olaratumab, the dose of olaratumab

should be withheld until toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to pretreatment baseline. For subsequent

infusions, the dose should be reduced to 12 mg/kg for serious Grade 3 toxicities and to 10 mg/kg for Grade 4

toxicities. If a Grade 3 toxicity recurs despite the dose reduction, reduce dose further to 10 mg/kg. In case of

recurrence of a Grade 4 toxicity, treatment with olaratumab should be permanently discontinued.

*Neutropenia*

If neutropenic fever/infection or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 1 week occurs, administration of

olaratumab should be temporarily discontinued until the absolute neutrophil count is 1,000 / µL or higher and

then the dose of olaratumab should be resumed at the reduced dose of 12 mg/kg. If neutropenic

fever/infection or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 1 week recurs despite dose reduction, further

reduce dose to 10 mg/kg (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).

***Type of Application and aspects on development***

The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to

be of major public health interest. This was based on the outstanding longer survival observed for

olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin compared to monotherapy with doxorubicin as observed in the

pivotal study JGDG.

In addition, the applicant requested a conditional marketing authorisation and put forward the following

claims:

 - The benefit-risk balance is positive.

 - It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.

The applicant has initiated a confirmatory Phase 3 study, Study I5B-IE-JGDJ (JGDJ), in patients with

advanced STS; the first patient visit in Study JGDJ occurred in September 2015. Approximately 460 patients

will be included in this study, with enrolment estimated to be complete in the second half of 2017. Enrolment

has been planned to take into account the potential for early approvals in one or more regions or countries,

and assumes that once a country has approved the drug, no further patients would likely be included in the

study from that region. Approximately 40% of the patients are planned to come from North America, 30%

from EU, and 30% from other regions. The applicant is confident that the confirmatory Phase 3 Study JGDJ

can be completed even if accelerated assessment is granted.

- Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the improvement seen in OS in Study JGDG represents an

unprecedented benefit to patients with STS.

- The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that

additional data are still required. The applicant’s claim is based on the acceptable and monitorable

safety profile and the limited other effective options available to patients with STS
##### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

regions respectively.

**Manufacture, characterisation and process controls**

*Source, history and generation of the cell substrate*

Olaratumab is produced in mouse myeloma NS0 cells.

The general scheme for the transfection, selection, cloning, identification and subsequent banking of the

olaratumab production cell line was presented.

*Cell banking system*

A two-tier cell banking system of Master Cell bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) is used for the

manufacture of the active substance. A thorough description of the cell bank system has been provided,

demonstrating stability of the construct and suitability of the MCB and WCB to be used for production.

The protocol for the preparation of a replacement WCB is presented. A description of the

characterisation of cells at the limit of *in vitro* cell age used for production and the tests characterising these

cells including evaluation of viral safety have been provided.

*Manufacturing process and controls*

The active substance is manufactured at ImCLone Systems LLC, 33 ImClone Drive, Branchburg, New Jersey,

NJ 08876, USA.

The process controls applied to critical steps and intermediates during the manufacture of olaratumab active

substance include critical process parameters, critical in-process controls (IPCs), in-process specifications and

operational process parameters:

- Critical process parameter is a process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality

attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality

per ICH Q8 [R2].

- Critical IPC is a check (i.e. tests or measurements) performed during production to monitor and, if

appropriate, adjust the process to ensure active substance or finished product critical quality attributes will

be met.

- In-process specification is a test or analytical procedure with defined acceptance criteria that is performed

at the end of a unit operation to verify suitability for further processing per ICH Q8 [R2] and ICH Q9.

- Operational process parameter is a process parameter whose variability under normal operating conditions,

when controlled within an established range, has no impact on a critical quality attribute. The operational

process parameter limits and ranges are controlled within the batch records to ensure consistency in batch

manufacture.

The control strategy for the olaratumab active substance manufacturing process was developed in accordance

with the principles of quality risk management. A risk assessment was performed to identify process

parameters with the potential for having an effect on active substance critical quality attributes. Additional

studies were conducted to confirm the relationships of the identified process parameters and critical quality

-----

attributes. Results of these studies were assessed, in conjunction with historical clinical trial process

experience and platform knowledge, to establish the appropriate ranges for each unit operation.

*Process validation*

Process validation for olaratumab active substance manufacturing process was performed at the Branchburg

commercial manufacturing site to demonstrate that the commercial-scale manufacturing process performs

consistently and is capable of meeting pre-determined acceptance criteria.

Prospective process validation (also referred to as process consistency) was performed using the intended

commercial process. Process was used for the registrational clinical trial JGDG. The process validation of the

olaratumab active substance manufacturing process was performed using consecutive runs. The clearance of

process-related impurities was evaluated for selected unit operations in the olaratumab active substance

manufacturing process. The process does not produce process intermediates requiring long term storage.

Unless otherwise noted, active substance manufacturing was performed at. Process intermediates may be

held prior to commencing the subsequent unit operation. The hold time limits were set based on the shortest

of the three longest hold times at commercial-scale for each process intermediate but not less than hours.

The prospective, commercial-scale process validation successfully confirmed the olaratumab control strategy

and demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process performs consistently. In order to ensure that

the manufacturing process remains in a state of control during commercial production, a monitoring plan has

been established for routine production. Routine monitoring ensures that the manufacturing process remains

capable of consistently delivering quality product and demonstrates robustness of the process control

strategy.

Membranes, resins and filters reuse were validated, along with reprocessing at the filtration level.

*Manufacturing process development*

A comparability exercise was performed to demonstrate comparability of active substance manufacturing

processes and batches during development.

The comparability assessment to support changes consisted of the application of a battery of analytical tests

to active substance samples. Analytical testing comprised routine active substance release tests and

additional biochemical characterisation assays. Test results were compared qualitatively and, where

appropriate, quantitatively.

*Characterisation*

The structure of olaratumab has been elucidated using an extensive battery of physicochemical,

biophysical and biological techniques. Structural elucidation and characterisation was performed mainly on

lots produced using the proposed commercial manufacturing process. All available data are consistent with

the proposed structure of olaratumab.

The product- and process-related impurities in olaratumab were characterised.

**Specification**

Specification for olaratumab was established based on the quality of the product used in toxicological and

clinical testing, the stability of olaratumab, process variability, the variability of the analytical methods used

to analyse the active substance, and ICH guidelines.

The potency of olaratumab is determined based on its mechanism of action by an assay.

##### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality aspects of this dossier are well presented and the information it contains is considered

comprehensive.

A Major Objection was raised during the review regarding the validation of the finished product

manufacturing process. Satisfactory information has been submitted and therefore this issue was considered

solved. A number of Other Concerns were also identified which have been satisfactorily addressed by the

Applicant.

**Active substance**

*Manufacture, characterisation and process controls*

In relation to the cell banks, the Applicant was asked to provide the protocol to be followed to demonstrate

the stability of the MCB (quality profile and acceptance criteria) in case a replacement WCB is not

implemented within a five-year timeframe. The Applicant was also requested to submit a full scale

qualification protocol for the replacement of the WCB to be assessed prior approval of the present marketing

authorisation application. The requested information has been provided and so these issues are considered

solved.

The manufacturing process of the active substance is considered appropriately described. A number of minor

clarifications were requested and are now considered solved.

The Applicant states that refiltration (final filtration) will only be permitted in the event of a filter integrity

test or container closure integrity failure. The Applicant has clarified that, in the event of closure integrity

failure, refiltration is only permitted if microbial control of the batch was first demonstrated by meeting the

pre-filtration action limits. This clarification is accepted. The Applicant states that product quality testing will

be performed pre- and post-reprocessing for the first three olaratumab commercial batches that are re
filtered at the virus reduction nanofiltration unit operation.

Since the criticality of process parameters and IPCs is evaluated on the basis of the impact on critical quality

attributes, the Applicant was asked to justify how the acceptance criteria for the critical quality attributes

were initially determined. This has been presented and found acceptable.

*Characterisation*

Overall, the characterisation exercise performed by the Applicant is considered adequate to address the

complex pattern of glycosylation of olaratumab. *Control of active substance*

Tightening of some acceptance values was requested based on manufacturing experience. The Applicant

revised the specification which is now considered acceptable. *Stability*

The Applicant claimed a shelf life of 24 months for the commercial active substance olaratumab stored at the

recommended storage condition of 2-8°C.This was considered acceptable.

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the

CHMP recommended several points for investigation. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

A series of in vitro pharmacodynamic (PD) studies were conducted to characterize the nonclinical

pharmacology of olaratumab, including its specific binding to PDGFRα, ligand-blocking activity, and functional

inhibition of ligand-induced PDGFRα signalling. The antitumor activity of olaratumab alone and in combination

with chemotherapy in mice containing human xenograft tumours was also demonstrated. In addition, a

murine surrogate antibody (LSN338786, IMC-1E10) for olaratumab that binds to mouse PDGFRα was tested

for its anti-tumour activity and the enhancement of the effect of chemotherapy on a human lung xenograft

by targeting mouse stroma.

The nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of olaratumab was conducted in mice. Studies were

also conducted to characterize the PK and toxicokinetics (TK) of the murine surrogate antibody, LSN338786

(IMC-1E10). Olaratumab and IMC-1E10 were administered intravenously (i.v.) in these studies, which is the

intended clinical route of administration.

The toxicity and TK of olaratumab, as well as evidence of antidrug antibodies (ADA) to olaratumab and their

potential impact on olaratumab TK, were characterized in GLP-compliant studies after administration to

cynomolgus monkey (established as an appropriate species for toxicity testing based on similar binding

affinity of Olaratumab to human and monkey PDGFRα), by i.v. infusion over 5, 13 and 39 weeks, followed by

recovery periods of 7 or 8 weeks. Safety pharmacology endpoints (cardiovascular, respiratory, and central

nervous system) were evaluated in these repeat-dose studies. Studies to assess genotoxicity,

carcinogenicity, and developmental and reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted with olaratumab.

However, to assess reproductive and developmental toxicity, a scientific literature review was included in the

submission and an embryo-foetal study using mouse surrogate antibody of olaratumab (1E10) is being

conducted.
##### **2.3.2. Pharmacology **

***Primary pharmacodynamic studies***
###### **In vivo studies **

**Binding and Species cross-reactivity of Olaratumab**

Olaratumab binding to PDGFRα was evaluated by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The antibody

bound human PDGFRα immobilized onto ELISA plates with an affinity higher than a commercial anti-PDGFRα

**Effect of Olaratumab on PDGFR** α **Phosphorylation and PDGFR** α **- Mediated Signal Transduction**

Inhibition of PDGF AA and PDGF BB Binding to PDGFRα by IMC-3G3 and other anti- PDGFRα antibodies, was

evaluated in porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) Rα cells. Inhibition of PDGFRα phosphorylation and MAPK and

Akt activation induced by PDGF-BB, was also tested in the same cell line. Imatinib as well as a neutralizing

murine monoclonal antibody from R&D Systems were included in this experiment as positive control

inhibitors.

Among the panel of anti- PDGFRα antibodies produced, 3G3 and F12 were more efficient in inhibiting the

binding of radiolabelled PDGF AA to immobilized receptor (IC 50 0.24 and 0.16 nM, respectively) or to PDGFRα

expressed on the surface of PAE Rα tumour cells (IC 50 0.58 and 0.51 nM, respectively). These two antibodies

were also the more efficient in inhibiting the binding of PDGF BB to immobilized PDGFRα (IC 50 0.43 and 0.55

nM, respectively). Inhibition of PDGF-AA-induced PDGFRα phosphorylation by IMC-3G3 was dose dependent,

with 50% inhibition achieved at 0.25 nM.

**Effect of Olaratumab on Tumour Cell Proliferation and Characterization of Responsive Cell Lines**

The effect of olaratumab on the cell growth *in vitro* was evaluated at 100 µg/mL on a panel of 317 cancer cell

lines that were genetically characterized.

The results are shown below:

Olaratumab-sensitive cancer cell lines as well as additional sarcoma cell lines were characterized for *PDGFA*,

*PDGFC*, *PDGFRA*, and *PDGFRB* mRNA expression and for cell-surface levels of PDGFRα. Quantitative real-time

PCR (RT-qPCR) was then performed with the cDNA and TaqMan Gene Expression assays from Life

Technologies for quantification of total *PDGFRA*, *PDGFA*, *PDGFC*, and *PDGFRB* .

**Effect of Olaratumab on PDGFRα-Mediated Signal Transduction of Sarcoma and Rhabdoid Cancer**

**Cell Lines**

A-204 (Rhabdoid) and NCI-H1703 (NSCLC) cells were pretreated with Olaratumab before stimulation with

PDGF-AA. Inhibition of pPDGFRα, Akt and MAPK phosphorylation was determined by examining cell lysates

through Western blotting with antibodies specific for phospho-PDGFR alpha, phospho-Akt & phospho-MAPK.

The results are shown below:

**Effect of Olaratumab on PDGF-induced activation of PDGFRα on Prostate Stromal Cells and Lung**

**Cancer-associated Fibroblasts**

In these studies, human WS-1 skin fibroblasts, prostate stromal cells and lung cancer-associated fibroblasts

(CAF) were grown. Cells were treated with antibodies followed by the addition of PDGF-AA or PDGF-AA and

PDGF-CC cocktail, or PDGF BB or DD. The results are described as follows:

Olaratumab was demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of commercial prostate stromal cells induced by

stimulation with PDGF AA with an IC 50 of 1.39 nM, this inhibition was associated with the reduction of

PDGFRα phosphorylation.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 23/115


-----

In CAFs, treatment with the PDGF-AA and –CC ligand cocktail resulted in phosphorylation of the receptor and

the downstream effector proteins AKT and ERK Doxorubicin co-adminstration had no discernible effect on

effector protein phosphorylation. Olaratumab pretreatment resulted in nearly complete reduction in p-ERK

and p-AKT (to baseline levels) relative to IgG controls. olaratumab also inhibited the phosphorylation of

PDGFRα in human WS-1 skin fibroblasts stimulated with any of the PDGFR ligands including those α-selective,

such as AA and CC homodimers, but also the β-specific DD homodimer.

**Lack of Antibody-Dependent Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)**

**Olaratumab plus Chemotherapy Combination Studies in Sarcoma Cell-line and Patient-derived**

**Xenograft Models**

The association of olaratumab with doxorubicin (3 mg/kg) was tested in established SK-LMS-induced tumours

in immunodeficient mice. Olaratumab alone induced a reduction of tumour volumes at day 24 of about 30 %,

lower than that expected and the reduction did not reach statistical significance. Both doxorubicin alone and

the combination significantly reduced tumour growth at the same time point, inducing a reduction of about

70% and 50% with the combination and the chemotherapy alone, respectively, the difference between these

two arms was also not statistically significant.

In other studies, subcutaneous tumour xenografts were established by injecting SKLMS-1 (5×10 [6]

cells/mouse) or KHOS/NP (1×10 [6] cells/mouse) into female athymic nude mice. Mice were treated with saline

solution, doxorubicin, olaratumab and a combination of the 2 treatments. Results are shown in the figures

below:

In an additional study, a xenograft model (TTX) derived from an osteosarcoma tumour biopsy, utilized 4 to 6

week old female Balb/c mice. Mice were treated with Olaratumab alone doxorubicin alone, or the combination

of these two monotherapies. See figure below:

39-week study utilized an acid dissociation step. This validated assay demonstrates both adequate sensitivity

and drug tolerance needed to support accurate interpretation of immunogenicity and TK results.

*Absorption*

The single-dose PK of olaratumab after i.p. administration was investigated in female CD-1 mice to determine

a dosing regimen suitable for efficacy studies in tumour-bearing mice (Report 2139-03). The estimated T½

determined after administration of a single 20 mg/kg i.p. dose was 7.4 days.

The single-dose PK of olaratumab following i.p. administration as a solution in PBS was further characterized

in male nude athymic mice (Report 8315118). Systemic exposure to olaratumab increased with dose in mice,

but increases were less than dose proportional with an approximate doubling between 20 and 60 mg/kg. The

mean T½ determined after administration of a single i.p. dose was approximately 5.7 days. AUC 0-t values

(where t is 0 to 480 hours postdose) following administration of olaratumab 20 and 60 mg/kg (30000 and

60200 μg.hr/mL), were similar to AUC 0-inf ones (34300 and 66200 μg.hr/mL).

A pilot mouse PK study was conducted with the mouse surrogate mAb IMC-1E10 (Report 8315117). The PK

parameters of IMC-1E10 were determined following a single 5 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg I.V. bolus dose to non
fasted female CD-1 mice. The estimated T½ range in this study was 65 to 71 hours (2.7 to 3.0 days), which

supported a proposed dosing frequency (every 3 days) in a subsequent embryo-fetal development study.

AUC 0-t values following olaratumab administration at 5 and 150 mg are 1480 (AUC interval is 0 to 288

hours postdose) and 116000 μg.hr/mL (AUC interval is 0 to 360 hours postdose). Clearance of IMC-1E10

appeared to be dose-dependent, whereby clearance at 5 mg/kg was approximately 2.7 times higher than at

150 mg/kg.

No specific distribution/metabolism/excretion studies have been submitted in this application.
##### **2.3.4. Toxicology **

***Single dose toxicity***

No single dose toxicity studies were conducted with olaratumab. However, in the 5-week repeat dose study in

monkeys (study 7573-104) there was a 2 week delay after the first dose (5, 16, 50 mg/kg), showing no test

article-related effects on clinical observations or body weights. In addition, no signs of acute toxicity were

observed after administration of the highest single dose of olaratumab (75 mg/kg) in the 13 and 39-week

toxicity studies in monkeys (7573-105, 8201-235).

***Repeat dose toxicity***

The toxicity, TK, and immunogenicity of olaratumab were investigated after administration by i.v. infusion

over 5, 13, or 39 weeks to male and female cynomolgus monkeys.

***Genotoxicity***

No genotoxicity studies have been submitted in this application.

***Carcinogenicity***

No carcinogenicity studies have been submitted in this application.

***Reproduction Toxicity***

Based on knockout models and a review of the literature, it appears likely that disruption of PDGF/PDGFR

signalling would impair the proper functioning and/or development of tissues critical for embryo-foetal

development (EFD) leading to embryo-foetal lethality and teratogenicity. Studies in knock out mice have

shown developmental abnormalities, including defects in neural tube derivatives, testes, kidneys, heart and

vascular system, diaphragm, skeletal system, skin, hair, teeth, eyes, and palate, are likely to result from

disruption of PDGFR-α signalling (Morrison-Graham et al. 1992, Soriano 1997, Tallquist and Soriano 2003).

A pilot EFD study (Report 8323353) was conducted using the mouse surrogate antibody of olaratumab

(1E10) with the goal of demonstrating the severe developmental abnormalities suggested by the available

knock-out mouse data. Only minor developmental variations were observed, however, developmental results

from the pilot study were inconclusive based on several confounding factors; including endotoxin

contamination in the dose solutions, poor pregnancy rate, and an unusually high number of dosing procedure

deaths. Because the pilot study was not interpretable from a developmental perspective, a definitive GLP

mouse embryofoetal toxicity and toxicokinetics study (Study 8332306) was subsequently conducted with the

olaratumab surrogate mouse antibody (IMC-1E10) administered once every 3 days during organogenesis to

pregnant mice. In foetuses collected from the 50 mg/kg (mid dose) and 150 mg/kg (high dose) maternal

groups, there were increased incidences of malformations consisting of open eye and partially open eye as

well as increased incidences of skeletal variation frontal/parietal additional ossification site confirming a

developmental hazard consistent with that previously demonstrated by the knockout mouse model.

No animal studies have been performed to test olaratumab for fertility impairment.

***Toxicokinetic data***

Study 7573 - 104

The toxicokinetic behaviour of IMC-3G3 was nonlinear following Doses 1 and 4.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 32/115


-----

Statistical significance between males and females was observed in mean Cmax and mean AUC inf values in

the high dose group only.

After the first I.V. dose, AUC 0-inf increased more than proportionally with dose whereas C max appeared to

increase in a dose proportional manner. The elimination T½ for olaratumab increased with dose from

approximately 1.6 days to >5 days while clearance decreased in high dose males. Trough serum olaratumab

concentrations (C min ) measured prior to the second dose (2 weeks following the first dose), were detectable

for both males and females. Following the third and fourth doses, most pre-dose serum levels increased

relative to their respective values at the second dose, suggesting olaratumab accumulation in serum over

time.

Following Dose 4, rapid IMC-3G3 clearance was observed in some animals in all dose groups. In animals with

normal IMC-3G3 clearance following Dose 4, exposure generally increased in a greater than dose
proportional manner in all dose groups.

Immunogenicity analysis indicated that all pre-dose samples were negative for antibodies capable of binding

IMC-3G3. In the 5-mg/kg group, one of six Dosing Phase Day 35 samples was negative and five samples

were reported as positive for an immune response. In the 16-mg/kg group, all Dosing Phase Day 35 samples

were reported as negative. In the 50-mg/kg group, nine samples were reported as indeterminate due to the

concentration of IMC-3G3 (≥ 10 μg/mL) in the samples and one sample was reported as negative. All

Recovery Phase Day 48 samples from the 50-mg/kg group were reported as negative.

In addition, while many indeterminate ADA assignments were made in the 50-mg/kg dose group due to

interference from circulating olaratumab, the one animal in the 50-mg/kg group that did exhibit rapid drug

clearance on Day 29 after the fourth I.V. dose was negative for ADA on Day 35 in association with Day 36

olaratumab serum concentrations that were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ).

Study 7573 - 105

After a single I.V. dose, the T½ values increased with dose from 2.7 to 5.7 days and clearance decreased

with increasing dose level. The estimated volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) after 13 weekly doses

spanned the range of 32 to 39 mL/kg. Examination of Cmax and pre-dose (trough) concentrations at steady

state indicated that drug accumulation occurred in all dose groups over the 13-week study. Mean AUC0-inf

and Cmax at Week 13 increased up to 2.2-fold and 1.5-fold respectively, across all dose groups relative to

the first dose. Clearance decreased up to 57% by Dose 13. Rapid clearance of olaratumab was observed in 5

of 6 animals (3 males and 2 females) in the low-dose group and in 1 male of 6 animals in the mid-dose

group, although rapid clearance was not observed in any high dose group animals after repeated doses in the

13-week study. In the low-dose group, the 5 animals that exhibited rapid clearance were all positive for ADA

response on Day 91.

Study 8201 - 325

After IV infusion, IMC-3G3 concentrations slowly declined, generally in a bi-exponential manner. The mean

t1/2 values determined only from the recovery animals on Day 267 ranged from 28.2 to 76.1 hours. Mean CL

values on Days 120 and 267 ranged from 0.252 to 0.451 mL/hr/kg and generally appear to be dose and time

independent.

Mean Vz values determined only from recovery animals on Day 267 ranged from 8.23 to 24.6 mL/kg, did not

distribute beyond vasculature, and appeared to be dose independent. No apparent gender differences (> 2
fold) were observed in IMC-3G3 mean Cmax and AUC0-168 values. Values for mean Cmax and AUC0-168

-----

were approximately 40 to 140% higher on Day 120 and 40 to 180% higher on Day 267 than on Day 1,

indicating potential accumulation of IMC-3G3 after multiple dosing in cynomolgus monkeys.

The increases in mean Cmax and AUC0-168 for males and females were generally dose proportional.

Several animals (n=8; 5 in Group 2, 2 in Group 3, and 1 in Group 4) had measurable anti-drug-antibody

(ADA) on Days 120 and 267, resulting in significantly lower IMC-3G3 concentrations in those animals.

Pre/postnatal development studies have not been submitted in this application.

***Local Tolerance***

Local tolerance was investigated in the 5-week and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity evaluations in cynomolgus

monkeys by clinical observations, and as part of the histopathological evaluations (Reports 7573-104, 7573
105, and 8201-235). Intravenous administration of olaratumab was well tolerated and no treatment-related

adverse reactions at the injection site were observed.

***Other toxicity studies***

A tissue cross reactivity study using a commercially available rabbit anti-human PDGFRα antibody revealed

similar staining patterns in human and cynomolgus macaque tissues, further supporting the use of

cynomolgus monkeys for toxicology testing. Many, but not all, of the cell types demonstrating staining with

the Anti-PDGFRα antibody in this study have been reported to express PDGFRα.
##### **2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

Olaratumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to

the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal

Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), olaratumab is exempt from preparation of an

Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the

environment **2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

Olaratumab is a PDGFRα antagonist. The preclinical in vitro PD data show that olaratumab binds to human

PDGFRα with high affinity. In addition to blocking ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and cell

mitogenesis in cancer cells and normal stromal fibroblasts, olaratumab inhibits ligand-induced

phosphorylation of the downstream signalling molecules Akt and MAPK in multiple tumour cell lines. As a

Assessment report

-----

result, in cultured cancer cells, olaratumab treatment inhibited ligand-dependent growth of human tumour

cell lines.

The in vivo studies showed that olaratumab was able to inhibit tumour growth as a single agent in human

PDGFRα-expressing tumour xenograft models (glioblastoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdoid cancer, NSCLC). In

addition, olaratumab is able to downmodulate PDGFRα after one or two doses in a glioblastoma animal

model, and reduces the establishment and progression of skeletal metastasis in an animal model of prostate

cancer. Combination of olaratumab with doxorubicin in leiomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma models increased

tumour growth inhibition compared to either treatment alone.

Overall, Olaratumab has been shown to bind human PDGFRα and to inhibit the activation of the receptor

induced by its ligands. The relevance of the signalling pathways involving PDGFRα has been identified in

different cancer cell types and in particular in soft tissue sarcomas. The in vitro and in vivo results are

deemed relevant for the proposed indication, although the identification of the mechanism of action could not

be fully elucidated, in light of the discrepancies noted throughout all studies. The Applicant discussed the

necessity of identifying additional biomarkers predictive of olaratumab response. In the context of the

ongoing Phase 3 confirmatory trial (JGDJ), the applicant will further explore the expression of PDGFRα,

PDGFRβ, PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C, PDGF-D, EGF, TGFα, EGFR, VEGFa, CXCR4, TGFb, TOPO2A, and GLI1;

and key downstream pathways such as the Akt pathway with the aim of a better understanding of

olaratumab’s mechanism of action.

Efficacy in reducing tumour growth in experimental animal is associated with plasmatic concentrations above

200 µg/mL, achieved in immunodeficient mice with doses of 60 mg/kg. The evidences obtained in primary

pharmacodynamic studies are adequate to support clinical evaluation in humans.

The PK profile of olaratumab was consistent with that expected for a monoclonal antibody, with a T½ of 6-7

days in mice and 2-3 days in monkeys. Systemic exposure increased with dose in mice and monkeys. In

repeated dose toxicity studies in monkeys, olaratumab accumulated by a factor of 1.4- to 2.4 between first

and last dose. No sex-related differences were observed. Olaratumab ADAs were detected in several serum

samples in monkey studies. In mice, the embryo-foetal study suggests that the murine surrogate 1E10 can

be transferred from maternal to foetal blood.

Toxicity studies in monkeys showed no olaratumab-related adverse effects, with only a no-adverse mild to

moderate increase in alanine aminotransferase levels, minimal individual cell necrosis and moderate

infiltrates in the liver observed in one female treated at the highest dose in the 39-week study. In this study,

monkey serum C min was 1164 μg/mL at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 75 mg/kg, which

was approximately 4.5- to 7.5-fold greater than the threshold C min believed to be needed for antitumor

activity based on tumour xenograft models (155 to 258 μg/mL). The AUC 0-168hr following the last infusion of

75 mg/kg was 284976 μg•hr/mL, which was approximately 16.5-fold greater than olaratumab exposure

anticipated for antitumor activity in humans based on animal tumour models (AUC0-96hr = 17184

μg•hr/mL).

Studies to assess the genetic toxicity of olaratumab have not been conducted, which is in line with ICH

Guidances S6 and S9. There is no cause for concern based on the mechanism of action and physicochemical

makeup of olaratumab as is not expected to react with DNA or other chromatid material.

Carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients

with advanced cancer (ICHS9). In addition, there were no findings observed in the 39-week repeat-dose

study in monkeys that would indicate a carcinogenicity risk; thus, carcinogenicity studies have not been

conducted.

Regarding reproductive toxicity, the Applicant has submitted a comprehensive summary of the scientific

literature regarding the relevance of PDGF/PDGFRα in embryo-foetal development. PDGFRα activity has been

demonstrated in human, mouse and other nonmammalian tissue; however, as olaratumab is the first

monoclonal antibody directed specifically to PDGFRα, no information about the toxicity of other compounds of

the same class is available. It is acknowledged that due to the wide range of effects of PDGFRα in

embryo/neonate viability, brain, lung, eye, skin, CNS and heart development it is highly probable that

perturbation of the PDGFR pathway will lead to toxic effects on human embryo-foetal development. However,

results of the pilot embryo-foetal development study in mice with the olaratumab surrogate IMC-1E10 show

only some non-adverse effects in ossification at high doses, although interpretation of these data was

confounded by the presence of endotoxin in dose formulations, poor pregnancy rate and an unusually high

number of dosing procedure deaths. The Applicant also submitted the results of a GLP-compliant study

(Embryo-foetal developmental and toxicokinetic study in mice given LSN3338786). This study confirmed the

increased incidences of malformations (abnormal eyelid development) and skeletal alterations

(frontal/parietal additional ossification site) at exposures less than the AUC exposure at the maximum

recommended human dose of 15 mg/kg olaratumab. Thus, the potential risk to foetal development was

included in section 5.3 of SmPC.

The Applicant also claims regulatory and ethical reasons not to conduct a reprotoxicity study in non human

primates. Considering the involvement of PDGFRα in embryo-foetal development, it seems reasonable to

believe that even if no adverse effects were observed in primates, patients and prescribers would still be

informed with appropriate labelling of the potential risks of olaratumab to reproduction. Also taking into

account the severity of the disease and the target population of olaratumab, a reproductive toxicity study in

monkeys is not considered indispensable for marketing authorization.

There are no or limited amount of data from the use of olaratumab in pregnant women. As a consequence,

olaratumab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using

contraception, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Women of childbearing

potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on olaratumab and should be informed of the

potential hazard to the pregnancy and foetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use

effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 months following the last dose of olaratumab.

It is not known whether olaratumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is excreted in human milk,

therefore breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with olaratumab and for at least 3 months

following the last dose.

Olaratumab is composed of natural amino acids, the use of which will not alter the concentration or

distribution of amino acids in the environment. Therefore, olaratumab is not expected to pose a risk to the

environment.
##### **2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of olaratumab are well characterized.

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys.

The mechanism of action of olaratumab is not fully understood and the applicant will provide further

biomarker evaluation predictive of response within the context of the confirmatory phase 3 study JGDJ.

The PK of olaratumab was primarily characterized in a PopPK analysis including data from the following 4
studies.
**Table 3: Studies used for the PopPK analysis of olaratumab**
##### **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

***Absorption***

Olaratumab is administered as an intravenous infusion only and is therefore completely bioavailable.

***Distribution***

Traditional protein-binding studies using human serum ALB as conducted for small molecules are not

applicable to therapeutic biologics Further, non-specific interactions with plasma proteins were not expected

to occur with olaratumab. Therefore, plasma protein binding studies were not conducted with olaratumab.

The population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model-based mean (CV %) volume of distribution of olaratumab at

steady state (Vss) was 7.7 L (16 %).

***Elimination***

No studies on the metabolism of olaratumab have been performed in humans.

The PopPK model-based mean (CV %) clearance for olaratumab was 0.56 L/day (33 %). This corresponds to

a mean terminal half-life of approximately 11 days.

***Dose proportionality and time dependencies***

Phase 1 Study JGDC was conducted to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose of

olaratumab. Patients with advanced solid tumours and lymphomas who no longer responded to standard

therapy or for whom no standard therapy was available were enrolled in 5 cohorts. Patients in Cohorts 1

through 3 received doses 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg, respectively. A treatment cycle consisted of olaratumab

administered IV, once every week for 4 weeks followed by a 2- week observation period for each 6-week

cycle (for a total of 4 doses per cycle). Patients in Cohorts 4 and 5 received doses of 15 mg/kg and 20

mg/kg, respectively. A treatment cycle consisted of olaratumab, administered IV, every 2 weeks for each 4
week cycle, for a total of 2 doses per cycle.

A total of 19 patients were treated with olaratumab as monotherapy in Study JGDC.

Olaratumab C max and AUC(0-168) increased with dose across the dose range tested. Olaratumab geometric

mean t 1/2 ranged from 3.08 to 8.96 days following both single and multiple infusions.

**Figure 3: Olaratumab clearance (CL) following the first infusion (first dose) versus dose (Study JGDC)**

Study JGDF, a Phase 1, dose-escalation study enrolled Japanese patients with advanced solid tumours who

had not responded to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy was available. Patients were

enrolled sequentially into 1 of 3 cohorts, each comprising a minimum of 3 patients. Patients in Cohort 1

received olaratumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks, patients in Cohort 2 received a

dose of 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and patients in Cohort 3 received a dose of 15 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8

every 3 weeks.

A total of 16 Japanese cancer patients were treated with olaratumab.

An NCA was conducted for 3 patients from Cohort 1, 6 patients from Cohort 2, and 6 patients from Cohort 3.

Olaratumab t 1/2 ranged from 4.06 to 9.38 days following single- and multiple dose administration in both

dosing schedules.

The terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) ranged from 4.42 to 9.38 days across all dose ranges and dosing

schedule. Due to the relative short PK sampling time (336 hours) post end of infusion, the true terminal

elimination phase may not have been completely captured and accurately estimated. Therefore, t 1/2 and its

associated parameters including AUC(0-∞) and CL should be interpreted with caution. PK parameters,

including AUC(0-∞), CL, and Vz, were not calculated for the 10-mg/kg and 15-mg/kg (q3w) dose groups

because of unique dosing schedule (patients received first infusion on Day 1 and second infusion on Day 8 in

a 21-day-cycle [q3w]). Olaratumab Cmax following the first infusion appeared to increase with dose.

There was no apparent difference in the time course of olaratumab serum levels between Japanese patients

and United States patients (Study JGDC).

***Intra- and inter-individual variability***

The population PK model showed a low to moderate inter-individual variability (%CV) for CL (33.3%) and for

V1 (15.6%).

***Pharmacokinetics in target population***

Population pharmacokinetic analysis

A Population PK analysis was performed pooling data from 4 studies (JGDB, JGDE, JGDG, JGDH) where

olaratumab was administered at 2 dose levels (15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) and with different dose intervals

(Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, and Day 1 of a 14-day cycle). In these studies, olaratumab was

administered both as a single agent and in combination with several chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin,

paclitaxel/carboplatin) and to patients with several tumour types.

The PK of olaratumab was characterized by means of nonlinear mixed-effect modeling using the program

NONMEM Version 7.3. The population PK dataset included data from 171 patients whose ages ranged from 22

to 82 years at study entry and who weighed between 37.3 and 151 kg. The number of PK samples per

patient ranged from 1 to 54 with a median of 5 samples.

The PK of olaratumab was well characterized by a 2-compartment PK model, and olaratumab elimination was

best characterized by a linear clearance term. The model appeared to perform adequately. The population

estimates of Vss (7.74 L) and CL parameters (0.0233 L/h) were essentially those expected for an IgG

antibody.

Nonlinear saturable clearance did not significantly contributed to overall clearance, indicating that at

therapeutic doses there is saturation of target-mediated drug disposition. WTE was found to be a significant

covariate for both CL and V1. Tumour size was also found to have a significant effect on CL, with a larger

tumour burden associated with higher CL. However, taking into account that saturable, target-mediated

clearance did not contribute significantly to the overall clearance, this finding is difficult to interpret. Inter
patient variability on the PK parameters of the final PopPK model was 33.3% for CL and 15.6% for V1.

The parameter estimates of the final PopPK model are shown in the table below.

***Special populations***

   - **Impaired renal function**

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the PK of olaratumab.

Renal function (as calculated by Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance [CLcr; range investigated 40.2-250

mL/min]), in the PopPK analysis was found to be non-significant when tested continuously. The effect of renal

function on the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab was evaluated based on data from 143 patients: 85 patients

had normal renal function, 43 patients had mild renal impairment (CLcr = 60-89 mL/min), and 15 patients

had moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 30-59 mL/min). No patients had severe renal impairment.

   - **Impaired hepatic function**

No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of olaratumab.

Hepatic function in the PopPK analysis (as assessed by alanine aminotransferase [4-88 U/L], aspartate

transaminase [5-96 U/L], and total bilirubin [1.71-25.6 μmol/L]) was found to have no significant effect on

-----

the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab. Hepatic function was evaluated based on the Liver Function

Classification from the National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (Ramanathan et al.

2008). The effect of hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab was evaluated based on data

from 143 patients: 126 patients had normal hepatic function, 16 patients had mild hepatic impairment, and

1 patient had moderate hepatic impairment. No patients had severe hepatic impairment.

   - **Weight**

In the PopPK analysis, body weight was found to have a significant effect on both the CL and V1. The effect

of WTE was, however, less than directly proportional on both parameters, with exponent values of

approximately 0.5. Compared with flat dosing, the body weight-based dosing paradigm currently adopted for

olaratumab is therefore not expected to inflate PK variability on either CL or V1 (Zhang et al. 2012). This was

verified by comparing the simulated time course of olaratumab when used at the dose of 15 mg/kg on Days 1

and 8 of a 21-day cycle with that when olaratumab is dosed at the dose of 1200 mg (following the same

dosing regimen), which corresponds to the flat dose administered to a patient with the median WTE of 80 kg

(see figures below).

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 45/115


-----

   - **Tumour size**

Tumour size at the time of study entry (evaluated as a continuous variable) was found to have an effect on

CL, where a higher CL was associated with larger tumour size.

   - **Gender, Race, Age**

Sex (84 males, 87 females), age (range, 22 to 82 years), or race (86% Caucasians, 8.8% African Descent,

1.8% Asians, 0.6% Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, 2.9% others) did not have any effect on the

pharmacokinetics of olaratumab.

   - **Elderly**

Age, investigated in the range of 22 to 82 years was not a statistically significant covariate on the

pharmacokinetics of olaratumab.

No data in children are available The safety and efficacy of olaratumab in children aged 0 to 18 years of age

have not yet been established.

***Pharmacokinetic interaction studies***

No in vitro data is available regarding interaction potential.

As the PopPK analysis was performed using a PopPK database containing olaratumab serum data collected

from patients who received olaratumab as a single agent (n = 73) as well as in combination with

paclitaxel/carboplatin (n = 45) or doxorubicin (n = 53 ), the assessment of the effect of doxorubicin and

paclitaxel/carboplatin on the PK of olaratumab was performed by means of PopPK modeling. No difference in

olaratumab clearance was observed between individuals who received olaratumab or in combination with

chemotherapy, regardless of the combination examined. Likewise, there was no difference in V1 between

patients who received olaratumab as a single agent and those who received olaratumab in combination with

either paclitaxel/carboplatin or doxorubicin. Concomitant chemotherapy (doxorubicin or

paclitaxel/carboplatin) had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab.

In a dedicated study (JGDI) it was found that olaratumab had no effect on the PK of co-administered

doxorubicin.
##### **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics **

***Mechanism of action***

No mechanism of action studies has been conducted.

***Primary and Secondary pharmacology***

No pharmacodynamic (PD) study has been performed.

A **PK/PD analysis** to characterize the exposure-response relationship for efficacy (PFS and OS) and safety

in patients with advanced STS. The source response data were from the final database used in the efficacy

analyses for Study JGDG. OS and PFS were described using a time-to-event modelling approach implemented

using NONMEM Version 7.3.

The PK exposure parameters were estimated using the final population PK model. Two exposure parameters

were selected: 1) individual trough concentrations after the first treatment cycle (C min1 ); 2) individual

average concentrations throughout patients treatment (C avg ), defined as the overall AUC throughout the

treatment duration divided by the duration of the treatment. For both PK endpoints, the effect of olaratumab

on OS was best accounted for by an inhibitory E MAX drug effect model with Hill coefficient on the hazard

function.

Estimates for the baseline hazard and E MAX parameters were similar regardless of the PK endpoint

considered. For OS, E MAX, with a value of approximately 0.75 in both models, corresponds to a maximum

predicted 75% reduction in the hazard ratio, down to value of 0.25. In addition, with values of 66.1 and 134

μg/mL, respectively, the final EC min1 50 and EC avg 50 estimates correspond to the 25th percentile of the

distribution of C min1 and C avg in Study JGDG. ECOG and the number of prior lines of treatment were found to

be the only significant covariates affecting the baseline hazard for both the C min1 - and C avg -based models. No

covariates were found to impact the parameters describing olaratumab activity itself.

**Figure 6: Predicted effect of olaratumab on the HR for overall survival**

The impact of exposure (in terms of C min1 and C avg ) on efficacy was also evaluated by performing a matched

case-control (MCC) analysis comparing OS and PFS in each subgroup of the Investigational Arm, defined by

quartiles of C min1 and C avg, to that in a matching subgroup of the Control Arm. Each matched subgroup of the

Control Arm was selected by matching patients’ propensity scores over 7 potential prognostic covariates.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 48/115


-----

**Table 10: Matched-Case Control Analysis of Overall Survival in Phase 2 Study JGDG; Cmin1 and Cavg Quartiles**

The MCC analysis shows that patients in the lowest exposure quartile tended to experience disease

progression within the first 2 to 3 cycles of treatment and, unlike the other quartiles, did not have OS

improvement. This was true for both PK parameters, C min1 and C avg .

The Applicant hypothesized that patients in the lowest exposure quartile might progress because

concentrations do not reach potentially therapeutic levels (C min1 ≥ 65.9 µg/mL) early enough during the

course of treatment (steady state being not reached before Cycle 3); and, consequently, that clinical

outcome for the lowest exposure quartile could be further improved if patients were able to achieve higher

serum concentrations earlier in treatment. Based on this hypothesis the Applicant used the developed PopPK

model to devise an improved dosing strategy for the Phase 3 Study in STS. This dosing strategy consists of

'loading' doses of 20 mg/kg administered on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1 followed by 15 mg/kg administered on

Days 1 and 8 of every subsequent cycle. According to the PK model, this dosing strategy would allow steady
state olaratumab serum levels to be achieved as soon as the first cycle, and would significantly reduce the

percentage of patient whose C min1 falls below 66 μg/mL at the start of treatment. Importantly, with the

loading 20 mg/kg dose during the first cycle C max is predicted to remain within the overall range observed in

Study JGDG, which had an acceptable and monitorable safety profile. In addition, the exposure-safety

analysis showed that the rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Study JGDG did not increase

with increasing olaratumab serum exposure.

**Immunogenicity**

The overall incidence of TE-ADA was 3.5% (13 of 370) in all evaluable olaratumab-treated patients from 9

studies. Incidence in STS patients from Study JGDG was 5.9% (5/85). Neutralizing antibodies were detected

in all patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-olaratumab antibodies.

**Qtc interval**

QTc data were collected when olaratumab was administered at the dose of 15 mg/kg. Visual inspection

revealed no relationship between ΔQTcF values and olaratumab concentrations. In addition, the 90%

confidence interval (CI) for the slope of the regression line contained zero, and the upper limit of the 90% CI

at Cmax excluded 10 ms, indicating lack of a concentration-QT effect.

##### **2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology **

The clinical pharmacology of olaratumab is mainly supported by data from studies JGDG, JGDB, JGDD, JGDE,

JGDH, JGDI together with the population pharmacokinetic analysis (including data from Studies JGDG, JGDB,

JGDIE, JGDH). Pharmacokinetics has mainly been documented in patients with different type of tumours and

not in healthy volunteers.PK of olaratumab was sufficiently characterized, mainly by PopPK analysis.

The dose proposed for olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin is 15 mg/kg administered intravenously

over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each 3 week cycle. The population pharmacokinetic analysis and

exposure response analyses have been essential to support relevant issues about the clinical pharmacology

of olaratumab, importantly the dose regimen.

Overall, the bionalytical methods applied for the determination of olaratumab, doxorubicin in human serum

as well as for the determination of ADAs are acceptable.

The pharmacokinetics of olaratumab administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion of 15 mg/kg on Days 1 and

8 of a 21-day cycle or 20 mg/kg on Day 1 of a 14-day cycle was well characterized by a 2-compartment

model with linear elimination. Nonlinear saturable clearance did not significantly contributed to overall

clearance, indicating that at therapeutic doses there is saturation of target-mediated drug disposition.

Systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) at steady state were 0.0233 L/h and 7.74 L,

respectively which is in line with data from other IgG mAb. This corresponds to a half-life of approximately 11

days, and a time to steady state of approximately 50 days. Interindividual variability in PK parameters was

low to moderate (15.6% to 33.3%). NCA showed that after administration of 15 mg/kg olaratumab on Days

1 and 8 of each 21-day treatment cycle, mean Cmax,ss ranged from 400 to 600 µg/mL, approximately, and

mean Cmin,ss ranged from 140 to 190 µg/mL, approximately.

No studies in any special populations (renal impairment, hepatic impairment, age, race, gender) have been

performed, which is acceptable for an IgG antibody. Several variables were tested as covariates in the popPK

analysis, and only body weight and tumour size were found to have an effect on clearance and volume of

distribution and clearance respectively (see sections 5.2 of the SmPC). Dosing per body weight is acceptable.

No pharmacokinetic interactions through metabolic enzymes or transporters are expected for a PDFR 
antibody. No interaction was observed in the PK of doxorubicin when administered in combination with

olaratumab (JGDI study). The final results of study JGDI will be submitted by the applicant by December

2017 (see RMP). No other formal DDI studies with olaratumab and medicinal products commonly used in

cancer patients, including those with STS (e.g. antiemetics, analgesics, anti-diarrheal drugs, oral

contraceptives, etc.), have been performed.

As monoclonal antibodies are not metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other drug

metabolising enzymes, inhibition or induction of these enzymes by co-administered medicinal products is not

anticipated to affect the pharmacokinetics of olaratumab. Conversely, olaratumab is not anticipated to affect

the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medicinal products (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

There was no evidence of prolongation of QTcF following administration of olaratumab.

A Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic analysis of olaratumab was presented. PDGFR-α expression

(positive or negative) was not investigated as a covariate but theoretically should influence the effect of

olaratumab. On the other hand, an exploratory subgroup analysis of efficacy indicated that the benefit in

terms of OS was essentially confined to the PDGFR-α negative subgroup, which appears to be a paradox.

Post-hoc analyses performed by the Applicant indicate that PDGFRα status should not have any relevant

-----

effect on the drug disposition. PDGFRα status tested as a covariate in the OS survival model did not provide a

statistically significant improvement to the model fit.

A highly significant finding of the exposure-response analysis was that only patients whose Cmin1 was above

the lower quartile showed an improvement in OS. This was true for both PK parameters, Cmin1 and Cavg.

The Applicant concludes that patients with low serum concentration of olaratumab may benefit from a higher

dose and this led to the proposal of a modified posology for the planned phase 3 study, which includes

loading doses to be administered in cycle 1. This kind of exposure-response pattern has been proposed for

several antibodies but is likely to be confounded by disease factors. The suggested relationship between low

exposure and inadequate response may be considered unlikely given that target saturation is anticipated for

most patients at the studied dose level. Disease dependent pharmacokinetics is suggested by the inclusion of

tumour size in the PopPK model as a covariate on clearance. The attempt to avoid confounding by performing

a matched case-control analysis is acknowledged, but can be questioned given the low patient number in

each group. The conclusion from the exposure-response model, that low exposure is the primary reason for

inadequate response, cannot be considered definitive for the time being. Taking into account that a new

dosing strategy is currently under assessment in the ongoing phase III trial further discussion on this issue is

expected at the time of data submission.

Regarding immunogenicity, the overall incidence of TE-ADA was 3.5% (13 of 370) in all evaluable

olaratumab-treated patients and 5.9% (5/85) in STS patients from Study JGDG. Neutralizing antibodies were

detected in all patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-olaratumab antibodies. TE-ADA do

not appear to influence olaratumab clearance and exposure. Data are limited, however there is no indication

that TE-ADA may negatively affect efficacy. Due to the limited number of patients with ADA (or TE-ADA) who

developed IRRs definitive conclusions regarding the relationship between ADA (or TE-ADA) and safety cannot

be established from the 370 evaluable patients 3.5% positive for ADA, all of them positive for neutralizing

antibodies.

Data on very elderly patients (> 75 years) are very limited. However on the basis of data available, no dose

reductions other than those recommended for the general patient population are necessary. (see sections

4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC)
##### **2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology **

The clinical pharmacology of olaratumab is mainly supported by data from studies JGDG, JGDB, JGDD, JGDE,

JGDH, JGDI together with the population pharmacokinetic analysis (including data from Studies JGDG, JGDB,

JGDE, JGDH) and exposure-response (efficacy, safety) analyses. Pharmacokinetics has mainly been

documented in patients with different type of tumours and not in healthy volunteers. There are a number of

limitations in the PK data which should also be addressed in the ongoing confirmatory trial (JGDJ). ***2.5. Clinical efficacy *** **2.5.1. Dose response study(ies) **

JGDC (IMCL CP15-0601) is a phase 1 multicentre open-label dose escalation study of olaratumab single

agent in advanced solid tumours and lymphomas, conducted in 2 US centres between December 2006 and

March 2009. The primary objective was to establish the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 51/115


-----

olaratumab in adult (≥ 18 years) patients with advanced solid tumours no longer responding to standard

therapy or for which no standard therapy was available. The secondary objectives were the evaluation of

pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity of olaratumab.

Patients in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 received olaratumab IV weekly at doses of 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, 16 mg/kg,

respectively, for a total of 4 doses per cycle, followed by a 2-weeks observation period. Patients in Cohorts 4

and 5 received olaratumab IV every two weeks at doses of 15 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively for 4

weeks, for a total of 2 doses per cycle. A minimum of 3 patients were planned to be enrolled in each cohort.

Toxicity data for each cohort was reviewed prior to dose escalation. No intrapatient dose escalation was

allowed.

Twenty (20) patients were enrolled, safety population included 19 subjects and MTD population included 17

patients.

There were no DLTs and the MTD was not determined.

Accrual was closed after 20 patients due to the achievement of serum trough concentrations of Olaratumab

(155 µg/mL) in the weekly 16 mg/kg cohort and q2w 15- and 20 mg/kg cohorts that was associated with

antitumor activity in preclinical models.

No objective responses were observed in the study. Twelve patients across all 5 cohorts had stable disease

(SD) (disease control rate of 63.2%, exact 95% CI: 38.4%, 83.7%), with SD median duration of 3.9 months.

The median PFS was 3.4 months (95% CI 1.5, 5.1).

Simulations were run at doses ranging from 15 to 60 mg/kg at various dosing regimens including Day 1 and

8 of a 21-day cycle. The results of the simulations suggest that with a dosing regimen of 15 mg/kg on Days 1

and 8 of a 21-day cycle, a C min of 240 μg/ml could be attained at steady state, which exceeds the target

minimum trough levels of IMC-3G3 associated with antitumor activity seen in preclinical tumour xenograft

models. Therefore this dosing regimen was selected for the JGDG study.

The phase 1b portion of JGDG study was non-randomized, with all patients assigned to receive olaratumab

and doxorubicin according to the same dose and schedule used in the Investigational Arm in the phase 2

portion of the same study. 15 patients were treated. First patient was enrolled in the Phase 1b in October

2010. After 10 patients received 2 cycles of treatment, Phase 1b was closed to enrolment and the Safety

Review Committee (SRC) reviewed the safety data, then enrolment for Phase 2 started.

The primary objective of phase 1b was to evaluate the safety profile of olaratumab when administered in

combination with doxorubicin to patients with advanced STS. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK

and immunogenicity of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin.

untreated central nervous system metastases (eligible if clinically stable after treatment and off steroids)

***Treatments***

In the Phase 2 portion of the study, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following 2

treatment arms:

  Investigational Arm (Arm A): Olaratumab (15 mg/kg) on Day 1 and Day 8 IV over approximately 60

minutes, plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m²) IV on Day 1 over 15-60 min of each 21-day cycle for up to 8

cycles (Doxorubicin was to be administered 1 hour after the completion of the olaratumab infusion; if

premedication was required prior to the first doxorubicin infusion, this was to be given after the

completion of olaratumab infusion). In the absence of disease progression or other withdrawal

criteria, patients continued to receive subsequent single-agent olaratumab (15 mg/kg) IV on Day 1

and Day 8 of each 21-day cycle, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other reason

for discontinuation.

  - Control Arm (Arm B): Doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles.

Upon documented disease progression on or after completion of single-agent doxorubicin treatment,

patients were allowed to receive olaratumab monotherapy until further disease progression or other

discontinuation criteria were met.

In order to reduce potential doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity, patients receiving more than 4 cycles of

doxorubicin were allowed to receive dexrazoxane at investigator’s discretion on Day 1 of Cycles 5-8 on both

Investigational and Control arms, at a ratio of 10:1 to the administered dose of doxorubicin.

Patients were treated until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or

withdrawal of consent by the patient, or the investigator made the decision to stop treatment.

***Objectives***

The primary objective of the phase 2 portion of the study was to compare the PFS in patients with advanced

STS not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy when treated with olaratumab in combination

with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate and compare the 3-month PFS (PFS-3m), objective response rate

(ORR), change in tumour size from baseline to best overall response, and OS of olaratumab in combination

with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone; and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of

olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin

***Outcomes/endpoints***

**Primary Endpoint:**

To compare PFS in patients with advanced STS not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy when

treated olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone.

PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of documented tumour

progression or death from any cause, whichever was first. Tumour assessment is based on RECIST 1.1

criteria as per Investigator assessment.

**Secondary Endpoints:**

To evaluate and compare overall survival (OS), 3-month PFS (PFS-3m), objective response rate (ORR),

change in tumour size from baseline to best overall response of olaratumab in combination with

doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone;

To evaluate the PK and immunogenicity of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin

OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.

ORR is defined as the proportion of patient achieving a best overall response of complete or partial response

(CR + PR), as per Investigator assessment based on RECIST1.1.

A blinded independent review of radiographic scans has been conducted following the final PFS database lock,

therefore both PFS and ORR according to Independent Review have been presented as secondary analyses.

**Exploratory Endpoints:**

To evaluate the association between tumour PDGFRα expression and clinical outcomes, including PFS,

ORR, etc.

Exploratory objectives in whole blood included, but not were limited to potentially relevant biomarkers of

IMC-3G3 pharmacodynamic activity, including PDGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and

other factors related to PDGFRα. Biomarkers also included, but were not limited to, analysis of tumour

specimens for pericyte coverage, microvessel density, and factors related to PDGFRα. (both phase 1b and

2)

***Sample size***

The Phase 2 portion of the study was designed with a planned enrolment of 130 patients, assuming a 50%

improvement in PFS, or equivalently a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.667 (α = 0.2, with statistical power of

80%). An interim analysis looking at the efficacy data was pre-planned to occur after at least 80 PFS events

had been observed. A very minimal nominal α level of 0.0001 was pre-allocated to the interim analysis. The

final nominal significance level will be adjusted to 0.1999 (two-sided). A protocol amendment (V3) increased

the sample size from 120 to 130 patients, so as to better account for censoring in the analyses of PFS and

OS.

***Randomisation***

Patients enrolled were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to the Investigational or the Control Arm, via an

interactive system (IVRS, accessed by voice or world-wide web) and employed a dynamic-minimization

algorithm according to the following stratification factors:

1) PDGFRα expression (positive vs. negative, IHC assessed)

**Table 11: IVRS randomisation factors (ITT) – Study JGDG**

***Blinding (masking)***

Study JGDG was open-label.

***Statistical methods***

Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed in the ITT population.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median PFS, together with a two-sided 90% confidence

interval (CI). Comparison of PFS between arms was performed using the log-rank test, and hazard ratios

were estimated by a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Only when there were a sufficient number of

patients in each stratum, the stratified analysis was performed. Otherwise, the stratification factors were
#### treated as covariates in the Cox proportional hazards to estimate the HR and 90% confidence limit . 

A re-randomization test was conducted on the ITT population to further evaluate the robustness of the log
rank test results, given the dynamic randomization used.

To show the robustness of primary analysis of PFS, sensitivity analyses were performed using different

censoring/event definition scenarios.

-----

Supportive analysis were also performed: hazard ratios for treatment effect were estimated using a

multivariate Cox model adjusting for baseline factors of interest (randomization stratification factors, ECOG,

CFR, gender, age, duration of disease, platelet, WBC, primary tumour present). A stepwise selection method

was also used, with p-value<0.1 as the criteria for adding a variable and p-value ≥0.15 for dropping a

variable. The treatment group was not included during stepwise selection, but was included in the final

model. HR for the treatment effect along with 95% CI was estimated from the final model.

Overall survival was analysed with the same method used for analyses of the primary endpoint.

The rate of overall response between the treatment groups was compared using the Fisher’s Exact Test. The

objective response rate comparison was also adjusted by the stratification factor by means of a Cochran
Mantel-Haenszel test if there was sufficient number of patients in each stratum. Two-sided 90% exact CI was

determined.

Duration of response was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method; a 90% CI was provided for the median

duration of response.

The maximum change in tumour size was presented using a waterfall plot. The log transformed maximum

change was compared using Analysis of Covariance model, with log transformed baseline tumour size and

randomization stratification factors as covariates.

Statistical analysis plan (SAP) was amended twice and Addenda were added (see table below):

**Table 12: Substantive SAP Amendments and Addenda to Study JGDG**

EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 57/115


-----

In addition, *post hoc* changes to planned statistical analysis were made to after the final PFS database lock:

  The analysis population for efficacy was changed from a randomized and treated population to all

randomized patients (ITT, with the addition of the 4 randomized untreated patients).

  The original protocol and SAP presented 90% CIs for efficacy variables. In anticipation of regulatory

submissions, 95% CIs were judged to be more appropriate and conventional for all efficacy

parameters.

  A blinded independent review of radiologic assessments was conducted.

  Plans for subgroup analyses described per SAP were changed based on a review of literature (see

Section 11.4.3.3.4).

  Subgroups for subgroup analyses are CRF-based unless otherwise noted.

  Additional post hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness and internal

consistency of the overall survival results to any potential impact of baseline and post-baseline

covariates.

  An additional ad hoc exploratory sensitivity analysis was conducted with censoring rules that were the

same as the primary analysis but patients were not censored for death or progression that occurred

after 2 or more missed visits.

***Results***

**Participant flow**

**Recruitment**

Patients were randomized between May 2011 and January 2013.

This study was conducted at 17 investigative sites in the US, of which 16 sites treated patients.

At the data cut-off for OS final analysis (16 May 2015), there were 23 patients being followed for survival in

the Investigational Arm and 8 patients in the Control Arm (the latter including 3 patients who received

olaratumab monotherapy after discontinuation of doxorubicin).

**Ancillary analyses**

- PDGFRα status

PDGFRα expression assessed by IHC was used for patient stratification to ensure both arms had equal

representation of PDGFR-α expressing tumours. The IHC assay used for stratification (Assay 1) reported

approximately 88% of evaluable cases positive for PDGFRα. However, after the trial was enrolled, further

investigation into PDGFRα Assay 1 revealed that although the antibody used for stratification was quite

sensitive for PDGFR-α, it had relatively poor specificity since it also recognized the β form of PDGFR. So, in

the context of exploratory biomarker work to investigate PDGFRα and related ligands, an alternative PDGFRα

IHC (Assay 2) was developed using a commercially available antibody highly sensitive and specific for

PDGFRα.

Progression-free survival from the translational research (TR) population (that is, those patients with PDGFRα

status determined by Assay 2 available) is shown in the table below.

**Table 22: Progression-Free Survival by IHC PDGFRα Status and Treatment arms - Study JGDG TR Population**

Data cut-off date: 15 August 2014.
a Sensitivity Analysis 1: If new anticancer treatment started before progression, the patient was considered to have disease
progression at the date of the new cancer treatment; if death or progression occurred after 2 or more missed visits, the date of
death or progression was used; and if lost to follow-up without progression, the patient was considered to have disease
progression at the date of the last adequate assessment.
b Sensitivity Analysis 2: Used the actual reported date of progression or death regardless of missing assessments, treatment
discontinuation or new anticancer treatment.
c Sensitivity Analysis 3: Added clinical progression (symptomatic deteriorations) as progressive events to the primary analysis.
d Ad Hoc Sensitivity Analysis 4: Censoring rules were the same as the primary analysis but patients were not censored if death or

progression occurred after 2 or more missed visits .

OS sensitivity analyses

In order to assess the impact of baseline characteristics on efficacy, a stratified Cox multivariate model of OS

was performed, adjusted for specific factors considered potentially prognostic for OS on the basis of the

literature and initial investigations of data from Study JGDG:

- liver metastases (presence at baseline vs. absence at baseline)

- ECOG PS (0 vs. 1 vs. 2)

- sex (females vs. males)

- age (< 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years)

- weight (above and below median weight)

- duration of disease since diagnosis (above and below median duration of disease)

- grade at diagnosis (1 vs. 2 vs. 3)

- albumin level (above and below median albumin level).

The OS HR for the treatment effect was 0.429 (95% CI: 0.267, 0.690), consistent with the stratified

univariate OS HR of 0.463 observed in the main analysis.

Sensitivity analyses for OS were performed based on censoring at the date of starting new anticancer

treatment.

OS (from the time of randomization) was similar among those patients on the Control Arm patients who

received olaratumab monotherapy subsequent to discontinuation of doxorubicin and those patients who did

not. The OS HR was 1.013 (p=.9660), indicating no evidence of a statistical difference in OS between these

populations and underscoring that the use of olaratumab in the Control Arm did not adversely affect OS.

##### **2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy **

The current request for conditional marketing approval is based on a single open-label, randomized phase

1b/2 trial (study JGDG). It enrolled doxorubicin-naïve subjects with advanced STS not amenable to treatment

with surgery or radiotherapy.

***Design and conduct of clinical studies***

The unblinded 1:1 randomized study was properly designed to reflect the universe of advanced STS facing

palliative treatment with inclusion of a broad range of histotypes and an upper limit PS of 2 that reflects the

real-life status of most individuals. It is to the credit of the trial's design that doxorubicin was chosen as the

only treatment in the standard-arm, avoiding investigator-chosen schemes, even at the expense of

recruitment rate. Maintenance of single-agent olaratumab was allowed in the experimental arm, while

crossover to single-agent olaratumab was permitted in control arm upon progression.

PFS is considered an appropriate endpoint. The study was designed with a planned enrolment of 130

patients, assuming a 50% improvement in PFS, which is an ambitious target given the lack of significant

improvement in the first-line treatment of STS for decades. Stratification took into account relevant data for

the population included in the trial, even though the actual stratifications factors used when it comes to

analysing the PFS were limited to number of lines of previous therapy (0 versus >0) and disease histology

(LMS versus non-LMS).

***Efficacy data and additional analyses***

Baseline characteristics reflected those to be expected in the intended patient population to be treated with

olaratumab. Histologies varied widely but over 60% of the cases were among the common subtypes of L
sarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. As expected early in the disease history, most subjects

remained quite symptom-free (PS 0-1) in spite of significant numbers of grade 3 events (> 40%) with

widespread disease not only to the lungs (around 60%), but also liver, soft-tissue and lymph nodes (over one

third of the cases each).

Trial results were positive and they seem compelling from the clinical point of view. Treatment with

olaratumab on top of doxorubicin nearly doubled PFS (8.2 vs 4.5 months; according to the IRC; 6.6 vs. 4.1

months, HR 0.672 [95% CI: 0.442, 1.021], p = 0.0615 according to investigator assessment). The

improvement in OS was even more important. Olaratumab reduced the risk of death by 53.7% (HR = 0.463;

p=0.0003), representing 80% longer median survival in the investigational arm (26.5 months vs.

14.7 months). In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves showed an unusual early separation and a persistence of the

OS benefit over time. Although JGDG was a relatively small phase 1b/2 exploratory trial, the efficacy results

observed, if confirmed within the context of the ongoing phase 3 trial JGDJ, represent a potential paradigm
shift in the treatment of advanced STS.

After adjusting for factors most likely to affect prognosis, olaratumab maintained its effect in the two groups

of LMS and non-LMS. However, due to the high number of different sarcoma subtypes, the absence of a clear

pattern according to the histology is not unexpected. It is not possible to exclude that the wide histological

heterogeneity of the study could potentially have impacted on the overall survival results. However, the

numbers are too small to make any sound conclusion.

-----

Further analyses according to tumour load at baseline and baseline characteristics were provided during the

procedure and did not show important discrepancies regarding the main results in terms of HR for both PFS

and OS.

The Applicant was requested to evaluate the impact of the observed higher rate of early interruption of

treatment for reason other than radiographically documented PD or death in the Control arm compared to the

Investigational arm (50.7% vs 15.6%). Despite an improvement in the absolute median OS in the Control

arm compared to the primary analysis (16.1 vs 14.7 months), suggesting that early interruption in the

Control arm was related to a worse prognosis, the magnitude of benefit was maintained compared to the

primary analyses (unstratified HRs 0.558 vs 0.517).

Post-study treatments varied between treatment arms, but none of the used regimens have been shown to

increase the overall survival of patients. Moreover, two OS sensitivity analysis ruled out any eventual

influence of post-study treatment on the primary OS analysis. In addition, post-hoc sensitivity analyses were

performed to consider the impact of the number of cycles of therapy on OS. No discrepancies were found.

Potential baseline imbalances were also explored. A stratified Cox multivariate model of OS was performed,

adjusted for specific factors considered potentially prognostic for OS on the basis of the literature. The OS HR

for the treatment effect was 0.429 (95% CI: 0.267, 0.690), consistent with the stratified univariate OS HR

of 0.463 observed in the main analysis. Further analyses according to tumour load at baseline and baseline

characteristics, did not show important discrepancies regarding the main results in terms of HR for both PFS

and OS.

The survival censoring is not considered informative, given that the vast majority are due to patients still

alive. In addition, subgroups analyses do not reveal any signal of data driven by any subgroup.

The discrepancy between the PFS results and the outstanding survival outcome, could be also related to a

major post-progression and off therapy effect. This possibility warrants further analyses with different

approaches based on biomarkers and PFS2 results. Unfortunately, the Applicant was not able to provide the

results of the exploratory biomarker analyses planned in the phase 2 study nor PFS2 data. Biomarker

analyses and PFS2 are planned in the ongoing phase 3 JGDJ study, which could shed some light on that (See

Annex II).

PDGFRα expression did not have any predictive value on response. Two IHC were sequentially used for

PDGFRα expression studies. The first one was flawed with poor specificity and cross-reaction with irrelevant

but similar receptors. A more precise assay was developed but equally failed to segregate responders from

non-responders. The role of PDGFRα will be clarified in the confirmatory phase III trial, as it could have a

profound impact on the clinical use of the drug and on its definitive regulatory status.

As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity. Overall, a low incidence of both

treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies were detected in clinical trial samples.

***Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA***

The survival advantage seen with olaratumab is not associated with a delay in tumour progression. Potential

differences in some baseline characteristics (although the limited number of patients cannot allow drawing

conclusions), the different histological subtypes included within the study and a (likely) off therapy effect

could partly explain these results. These hypotheses require confirmation.

Because of the limited sample size, it is unlikely that further answers may be extrapolated from the phase

1b/2 study supporting this application, particularly in terms of subgroup analyses. Only the Phase 3 JGDJ

study will provide further clarification regarding the obtained and the missing data. It is reassuring that the

enrolment of the phase 3 study is almost completed (as of 20 July 2016, the number of patients randomised

is 505. Pre-planned enrolment was 460, with all sites closed to screening except in Japan and Taiwan to meet

local regulatory requirements). Therefore, it is considered that recruitment won’t be jeopardized by the time

of EU launch, and the Applicant will likely be in a position to provide the results from the phase 3 study.
##### **2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy **

According to the data from the phase II study JGDG, the use of combination of olaratumab and doxorubicin

has shown an unexpected but clinically meaningful increase in OS in comparison to doxorubicin single agent

(HR 0.463, 95% CI: 0.301- 0.710, p=0.0003; median gain of 11.8 months). This result seems to be reliable

as supported by several sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, this gain in life expectancy is not explained by the

antitumor activity of the combination and PFS and ORR data do not show the same level of efficacy. A phase

III randomized double-blind confirmatory study (JGDJ) is currently ongoing. Taking into account the high

clinical relevance of the OS results obtained in a rare disease with limited effective treatment options and

poor long-term survival, a conditional MA can be considered.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context of

a conditional MA:

In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of olaratumab in the treatment of patients with advanced

soft tissue sarcoma, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study JGDJ comparing

doxorubicin plus olaratumab versus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic STS (including

exploratory biomarker data) by 31 January 2020. ***2.6. Clinical safety ***

***Patient exposure***

A total of 485 patients have received olaratumab in 9 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. The safety profile of

olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of patients with advanced STS is principally

derived from the Phase 2 portion of Study JGDG (n= 129, 64 patients in the investigational arm and 65

patients in the comparator arm).

Notable AEs

Notable patients were defined as those patients who met 1 or more of the following criteria: Discontinued

study treatment due to any AE; Experienced death while on any study treatment or within 30 days of last

study dose; Experienced suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions; Discontinued any study treatment

due to reasons other than AE or progressive disease (PD); Discontinued the study due to lost to follow-up;

Experienced AESIs.

*Gastrointestinal Disorders*

It was observed that, in the Investigational Arm compared with the Control Arm, a higher incidence of

nausea (47 [73.4%] vs. 34 [52.3%]), *mucositis* (34 [53.1%] vs. 23 [35.4%]), vomiting (29 [45.3%] vs. 12

[18.5%]), and diarrhea (22 [34.4%] vs. 15 [23.1%]) were observed. These events are generally considered

toxicities associated with doxorubicin; they were monitorable and manageable, predominantly Grade ≤2, and

did not lead to a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation.

*Neutropenia/Febrile Neutropenia/Infection*

In the Phase 2 portion of Study JGDG, the incidence of any-grade neutropenia (consolidated term) was

higher in the Investigational Arm than in the Control Arm (38 [59.4%] vs. 25 [38.5%], respectively). The

incidence of Grade 3 neutropenia was also higher in the Investigational Arm compared with the Control Arm

(12 [18.8%] vs. 5 [7.7%], respectively); a higher rate was also observed in the Investigational Arm with

Grade ≥4 neutropenia (23 [35.9%] vs. 17 [26.2%], respectively).

As with the AE reports, the laboratory results also demonstrate a similar trend in that there was a higher rate

of decreased neutrophils shifts from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 while on study observed in the

Investigational Arm than in the Control Arm.

In order to assess any potential association of neutropenia with infectious complications, an additional

analysis was performed. The rate of severe infection was similar between the treatment arms. Despite the

higher rate of neutropenia in the Investigational Arm versus the Control Arm, the combination of olaratumab

and doxorubicin did not result in an increased incidence of febrile neutropenia (12.5% in the olaratumab plus

doxorubicin arm and 13.8 % in the doxorubicin alone arm) or infections. In addition, no increase in the

number of treatment discontinuations or deaths was observed in the Investigational Arm as a consequence of

The use of G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia was higher in the Investigational Arm 35 [(54.7%])

compared with the Control Arm (24 [36.9%]), consistent with the higher incidence of neutropenia on the

Investigational Arm.

*Anaemia*

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 83/115


-----

The incidence of anaemia was similar in both treatment arms (26 [40.6%] in the Investigational Arm vs. 24

[36.9%] in the Control Arm) and consisted mainly of Grade 1 and 2 events. There were not differences

between the treatment arms in the rate of shifts in low haemoglobin while on study. There were no Grade 4

anaemia events by laboratory assessment.

Transfusions were the most frequent procedures performed on both treatment arms, primarily red blood cell

transfusions for the treatment of anaemia, and its use was similar between treatment arms (17.2%

[Investigational Arm] vs. 13.8% [Control Arm]).

*Thrombocytopenia*

The incidence of thrombocytopenia was similar in both arms (16 [25.0%] in the Investigational Arm vs. 14

[21.5%] in the Control Arm) and consisted mainly of Grade 1 and 2 events (Grade ≥4 events were also

evenly distributed between both treatment arms: 2 [3.1%] in each arm).

There was no difference between the treatment arms in the rate of shifts in low platelets while on study. One

patient (1.5%) on the Control Arm received platelet transfusion for the treatment of thrombocytopenia.

*Musculoskeletal Pain*

In Study JGDG, an imbalance was seen between the Investigational Arm and Control Arm in the SOC of

Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders and also in individual PTs within this SOC. This includes AEs

pertaining to pain in relation to various anatomical structures such as muscles, joints, and bone.

The incidence of musculoskeletal pain (any grade) was higher in the Investigational Arm (41 [64.1%]) as

compared to the Control Arm (16 [24.6%]). The majority of these events were Grade 1 or 2. The incidence of

Grade ≥3 musculoskeletal pain was higher in the Investigational Arm (5 [7.8%]) as compared to the Control

Arm (1 [1.5%]). In the majority of patients the pain was related to the patients’ underlying cancer or

metastases or pre-existing or concomitant conditions. The majority of these events occurred in the first 4

cycles. The pain can last from few days to up to 200 days. In some patients there was a recurrence of pain

.The pain did not worsen with time or during recurrence. Moreover, the majority of Grade 2-3 events

*Pain in Extremity*

Pain in extremity (any grade) was reported as a TEAE in 15 patients (23.4%) in the Investigational Arm

versus 1 patient (1.5%) in the Control Arm. Grade **≥** 3 events of pain in extremity were reported in 2 patients

A total of 8 of 15 (53%) patients in the Investigational Arm and 1 of 1 (100%) patient in the Control Arm had

the AE pain in extremity assessed by the Sponsor as related to underlying tumour or metastases. Of the

remaining 7 patients in the Investigational Arm, pain in extremity was assessed as related to an AE for 4

patients (cellulitis [n=1], deep vein thrombosis [DVT] of leg [n=1], peripheral neuropathy [n=1], and

generalized muscle pain and muscle spasms [n=1]). For 3 patients, further information was not available,

and the Sponsor assessed these as possibly drug related. Most AEs were Grade 1 or 2.

IRRs were reported in 12.5 % of patients. The majority of IRRs occurred during or following the first

olaratumab infusion. Symptoms of IRRs included flushing, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills,

and in some cases manifested as severe hypotension, anaphylactic shock, or fatal cardiac arrest. Severe

IRRs, also including a fatal case were reported in 3.1 % of patients and mainly presented with shortness of

breath, loss of consciousness and hypotension. All severe IRRs occurred during or immediately after the first

administration of olaratumab (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

Medical intervention employed to manage *IRRs* included: infusion rate decreased in 21 (30.0%) patients,

infusion interruption in 49 (70.0%) patients, antihistamines in 43 (61.7%) patients, corticosteroids in 26

(37.1%) patients, and other treatment in 29 (41.4%) patients.

Patients with a Grade ≥3 *IRR* s were immediately and permanently discontinued from olaratumab, in

accordance with study protocols. In the 11 patients with Grade ≥3 *IRRs* due to olaratumab, 9 were treated

with antihistamines, 8 were treated with corticosteroids, and 10 received additional/other treatment.

Overall, across all studies (n=485), among the 70 patients who had an initial *IRR* grade 1 and 2 due to

olaratumab, 59 (84.3%) were rechallenged and 12 (20.3%) of those patients had another *IRRs* (either Grade

1 or 2 in severity).

*Cardiac Arrhythmias*

In Study JGDG (randomized Phase 2 portion), the rate of cardiac arrhythmias was similar in both arms (15.6

% in the Investigational Arm and 15.4 % in the Control Arm); the majority of these events were Grade 1-2

events of bradycardia or tachycardia. There were no AEs of serious (Grade ≥3) arrhythmia in the

Investigational Arm.

*Cardiac Dysfunction*

In Study JGDG (randomized Phase 2 portion), following medical review of the data the overall incidence of

cardiac dysfunction was considered to be similar between the 2 treatments arms. The majority of the events

were Grade 1 and 2, with ejection fraction decreased reported most frequently. These findings are in the

context of higher cumulative doxorubicin drug exposure in the Investigational Arm compared to the Control

Arm.

-----

An analysis of the peripheral oedema events has been conducted. The Applicant stated that peripheral

oedema can be caused by a number of factors in this population, such as immobility, DVT, renal insufficiency,

hepatic dysfunction due to tumour metastases, underlying tumour causing lymphatic or venous obstruction,

or hypoalbuminemia. This analysis included reviewing cardiac function assessments (ECHO/MUGA scans) and

specifically looking at any additional AEs within the cardiac failure SMQ. Ten patients in the Investigational

Arm and 7 patients in the Control Arm experienced peripheral oedema. None of the reported AEs suggested

cardiac dysfunction or a significant deterioration in left ventricular function, except for one patient in the

Control Arm in whom peripheral oedema was associated with a fall in LVEF (35%, baseline was 65%) but

oedema was considered likely multifactorial.

Haemorrhagic events

During the procedure, the applicant was requested to examine all the haemorrhagic events across the

development programme of olaratumab. The majority of haemorrhagic AEs reported were considered

unrelated to study drugs and they were mainly G1-2. Haemorrhagic events considered by investigator as

related to any study drug were reported in 14/294 (4.8%) patients treated with olaratumab in association

with chemotherapy, in 3/96 (3.1%) patients in the monotherapy studies, and in 0/95 patients treated with

olaratumab monotherapy at crossover. Among them, there were three Grade ≥3 events: two (one fatal ICH

and one GI haemorrhage G4) in the combination studies, both having plausible confounding factors. One

event (an intrahepatic bleeding due to tumour rupture) was reported in the monotherapy studies, for which

the causal relation with olaratumab could not be excluded.

Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)

The Applicant used the following analytical criteria to conduct an initial screen of the AE data in Study JGDG

(randomized Phase 2 portion), where “incidence” is the percentage of patients experiencing the event. Events

meeting either of these criteria in Study JGDG were evaluated as potential ADRs for olaratumab:

- The two-sided p-value is <0.10 (with the incidence higher in the Investigational Arm than in the Control

Arm) and the risk ratio is >1 (Investigational Arm vs. Control Arm).

- The two-sided p-value is ≥0.10 (comparing the Investigational Arm with the Control Arm), the olaratumab

plus doxorubicin incidence is ≥1% (not rounded up), the risk ratio is ≥2 (Investigational Arm vs. Control

Arm), and the absolute count among olaratumab-treated patients is at least 4.

- The incidence in the Investigational Arm is ≥10% (not rounded up) and the risk ratio is ≥1 (Investigational

Arm vs. Control Arm).

The table resulting from this analysis is reported below:

**Sarcoma (Phase 2)**

Supportive safety evaluations of 94 patients treated with olaratumab monotherapy within the nonrandomized

single-agent Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies (Studies JGDC, JGDF, JGDE [olaratumab arm only], and JGDH)

have been provided. Overall, more frequently reported TEAEs related to olaratumab across these four studies

where fatigue, IRRs, rash, proteinuria, hypertension, nausea. Grade 3 TEAEs related to olaratumab reported

were (1 patient each): lymphopenia, hypertension, AST increase, abnormal hepatic function, syncope.

Lymphopenia has been recorded. No Neutropenia events were reported with olaratumab monotherapy, which

was the most frequent event in the combination olaratumab + doxorubicin instead. Neutropenia does not

appear to be an AE typically associated to olaratumab.

In JGDF study (phase I, advanced cancer, Japan only), a Grade 3 tumour haemorrhage related to olaratumab

has been reported as treatment emergent-SAE. In JGDC study (phase I, advanced cancer) a Grade 2 tumour

haemorrhage has been reported as treatment emergent-SAE, for which the Applicant stated that the tumour

haemorrhage occurred the same day as when image revealed new liver lesions demonstrating PD. In study

Assessment report

-----

JGDE (phase II, olaratumab vs ramucirumab, glioblastoma), a Grade 2 intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) has

been reported as treatment emergent-SAE. A possible relationship between the event of ICH and study drug

cannot be excluded, based on the possibility that haemorrhage into an area of tumour necrosis occurred;

however, the patient was also receiving aspirin and enoxaparin, which may confound the association. In

addition, the underlying disease in this patient population could represent a confounding factor for the event

of ICH.

Further, across the three studies JGDA, JGDB and JGDD, a total of 65 patients received olaratumab

monotherapy in the Control Arms after discontinuation of respective chemotherapy. Overall, the most

common drug-related TEAE reported in this population were gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting,

constipation, stomatitis), fatigue, IRR, nervous system disorders (dizziness, peripheral neuropathy,

headache), musculoskeletal disorder, anaemia.

Supportive safety evaluations of 191 patients treated with olaratumab + chemotherapy (other than

doxorubicin) in the randomized Phase 2 studies (Studies JGDA, JGDB, JGDD) in non-STS tumour type have

been provided. Overall, the most common TEAE reported (regardless the causality) in the combination arms

of these three studies were fatigue, nausea, constipation, neuropathy, alopecia, neutropenia, anemia. One

case of grade 3 gastrointestinal haemorrhage has been reported in JGDB study (phase 2, NSCLC 1° line,

carboplatin + paclitaxel + olaratumab). Per investigator, acetylsalicylic acid and chronic steroid use were

potential causes of the events, however carboplatin, paclitaxel, and olaratumab also could not be ruled out as

possible contributors. No tumour haemorrhage has been reported in the JGDG study. In JGDG Study, 3 cases

of grade 3 gastrointestinal haemorrhages and one case of grade 3 hepatic haemorrhage were recorded;

however all these events were considered not related to olaratumab.

A total of 10 deaths occurred during study therapy or within 30 days after the last dose of study therapy, 3 in

the Investigational Arm and 7 in the Control Arm. In the Investigational Arm, all the 3 deaths reported were

related to disease progression. In the Control Arm, among the 7 deaths reported, 2 were considered due to

disease progression. The other 5 deaths were considered related to AEs, including 2 doxorubicin-related

(sepsis and septic shock). Cardiac arrest occurred in a patient in the Control Arm who crossover to

Olaratumab.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 93/115


-----

In the phase 1b portion of JGDG, there was one death due to AE, which was considered not related to any

study drug by investigator. The Applicant agrees with the investigator’s opinion that the cause of death was

not known.

In the additional phase 2 randomized studies in other solid tumours (JGDA, JGDB, and JGDD), the following

deaths possibly related to olaratumab were reported: in the Investigational Arm of JGDA study, one patient

(1.6%) died due to AE (intracranial haemorrhage, ICH) >30 days after last dose of study therapy and was

assessed as possibly related to olaratumab. The AE of ICH was confounded by recent history of head trauma,

and the Applicant’s assessment of relationship of the event with olaratumab is indeterminate. In the

Investigational arm of JGDB study, one patient died on C1D8 (8 days after

carboplatin/paclitaxel/olaratumab), cause of death were related to underlying NSCLC, septic shock secondary

to pneumonia and febrile neutropenia. The AE of febrile neutropenia and sepsis were considered related to

carboplatin, paclitaxel and olaratumab. In JGDD study, one patient in the control arm who received

olaratumab monotherapy after progression, died due to cardiac arrest seven days after the last dose of

olaratumab. The Applicant agrees with the investigator for the cause of death, cardiac arrest, being related to

disease progression and concomitant overall deterioration, but also recognizes a possible role of

pyelonephritis and bronchopneumonia.

In the supportive studies with olaratumab monotherapy, no deaths related to olaratumab were reported.

***Laboratory findings***

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 94/115


-----

***Immunological events***

Of the 109 patients exposed to olaratumab, 85 patients were considered evaluable for the presence/absence

of ADA. Treatment-emergent ADA were identified in 5 (5.9%) of the 85 evaluable patients, with titers

ranging from 1:40 to 1:80. All 5 treatment-emergent ADA-positive subjects also had detectable neutralizing

antibodies. All *IRRs* (n=2) associated with treatment-emergent ADA were Grade 2 and did not lead to

treatment discontinuation.

The treatment-emergent ADA data from the 8 supportive studies are consistent with the data from Study

JGDG.

***Safety in special populations***

Additional analyses summarizing TEAEs by subgroups, including histology (LMS, non-LMS), age (<65, ≥65,

≥65 to <75, ≥75 to <85, and ≥85 years), sex (male, female), and race (White, Non-White), were

performed.

                    Histology (Leiomyosarcoma vs. Non Leiomyosarcoma)

The safety profile of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin was consistent across LMS and non-LMS

(other) disease histology, and with that of the overall study population. Given the small number of patients

within the other STS subtype populations, comparative safety analyses within this group could not be

performed.

Age

Overall, the rate of AEs in terms of SOC and individual PT for the 65-74 years and 74-84 years age groups

was similar to that of the <65 years age group. Of note, there was only 1 patient in the Phase 2 portion of

Study JGDG age >85 years; this patient is not included in the subgroup analyses shown in Table 33 and

Table 34.

There was a trend for a higher rate of AEs in both the 65-74 years and 74-84 years age groups as compared

to the <65 years age group for the haematological toxicities (SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders

and individual PTs). However, this trend was seen in both the investigational and the control arms, indicating

possible susceptibility of the elderly population to the bone marrow suppressive effects of doxorubicin.

Sex

The incidences of TEAEs of any grade were similar in both sexes and between the 2 treatment arms. Overall,

females experienced higher rates of Grade ≥3 TEAEs (32 [84.2%] in the Investigational Arm vs. 24 [72.7%]

in the Control Arm) in comparison to males (19 [73.1%] in the Investigational Arm vs. 21 [65.6%] in the

Control Arm), but the magnitude of difference was similar between both treatment arms.

The most frequently reported TEAEs (regardless of causality, any grade) for patients in the Investigational

Arm, in males versus females, respectively, were musculoskeletal pain (19 [73.1%] vs. 22 [57.9%]), nausea

(15 [57.7%] vs. 32 [84.2%]), fatigue (18 [69.2%] vs. 26 [68.4%]), neutropenia (15 [57.7%] vs. 23

[60.5%]), and mucositis (14 [53.8%] vs. 20 [52.6%]).

Grade ≥3 TEAEs for male patients observed at higher (>5% point difference) incidence in the Investigational

Arm than in the Control Arm, respectively, were neutropenia (14 [53.8%] vs. 11 [34.4%]), musculoskeletal

pain (3 [11.5%] vs. 0), and lymphopenia (3 [11.5%] vs. 1 [3.1%]).

Grade ≥3 TEAEs for female patients observed at higher (>5% point difference) incidence in the

Investigational Arm than in the Control Arm, respectively, were fatigue (4 [10.5%] vs. 0), neutropenia (21

[55.3%] vs. 11 [33.3%]), thrombocytopenia (6 [15.8%] vs. 0), anemia (8 [21.1%] vs. 4 [12.1%]), and

abdominal pain, hyponatremia, and lymphopenia (each, 2 [5.3%] vs. 0).

Race

The safety population for the subgroup analysis of race consisted of 86.8% White patients and 13.2% Non
White. Overall, the incidence of TEAEs of any grade was similar in both race groups (White and Non-White)

and in the 2 treatment arms. White patients experienced a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 TEAEs in

comparison to Non-White patients, but the incidence of SAEs was similar between both groups.

***Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions***

Apart from Study JGDI that was conducted to assess the potential for DDI between olaratumab and

doxorubicin in STS, no additional studies were conducted (see clinical pharmacology).

***Discontinuation due to adverse events***

Summary tables of AE leading to dose modification are presented below:

**Table 49: Olaratumab dose modifications (Safety population, JGDG phase 2)**

The majority of Olaratumab dose modifications (including dose delays, dose reduction, dose held and infusion

rate modification) occurred as a result of AEs. The most common (in >5% of patients) AEs leading to

modification of olaratumab (regardless of relationship to study therapy) were neutropenia (31 [48.4%]),

thrombocytopenia (8 [12.5%]), febrile neutropenia and IRR (both 4 [6.3%]).

**Table 50: Doxorubicin dose modifications (Safety population, JGDG phase 2)**

The majority of modifications occurred as a result of AEs (patients with AE leading to modification of

doxorubicin: 23 pts [35.9%] vs. 17 pts [26.2%] in the Investigational vs the Control group respectively). The

most common (in >5% of patients in either arm) AEs leading to modification of doxorubicin were neutropenia

(13 [20.3%] vs. 6 [9.2%] in the Investigational vs. the Control Arm) and febrile neutropenia (3 [4.7%] vs. 4

[6.2%]).

A summary table of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation are presented below:

In the Investigational Arm, all events were considered related to any study drug, with the exception of

“respiratory failure”. In the Control Arm, the events considered unrelated to doxorubicin according to

Investigator were Ejection fraction decreased (1 out of 4 events), respiratory failure, procedural pain,

phantom pain, intestinal obstruction (leading to death). The other TEAEs leading to discontinuation listed in

the table above were considered related to study drugs according to Investigator.

In the Crossover population (30 pts) of the Control Arm, there were 5 patients (16.7%) experiencing a total

of 10 AEs leading to modification of olaratumab (vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, hyperbilirubinemia,

gastroenteritis, influenza, weight decreased, tumour pain, acute renal failure, and flushing). Two patients

(6.7%) discontinued olaratumab due to AE, one for IRR G4 related to olaratumab, and one for

musculoskeletal pain Grade 3 (pain in extremity and back pain, unrelated to study drug according to

investigator).

***Post marketing experience***

N/A
##### **2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety **

A total of 485 patients have received olaratumab in 9 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. For the purpose of this

application, the safety profile of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of patients

with advanced STS is mainly based on safety results from the Phase 2 portion of Study JGDG (main

registration study). The safety data from this study included the analysis of treatment-emergent adverse

events, adverse events of special interest and notable patients (those with at least one of the following:

Discontinued study treatment due to any AE, experienced death while on any study treatment or within 30

days of last study dose, experienced suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, discontinued any study

treatment due to reasons other than AE or P, discontinued the study due to lost to follow-up or experienced

AESIs).

Study JGDG was an early/phase exploratory trial and the overall exposure to the investigational treatment

could be considered relatively low. The size of the safety dataset is considered small, and data on long-term

use limited. During the procedure, the applicant provided a safety update report also provided to FDA,

including 47 patients treated across 4 studies at the data cut-off of 20 January 2016 and the report together

with the blinded safety data of the first interim safety analysis conducted by the independent Data Monitoring

Committee (iDCM) for the ongoing phase 3 study JGDJ at the data cut-off of 19 February 2016, including 157

patients (of whom 100 treated with >2 cycles). The number of patients included in these two new safety

reports was small and patients were heterogeneous (i.e. indication, dosage, country) and the interpretability

of blinded data provided was quite limited. However, the supplementary data provided did not highlight any

unknown safety finding.

A total of 64 patients were treated with the combination of doxorubicin and olaratumab and 30 patients in

the control arm received olaratumab monotherapy after progression with doxorubicin. Those patients,

although small in numbers, were exposed to a significant number of cycles (median 16.5 infusions in the

doxorubicin + olaratumab arm and 4 as monotherapy in the control arm).

Known toxicities reported for doxorubicin, observed in the combination of olaratumab and doxorubicin include

fatigue, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and alopecia. The added toxicity of olaratumab to doxorubicin is not

trivial, given the remarkable increase in doxorubicin dose reductions. This finding suggests that the toxicity of

the combination, although manageable, seems to be significant.

The frequency of certain AEs typically associated with doxorubicin was increased when using the combination

with olaratumab indicating that olaratumab is not devoid from toxicity. This is noted especially for nausea

(increased by a factor of 3), neutropenia (an absolute 20% higher), anaemia and thrombocytopenia (both of

them raised above the 10% bar). This fact is probably reflecting the greater exposure to doxorubicin in the

-----

experimental arm; however, the median duration for all of them (with the exception of diarrhoea) was no

longer in the combination than in the monotherapy group.

The higher incidence of neutropenia in the investigational arm was not associated with a higher risk for

infectious complications. However, the neutrophil count should be checked prior to olaratumab dosing on Day

1 and Day 8 of each cycle and neutrophil counts should be monitored during the treatment with olaratumab

and doxorubicin and supportive care administered such as antibiotics or G-CSF as per local guidelines (see

section 4.4 of the SmPC).

Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by chemotherapeutic

agents including doxorubicin, may result in serious or fatal infections. Vaccination with a live vaccine should

be avoided in patients receiving olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

The higher incidence of painful events is also intriguing. They were diverse, in nature and anatomic location,

and frequent (around 60% vs. 20% in control arm, 7.8% vs. 1.5% for Grade 3). Pain erodes quality of life

more than many other side effects and it is a concern in the case of a palliative treatment where preserving

the quality of life is paramount. A description of Musculoskeletal Pain, with severity and duration, has been

reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Although the higher frequency of painful events in the combination arm

is not completely understood, it seems that they are limited to the first 4-5 cycles of treatment.

An analysis of all 16 patients with pain in extremity as an AE showed that most of them were disease
dependant. Moreover, by analysing the narratives of these patients, most of the cases of pain in extremities

could have non-drug related explanation. However, no drug related events were reported in the Control arm.

Pain in extremities is included in the “musculoskeletal pain” term and it is reflected in the SmPC.

The brief summary of safety data from the olaratumab monotherapy treatment did not show any additional

safety concerns. However, the applicant was asked to discuss the relationship between haemorrhagic AEs

and olaratumab observed across supportive studies, taking into account the clinical relevance of such events.

The analysis of these haemorrhagic AEs revealed that the majority of them were considered unrelated to

study drugs and they were mainly Grade 1-2. Nevertheless, plausibility of haemorrhagic events when

targeting PDGFRα in patients cannot be ruled out, considering the current lack of biological data clarifying the

mechanism of action of olaratumab. Based on the data provided, an increased risk of haemorrhagic events is

observed across olaratumab studies. Platelet counts should be checked prior to olaratumab dosing on Day 1

and Day 8 of each cycle. Coagulation parameters should be monitored in patients with conditions

predisposing to bleeding, such as anticoagulant use. In a study of olaratumab in combination with liposomal

doxorubicin, there was one case of fatal intracranial haemorrhage in a patient who had experienced a fall

while on treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

The Applicant identified 3 AEs of special interest (AESIs) for olaratumab and/or doxorubicin: infusion-related

reactions (IRR), cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction.

IRRs, including anaphylactic reactions, were reported in clinical trials with olaratumab. The majority of these

reactions occurred during or following the first olaratumab infusion. Symptoms of IRRs included flushing,

shortness of breath, bronchospasm, or fever/chills, and in some cases manifested as severe hypotension,

anaphylactic shock, or fatal cardiac arrest. Severe IRRs such as anaphylactic reactions can occur despite the

use of premedication. Patients should be monitored during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRRs in a

setting with available resuscitation equipment. For management and dose adjustments in patients who

experience Grade 1 or 2 IRR during the infusion, see section 4.2. In patients who have experienced a

previous Grade 1 or 2 IRR, premedication with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (intravenously), paracetamol,

-----

and dexamethasone is recommended. Olaratumab should be immediately and permanently discontinued in

patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 IRR (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

The addition of olaratumab did not seem to increase the frequency or severity of cardiac arrhythmia.

However AEs of cardiac dysfunction were slightly more frequent in the investigational arm. This finding has to

be put into the context of a higher doxorubicin exposure of these patients, compared to the control arm.

SAEs (any grade and Grade ≥3) were slightly more frequently reported in the investigational arm, than in the

doxorubicin or olaratumab monotherapy arms. This was also the case for pain-related events, such as

musculoskeletal and abdominal pain.

The rates of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were comparable between both treatment arms, which

provide reassurance.

It is noted that olaratumab doses were more prone to delays or reductions when combined with

chemotherapy than when administered as monotherapy suggesting better tolerance to the monotherapy (the

main reason for dose modifications being AEs).

A total of 10 deaths occurred during study therapy or within 30 days after the last dose, 5 due to AEs and 5

due to PD. One death occurred in a patient in the Control Arm who crossed over to olaratumab due to a

cardiac arrest associated to olaratumab IRR in the context of an extensive cardiac history and prior

doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The risk of cardiac toxicity rises with increasing cumulative doses of

anthracyclines, including doxorubicin and is higher in individuals with a history of cardiomyopathy,

mediastinal irradiation or pre-existing cardiac disease. There are no data for the combination of olaratumab

and doxorubicin in anthracycline pre-treated patients, including pre-treatment with doxorubicin. In order to

minimise doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity, the use of appropriate cardio-protective measures (LVEF

measurement, such as ECHO or MUGA scan, ECG monitoring, and/or use of cardioprotective agents) should

be considered and planned in all patients before the start and throughout the treatment. In the JGDG study,

patients in both treatment groups that received 5 or more cycles of doxorubicin received dexrazoxane prior

to each dose of doxorubicin from cycle 5 onwards to minimize the risk of doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity

(see section 4.4 of the SmPC)

Laboratory findings were consistent with the general AE data. Abnormal LVEF results were numerically more

frequent in the investigational arm. However given the small numbers, no conclusion can be drawn. Overall,

the incidence of patients with treatment-emergent ADA was low. In general, the presence of treatment
emergent ADA does not seem to have a large impact on the overall safety profile or the occurrence of IRRs.

However, due to the small number of patients studied, definitive conclusions regarding the relationship

between ADA and IRR cannot be established and must await the results of the phase III confirmatory study

(See Annex II).

Overall, discontinuation due to AEs were similar in nature and frequency between both treatment arms, but

all 3 reported deaths occurred in the control arm.

In study JGDG, the overall number of patients over the age of 65 was limited, and more particularly the very

elderly patients (≥75). There was a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 adverse reactions, adverse reactions

leading to discontinuation and a higher rate of haematological toxicity in the elderly population compared to

the overall study population. The rates of discontinuation were comparable between treatment arms across

all age groups (see sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

Patients with liver/renal impairment were not implicitly excluded from the registration study. However, a

priori the impact of renal impairment on the safety of olaratumab is not expected to be significant. Only one

patient with mild liver impairment was enrolled in the study, which does not allow reaching any conclusions

on the safety in patients with hepatic impairment. However as doxorubicin is rapidly metabolised and

predominantly eliminated by the biliary system, the toxicity of doxorubicin is enhanced in patients with

hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

The safety profile in the LMS and non-LMS histological subtypes seems to be comparable. However, the small

number of patients within the other STS subtype populations precludes any conclusion in this patient

population. The applicant will conduct a post authorisation observational safety study to evaluate the safety

and effectiveness of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced STS, including

rare subtypes (see RMP).

In the investigational arm, females experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs more frequently than males (32 [84.2%]

vs. 19 [73.1%], respectively). This difference was also observed in the control arm (24 [72.7%] vs. 21

[65.6%] in the control arm, respectively). There were also differences in terms of the most frequently

reported TEAEs, with the largest differences observed for musculoskeletal pain (19 [73.1%] males vs. 22

[57.9%] females) and nausea (15 [57.7%] males vs. 32 [84.2%] females). There was no clear explanation

for these differences, partly due to the small sample size of the pivotal study.

Considering that the majority of patients included in the registration study were White (>80%), it is difficult

to reach a conclusion on the safety profile of other race/ethnic groups with the evidence available at this

time.

There is no experience with olaratumab overdose in human clinical trials. Olaratumab has been administered

up to 20 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle without reaching a maximum tolerated dose. In case of

overdose, supportive therapy should be used. There is no known antidote to Olaratumab overdose (see

section 4.9 of the SmPC).

Olaratumab may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to frequent occurrence

of fatigue, patients should be advised to use caution when driving or operating machinery (see section 4.7 of

the SmPC).

Olaratumab contains 146 mg sodium per each 50 mL vial which should be taken into consideration by

patients on a controlled sodium diet.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Summary of Product Characteristics.

***Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA***

Study JGDG was an early/phase exploratory trial and the overall exposure to the investigational treatment

could be considered relatively low. The size of the safety dataset is considered small only allowing

identification of the most frequent adverse events, and data on long-term use limited. The Applicant will

provide safety data from an ongoing confirmatory phase III trial which will address this issue.

Pain of different location and nature was the most remarkable finding in the safety evaluation of olaratumab.

Pain is a relevant AE due to its potential impact on quality of life and the confirmatory phase 3 study is

expected to refine data regarding the pain phenomena, its incidence, clinical course and optimal

management.

##### **2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety **

The safety of olaratumab plus doxorubicin as treatment of advanced STS patients and the added toxicity to

the current standard treatment with doxorubicin seem to be manageable.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context of a

conditional MA:

In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of olaratumab in the treatment of patients with advanced

soft tissue sarcoma, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the phase III study JGDJ comparing

doxorubicin plus olaratumab versus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic STS (including

exploratory biomarker data) by 31 January 2020.

In addition, the MAH will submit the second interim safety analysis of the phase III study JGDJ by 31

December 2016.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

The MAH should conduct and submit a post authorisation observational study to evaluate the safety and

effectiveness of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced STS, including rare

subtypes (see RMP) ***2.7. Risk Management Plan ***

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP):

The PRAC considered that the RMP version 1.0 (dated 14 January 2016) could be acceptable if the Applicant

implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC outcome section of the D94 PRAC Rapporteur

RMP assessment report (AR) dated 09 June 2016.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

The Applicant implemented all changes to the RMP as requested by the PRAC and the CHMP, as also detailed

in the RMP section of the Joint Updated PRAC / CHMP AR dated 09 September 2016.

The CHMP endorsed the RMP version 1.4, dated 14 September 2016, with the following content:

##### ***2.10. Product information *** **2.10.1. User consultation **

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the *Guideline on the*

*readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.* **2.10.2. Labelling exemptions **

A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been

submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons:

The QRD Group is of the view that the current proposal is not considered sufficiently justified .

It is acknowledged that including full particulars on the vial label, particularly for the trilingual, may be
challenging. However, there is certain information that is critical for the safe and effective use of this
medicinal product and it should, therefore, be included.

Considering that the size of the container is 50ml, the QRD Group is of the view that more information than
the currently proposed minimum particulars can be included.

The applicant is invited to first explore alternative labelling solutions such as labelling wrap ups or concertina,
which is already used for other products.

The following information is considered essential to ensure the safe and correct use of the product and should
also be included in the vial labelling:

- ‘ *For single use only* ’

- ‘ *Do not shake* ’

- Regarding the special storage conditions, at least, the statement “ *Keep the vial in the outer carton* ” is
considered especially relevant for the immediate labelling. If space allows ‘ *Store in a refrigerator* ’ or ‘ *Do not*
*freeze* ’ should also be considered for inclusion.

An exemption to the obligation to include the remaining particulars (excipients, out of sight and reach of
children, special disposal, etc.) is, however, considered acceptable.

The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the

Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in

grey-shading to show that they will not be included on the printed materials. **2.10.3. Additional monitoring **

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lartruvo (olaratumab) is included in the additional

monitoring list as:

- It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product

authorised in the EU

- It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14(7)]

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this

medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety

information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
### **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **
##### ***3.1. Therapeutic Context *** **3.1.1. Disease or condition **

STS is a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumours. There are more than 50 histological subtypes of

STS, associated with distinct clinical profiles, response to individual therapy and prognosis.

The olaratumab application is for the treatment in combination with doxorubicin, of adult patients with

advanced soft tissue sarcoma who are not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy and

who have not been previously treated with doxorubicin. **3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need **

Surgery is the gold-standard, and often only, curative treatment. Radiotherapy is often used to control local
recurrence in aggressive histological subtypes and/or when appropriate margins cannot be obtained, but it

has no effect on cure rates. Front-line advanced-disease treatment of the vast majority of STS subtypes

patients still rely on doxorubicin, a 40-year old drug, based on historical non-controlled research. Although

some progress has been made in the second-line setting, it has not translated into OS benefits in the first
line treatment. **3.1.3. Main clinical studies **

The olaratumab application is based on study JGDG, an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 1b/2 trial

conducted in the United States, which enrolled patients (age ≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically

confirmed, advanced STS not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy.

In the Phase 2 portion, patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin plus olaratumab or doxorubicin

alone. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion was to compare the PFS of patients treated with

olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin versus patients treated with doxorubicin alone. OS was a

secondary endpoint. ***3.2. Favourable effects ***

In the primary analysis (using the ITT population based on investigator assessment), the study met the

protocol-defined final significance level for PFS (2-sided alpha=0.1999). The combination of olaratumab and

doxorubicin provided an improvement in median PFS of 2.5 months over doxorubicin alone (stratified HR =

0.672 [95% CI: 0.442, 1.021]; p=0.0615), corresponding to a 32.8% reduction in the risk of progression or

death. The median PFS results were 6.6 and 4.1 months for the combination arm versus doxorubicin alone

respectively.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 109/115


-----

Results from a blinded independent review of radiologic scans support the investigator assessment (HR 0.670

95% CI: 0.401, 1.117). The median PFS results were 8.2 and 4.4 months for the combination arm versus

doxorubicin alone respectively.

Olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin reduced the risk of death in this population by 53.7% (HR =

0.463; 95% CI: 0.301, 0.710; p=0.0003), with a median overall survival in the Investigational arm of 26.5

months compared to 14.7 months in the Control arm. The 3- and 6-month survival rates were

(Investigational Arm vs. Control Arm) 95.2% versus 87.6% and 90.5% versus 73.3%, respectively.

Objective response rate (ORR) was higher in the combination arm (18.2%) than in the doxorubicin arm

(11.9%), although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.3214).
##### ***3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects ***

Despite the unexpected and outstanding results in OS, the longer life expectancy of those patients treated

with the combination is not intuitively linked to an increase in the delay of tumour progression.

No difference was seen between PDGFRα positive and negative which do not provide support to the

mechanism of action. Certainly, the different methods used and the expression of the receptor not only in

tumour cells but also on stroma, could explain at least partially this lack of pharmacodynamic effect.

Maintenance of single-agent olaratumab was allowed in the experimental arm, while crossover to single
agent olaratumab was permitted in control arm upon progression. Although it leaves behind important

unanswered questions, allowing maintenance treatment for experimental targeted agents maximizes patient's

survival options.

In summary, two main uncertainties about the beneficial effects of the experimental trial: the early nature of

clinical research supporting it and the lack of correlation between the biological basis of the disease and the

clinical benefit derived from treatment. These uncertainties should be addressed by the ongoing phase 3

confirmatory trial JGDJ. ***3.4. Unfavourable effects ***

The most common adverse reactions were nausea, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia and mucositis.

The most common serious adverse reactions (Grade ≥3) observed in olaratumab-treated patients are

neutropenia (54.7 %) and musculoskeletal pain (7.8 %).

The most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent treatment discontinuation occurred in

3 (4.7 %) patients of which the most frequent (≥ 1 %) were infusion-related reactions (3.1 %) and mucositis

(1.6 %).

The incidence of nausea, neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia were increased in the combination arm

compared to doxorubicin. There was a high incidence of painful events affecting over half of the patients

which were diverse in nature and anatomic location.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 110/115


-----

##### ***3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects ***

The size of the available safety database is considered limited and only allows identification of the most

frequent adverse events. The Applicant will provide safety data from an ongoing confirmatory phase III trial

which will address this issue.

Pain of different location and nature was the most remarkable finding in the safety section. Pain is a relevant

AE due to its potential impact on quality of life, the most relevant endpoint in the palliative treatment setting.

The trial data gave no clear relationship between the duration-severity of pain and the treatment with the

combination. The confirmatory phase 3 trial is expected to refine data regarding pain phenomena, its

incidence, clinical course and optimal management. ***3.6. Effects Table ***

##### ***3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion *** **3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects **

The request for conditional marketing authorisation is based on a single open-label, randomised phase 1b/2

trial (study JGDG) enrolling anthracycline-naïve patients with advanced STS. The analysis of efficacy showed

a remarkable improvement in OS, meaningful enough as to request conditional approval.

The survival was improved in patients treated with olaratumab and Kaplan-Meier curves showed an early

separation and a persistence of the OS benefit over time. After adjusting for factors most likely to affect

prognosis, olaratumab maintained its effect on all histological subgroups analysed. If confirmed, these results

could represent a shift in the treatment paradigm of advanced STS, introducing targeted treatments in the

broad STS arena. Furthermore, the main uncertainties related to the survival outcome should be

contextualized bearing in mind the different analyses aimed to show the robustness of the result.

However, the use of olaratumab as add-on to doxorubicin increases the frequency of AEs, worsening the

tolerability. Higher rates of neutropenia, nausea, anaemia, mucositis, thrombocytopenia and painful events,

were observed. Nevertheless, these AEs seem manageable and outweighed by the significant increase in

survival. This is further supported by the proportion of treatment discontinuations due to AEs (12.5% vs

18.5% combination vs monotherapy). **3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks **

The results from the pivotal study show a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS

with the olaratumab plus doxorubicin combination compared to doxorubicin single agent (HR 0.463, 95% CI:

0.301- 0.710, p=0.0003; median gain of 11.8 months).

In view of the benefits, the increased toxicity of the treatment combination seems tolerable and manageable. **3.7.3. Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance **

***Conditional marketing authorisation***

As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was requested

by the applicant in the initial submission.

The product falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 concerning conditional marketing

authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease, and is designated as an orphan

medicinal product.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/742133/2016 Page 112/115


-----

Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing

authorisation:

- The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed.

- It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.

The applicant has initiated a confirmatory Phase 3 double blind study, Study I5B-IE-JGDJ (JGDJ), in patients

with advanced STS; the first patient first visit occurred in September 2015. The primary objective of Study

JGDJ is to compare doxorubicin plus olaratumab versus doxorubicin plus placebo with respect to OS in 2

populations: (1) Patients with advanced or metastatic STS that is not amenable to treatment with surgery or

radiotherapy with curative intent; and (2) Patients with advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma (LMS) that is

not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent.

As of 20 July 2016, the number of patients randomised to the Phase 3 Study JGDJ is 505 (pre-planned

enrolment: 460), with all sites closed to screening except in Japan and Taiwan to meet local regulatory

requirements. A single interim efficacy analysis is planned after 194 events for OS have been observed in the

ITT population. Results will only be provided to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC), while

the applicant remains blinded to the data. In addition, the iDMC will perform unblinded safety reviews every 6

months following the first iDMC safety review meeting, with additional reviews performed per iDMC request.

Therefore, granting a conditional MA should not jeopardize the recruitment and it is likely that the applicant

will be able to provide results from the phase 3 study.

- Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the survival benefit observed in the pivotal study is

considered relevant in the treatment of advanced STS.

- The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that

additional data are still required as the survival advantage observed with olaratumab in the context of

the pivotal study is considered important enough not to further delay the availability of this medicine

to patients.
##### ***3.8. Conclusions ***

The overall B/R of Lartruvo is positive.
### **4. Recommendations **

***Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products***

The CHMP, by consensus, is of the opinion that Lartruvo is not similar to Yondelis within the meaning of

Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

***Outcome***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the

risk-benefit balance of Lartruvo is favourable in the following indication:

Lartruvo is indicated in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with advanced soft

tissue sarcoma who are not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy and who have not
