## **2. Scientific discussion **
#### ***2.1. Problem statement ***

Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited applied for a marketing authorization in accordance with

Article 8(3) of Directive No 2001/83/EC for Vazkepa, Icosapent ethyl (AMR101, ethyl-EPA) 1 g* soft

capsules for the treatment of

*Vascepa is indicated to reduce cardiovascular risk as an adjunct to statin therapy in adult patients with*
*elevated triglyceride levels and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.*

The proposed daily oral dose of icosapent ethyl was 4 *g to be taken as two 1 *g capsules twice daily.

The CHMP approved Vazkepa for the following indication:

*Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high*

*cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (* ≥ *150 mg/dL) and*

*• established cardiovascular disease, or*

*• diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor.*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on*

*cardiovascular events see section 5.1.*

The recommended daily oral dose is 4 capsules taken as two 998* mg capsules twice daily.

*During the review process, the strength was redefined in accordance with EU guidelines to 998 mg
which represents the content of the active substance without the antioxidant. In the clinical studies the
strength is stated to be 1 g as this is the declaration that was used until the redefinition during the EU
review. **2.1.1. Disease or condition **

Cardiovascular disease encompasses a broad group of medical problems that affect the circulatory

system (the heart, blood vessels and arteries). Despite medical advances and broader use of available

therapies such as statins, CVD remains the number one cause of death globally. **2.1.2. Epidemiology, Aetiology and pathogenesis **

Cardiovascular disease causes more than half of all deaths across the European Region (World Health

Organization [WHO] data accessed 13 May 2019). In the EU, each year CVD causes over 1.8 million

deaths (around 800 000 deaths in men and 1 million deaths in women) which is 37% of all deaths

(European Heart Network Report, 2017). In 2015, there were 6.1 million new cases of CVD in the EU

and almost 49 million people were living with CVD in the EU. Half of these new CVD cases were due to

ischaemic heart disease (1.63 million new cases in males, 1.4 million new cases in females), while

EMA/145271/2021 Page 8/129


-----

around 10% of new CVD cases were due to stroke (286 000 among males and 340 000 in females).

Prevalence of severe hypertriglyceridemia (500 to 2,000 mg/dl) is rare Christian JB et al., The

American Journal of Cardiology 2011; 107: 891 – 897) but elevated triglycerides at 150 mg/dL are a

frequent observation. In Europe, the overall prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dL) has

been reported as 29.6% (Qiao Q, Group DS Diabetologia 2006; 49:2837–2846), while the prevalence

of hypertriglyceridemia in individuals with coronary artery disease ranges between 21.1 and 44.6 %

(KotsevaK et al., Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 2009; 16:121–137).

Hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular

disease (CVD). high TG levels are often associated with low HDL-C and high levels of small dense LDL

particles. The burden of HTG is high, with about one-third of adult individuals having TG levels

>1.7 mmol/l (150 mg/dL) (Bergheanu SC et al. Neth Heart J 2017; 25: 231–242), Catapano AL et al.,

Eur Heart J. 2016;37:2999).

Lp(a) is a specialised form of LDL and consists of an LDL-like particle and the specific apolipoprotein

(apo) A. Elevated Lp(a) is an additional independent risk marker and genetic data made it likely to be

causal in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic vascular disease and aortic stenosis (Kronenberg F et

al., J Int Med. 2013; 273:6–30).
#### **2.1.3. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis **

For a detailed review over clinical presentation and diagnostic approaches in patients with

hypertriglyceridemia at increased CV risk it is referred to current clinical guidelines. Since 2003, the

European Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice recommend use of the SCORE system to

evaluate CV risk, because it is based on large, representative European cohort datasets. Patients at

higher risk of CVD include those with hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol [TC], TG, LDL-C or combined

hyperlipidaemia [both TC and TG], diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, and/or a family

history of CVD. A more recent approach of differentiating CV risk in the context of the treatment of

dyslipidemias has been proposed in the ESC/EAS Guideline for the management of dyslipidaemias,

European Heart Journal (2020) 41, 111 – 188, Table 4, differentiating in more detail how CV risk

categories relate to underlying conditions in this therapeutic area. **2.1.4. Management **

Current Treatments for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Elevated Lipids

Drugs that lower lipid levels include inhibitors of statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, selective cholesterol

absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe), fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid) and bile acid sequestrants (anion

exchange resins).

In the EU, statins are currently the primary choice for lowering lipids due to their positive effect on

decreasing CV morbidity and mortality (Catapano 2016). Patients with dyslipidaemia, particularly those

with established CVD, diabetes mellitus (DM) or asymptomatic high risk individuals, may not always

reach treatment goals, even with the highest tolerated statin dose. Therefore, combination treatment

with statin may be recommended to prevent CVD in patients with persistent dyslipidaemia. Combined

therapies with statin approved in the EU for prevention of CVD include PCSK9 inhibitors and selective

cholesterol absorption inhibitors. The evidence of the CV benefit of fibrates (combined with statin and

as monotherapy) and niacin is limited. Bile acid sequestrants are poorly tolerated and tend to increase

plasma TG concentrations and are therefore not recommended by the ESC/EAS for routine use in CVD

prevention2.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 9/129


-----

The use of statins in the EU for primary and/or secondary prevention of CVD is well established.

Findings from 24 European countries reported the use of statins at 86% on average (Kotseva 2016).

Statins, by decreasing LDL C, reduce CV morbidity and mortality as well as the need for coronary

artery interventions (Colhoun 2004, Collins 2003). Statins at doses that effectively reduce LDL C by at

least 50% also seem to halt progression or even contribute to regression of coronary atherosclerosis

(Nissen 2006). A large meta-analysis reported a 10% proportional reduction in all cause mortality and

20% proportional reduction in coronary artery disease (CAD) death per 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) LDL C

reduction (Baigent 2010). The risk of major coronary events was reduced by 24% and the risk of

stroke was reduced by 16% per 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) LDL C reduction. Relative CV risk declines as

LDL C is decreased, and, while theoretically a ‘floor’ exists, the level at which LDL C reduction does not

further reduce risk has not yet been defined.

PCSK9 inhibitors and selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors are used as statin add on therapies in

patients with persistent elevated LDL C. PCSK9 inhibitors can produce a rapid decrease in LDL C by up

to 60%, either as monotherapy or in addition to the maximal statin dose (Piepoli 2016). A meta

analysis of data from 20 trials indicated that compared with placebo, PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab,

bococizumab and evolocumab) decreased the risk of CVD events, with a risk difference of 0.91%, but

also increased the risk of adverse events, with a risk difference on 1.54%, the latter primarily due to

the adverse effects of bococizumab, the development of which has been discontinued due to its

immunogenicity (Schmidt 2017). Selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe) are not

usually used as monotherapy to decrease LDL C concentrations, unless patients are intolerant to

statins. The ESC/EAS guidelines recommend selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors as combination

therapy with statins in selected patients when a specific goal is not reached with the maximal tolerated

dose of a statin (Catapano 2016)4. Based on the relatively limited body of evidence, clinicians may

restrict the use of combination therapy with ezetimibe and statin to patients at high or very high risk of

CVD.

Fibrates and niacin are used primarily to lower TG levels and increase HDL C and have the potential to

be used as statin add on therapies in patients with persistent elevated TG levels. Evidence supporting

the use of fibrates or niacin for CVD event reduction is limited. Furthermore, niacin is not currently

approved in the EU. The 2016 ESC/ESA guidelines recommend combination treatment of statins with

fenofibrate in high risk statin treated subjects with TGs >2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)4. The efficacy of

fibrates on CVD outcomes has not been clearly demonstrated (Jakob 2016, Cochrane review), despite

reducing TG by up to 50% and increasing HDL C up to 10 15% (Catapano 2016). It has been reported

that combinations of statins with fibrates may enhance the risk for myopathy (Catapano 2016)4. The

joint ESC/ESA state that gemfibrozil should not be added to a statin treatment, because of the high

potential for interactions (Piepoli 2016). The EMA conducted a review of nicotinic acid and related

substances in 2013 (EMA/402540/2013). This resulted in the suspension of medicines containing the

combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant across the EU because new data failed to show any

reduction in risk of major CV events (such as heart attack and stroke) and a higher frequency of non

fatal but serious side effects.

In conclusion, current treatments for the prevention of CVD are available for statin treated patients

with persistent elevated LDL C levels. However, elevated TG levels are also associated with

atherosclerosis, increased risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality. In the EU there are no authorised

treatments for the prevention of CVD in statin treated patients with elevated TG levels. Vazkepa is

proposed for use in patients with elevated TGs who are already being treated with statins but remain

at risk for major adverse coronary events (MACE).

#### ***About the product ***

Vazkepa contains icosapent ethyl, a derivative of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). EPA is part of approved

medicinal products containing EPA/DHA that are licenced for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

“ *Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high*

*cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (* ≥ *150 mg/dL) and:*

*• established cardiovascular disease, or*

*• diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on*

*cardiovascular events see Section 5.1. ”*

(revised wording)

It is intended for long-term therapy. The recommended daily oral dose is 4 capsules taken as two

998 mg capsules twice daily. ***Type of Application and aspects on development ***

The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was

not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following argumentation.

“Although treatment options are available aiming at reduction of cardiovascular risk on top of statin

therapy (PCSK9, ezetimibe) or at reduction of high triglyceride levels (fibrates, niacin, Omacor

[containing EPA.DHA]), there is still a need to further reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in

patients at increased cardiovascular risk despite appropriate baseline therapy. This constitutes a major

public health interest. However, it is not obvious that Vazkepa addresses this unmet medical need.

Vazkepa contains icosapent ethyl, a derivative of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). EPA is part of approved

medicinal products containing EPA/DHA that are licenced for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

Previous trials investigating EPA/DHA and EPA in lower doses provided conflicting results. EPA/DHA

containing drugs at lower doses lack efficacy in patients after myocardial infarction, and the results of

another study with EPA at 1800 mg daily (JELIS study) are not straightforward in demonstrating a

beneficial effect on CV outcome and all-cause mortality.

Different from previous trials, in the single pivotal trial supporting Vazkepa (REDUCE IT), the purified

active moiety eicosapentaenoic acid was ethyl esterified and used at a higher dose (4 g daily) and DHA

was not part of the product.

The association between the reduction of high TG and the CV outcomes is the matter of the discussion.

The results of previous studies targeting the TG to reduce the CV risk are conflicting. In addition, the

mode of action of EPA is not clear as the reduction of TG can explain only partly the beneficial effects

observed in the REDUCE IT study.

The top-line results of the REDUCE-IT were seen as promising. However, a thorough review of all

available data is needed as in this single pivotal trial there were some safety issues identified (e.g.

increase risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter or serious bleeding events including intracranial in the active

treatment arm) that require in depth analyses of benefit/risk balance in subgroups and with co
medications. Also, the choice of the comparator in the pivotal trial (mineral oil) could be questioned.

These considerations together with the numerous areas of uncertainty raise doubts that this medicinal

product is of major interest from the point of view of public health, in particular from the viewpoint of

therapeutic innovation and if an accelerated time frame is appropriate given that it can be foreseen

that an assessment of benefit and risk balance may not be straightforward and requires time and

resources for the initial assessment and detailed discussions with the applicant within the procedure.”
#### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

The finished product is presented as soft capsules containing 998 mg of icosapent ethyl as active

substance.

Other ingredients are:

Capsule fill: all-rac-alpha-tocopherol

Capsule shell: gelatin, glycerol, maltitol liquid (E965 ii), sorbitol liquid, non-crystallising (E420 ii),

purified water, and lecithin

Printing ink: titanium dioxide, propylene glycol, and hypromellose

The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child-resistant

polypropylene heat induction sealed closure and PVC/PCTFE/Al perforated unit dose blisters as

described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. **2.2.2. Active Substance **

***General information***

The chemical name of active substance is ethyl ( *5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z* )-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoate

corresponding to the molecular formula C 22 H 34 O 2 . It has a relative molecular weight of 330.50 and the

following structure:
##### **Figure 1: Active substance structure **

The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of GC-MS spectrometry,

13 C-NMR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectrometry, and elemental

analysis.

The active substance is a liquid oil at ambient room temperature with high solubility in organic solvents

but no detectable solubility in water. The active substance has a low aqueous solubility and high

permeability, it therefore is classified as a Class 2 compound according to the Biopharmaceutical

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 12/129


-----

Classification System. The active substance is an oil that is insoluble in water and therefore not

hygroscopic.

The active substance has a non-chiral molecular structure and polymorphism has not been observed.

The active substance can be readily oxidized, thus reducing the amount of eicosapentaenoic acid

available for release following hydrolysis and also affecting the taste and smell of the oil. Therefore, it

requires protection against oxidation. An antioxidant, all-rac-α-tocopherol, is added to the bulk active

substance. Tocopherol is commonly used as an antioxidant by manufacturers of purified fish oil

products. The addition of a suitable anti-oxidant (tocopherol) to the active substance is in line with the

requirements of the Ph. Eur. monographs 2063 Omega-3-acid ethyl ester 60 and 1250 Omega-3-acid

ethyl ester 90. In this case, none of these Ph. Eur. monographs is considered applicable in the entire

form due to significantly different content of ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-EE) and

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA-EE).

***Manufacture, characterisation and process controls***

Two active substance manufacturers were approved.

Different manufacturing processes are conducted by the individual active substance manufacturers.

The applied production processes are based only on multiple purification procedures such as

rectification/distillation and chromatography alone or combination of rectification/ distillation with

chromatography lacking any synthetic chemical step. Depending on the individual active substance

manufacturer, classification of the production process as dis-continuous or continuous or a combination

of both is requested where necessary. In each case, tocopherol is added during the last manufacturing

step.

Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance for the two approved manufacturers

has been provided and it was considered satisfactory.

According to current ICH and EMA Guidelines, there is no specific guidance on the control of organic

pollutants in active substances and finished products. However, principles of the ICH M7 Guideline

would apply for mutagenic substances. Satisfactory information on potential impurities has been

provided.

Furthermore, considering in general the requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph 1250 Omega-3-acid

ethyl ester 90, a sufficient control strategy for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines and polychlorinated

dibenzofuranes, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes and dioxinlike

polychlorinated biphenyls, non-dioxinlike polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylether

was required in each ASMF as Major Objection (MO). The control strategy was provided, and it was

considered satisfactory.

In addition, transfer of the requirements for pesticides of Ph. Eur. monograph 2.8.13 Pesticide residues

(which is primarily applicable for herbal drugs) to chemical medicinal products is considered possible,

from the toxicological point of view. Sufficient control strategies for the most relevant pesticides in the

API was requested where necessary as MO for both ASMFs. The control strategy was provided and

considered satisfactory.An additional MO was raised regarding the limited of information provided on

potential impurities for one of the manufacturers of the active substance. The information on potential

impurities was provided and it was considered satisfactory.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the syntheses. The specifications and control methods

for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline

on chemistry of new active substances.

Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The active substance packaging materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011

as amended.

***Specification***

The active substance specification from the manufacturer of the finished product includes tests for

description (visual), identification of icosapent ethyl (IR, GC), identification of tocopherol (HPLC), assay

of icosapent ethyl (GC), tocopherol (HPCL), refractive index (Ph. Eur.), peroxide value (Ph. Eur.),

anisidine value (Ph. Eur.), acid value (Ph. Eur.), cholesterol (USP), oligomers (Ph. Eur.), moisture (Ph.

Eur.), sulphated ash/residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), relative density/specific gravity (Ph. Eur.), inorganic

impurities (ICP), residual solvents (GC), environmental contaminants (GC-MS), related substances

(GC), other individual related substances (GC), and total related substances (GC).

The potential sources of impurities which may be present in icosapent ethyl are process impurities

present in the active substance, and degradation products generated during active substance handling

or storage.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods)

appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the

reference standards used for testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data of 52 batches of the active substance were provided. The results are within the

specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

***Stability***

Stability studies were performed by the two manufactures of the active substances proposed, in

general, the results of long-term, intermediate and accelerate stability data show that there is no

significant change in any of the parameters studied. Based on the results from forced degradation and

photo-stability studies, it was shown that the active substance is stable under light and high

temperature but unstable with acid, base, humidity and oxygen.

More specific information on stability of the two manufacturers of the active substance is given bellow:

**Active Substance Manufact** **u** **r** **e** **r** **1**

Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer

stored simulated market containers for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH)

and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines

were provided.

The following parameters were tested *:* appearance, EPA EE assay, alpha-tocopherol assay, peroxide

value and p-anisidine value *.* The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were

stability indicating.

All parameters tested comply with the specification at accelerated stability study, and at long term

stability study in the specified packaging. There are minimal changes in the tested parameters except

for the oxidation indicating parameters, i.e. anisidine value and peroxide value. The results comply

with the specification at all time points up to 36 months with exception of the assay results discussed

-----

above which were due to possible degradation during testing of the samples. All other stability

indicating parameters were within specification.

Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. In the

photostability study, the peroxide value slightly increased which can be attributed to the formation of

peroxides caused by photo-oxidation. The only other slight change is the odour of the sample which

has been reported as a slight fishy odour. This could be consistent with the production of low

concentrations of volatile components as a by-product of photo-oxidation, which are commonly

attributed as the cause of fishy odour of omega-3 products. There was no change in the other test

parameters.

Results on stress conditions (high temperature and oxidative) were also provide on one batch There

are no significant changes in EPA EE or α -tocopherol assay, which confirms that elevated storage

temperatures do affect the oxidative stability of the active substance, but not to the degree that the

assay decreases, or the antioxidant is consumed.

The overall stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is

sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored in

original containers blanketed with nitrogen in the proposed container.

**Active Substance Manufact** **u** **r** **e** **r** **2**

Stability data from 12 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer

stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions

(25 ºC / 60% RH), for up 12 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH), and for up to 6

months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.

The parameters tested are the same as for release.

All batches remain within specifications under long term, intermediate and accelerated stability

conditions.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months without
restrictions in storage conditions in the proposed container.
#### **2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product **

***Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development***

The finished product is supplied as soft gelatin capsules for oral administration containing 998 mg of

the active substance. The soft gelatin capsule is oblong measuring 25 x 10 mm and printed with “IPE”

in white ink, with a light yellow to amber shell containing a colourless to pale yellow liquid.

Soft gelatine capsules containing fish oil are standard dosage form that has been available for many
years. Based on historical experience, a standard soft gelatine capsule formulation, including suitable
plasticizer excipients, was selected for the finished product.

The active substance is the ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA-EE). It is hydrolyzed by esterases
to liberate the free fatty acid EPA. Extensive stability studies have demonstrated compatibility and
### stability of the active substance with the capsule shell excipients .

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 15/129


-----

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur
standards except opacode which is tested according to in-house specifications. There are no novel
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The primary packaging material is high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child-resistant

polypropylene heat induction sealed closure and PVC/PCTFE/Al perforated unit dose blisters. The

material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has

been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

***Manufacture of the product and process controls***

The bulk product is manufactured by three manufacturing sites.

The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: fill material preparation process, gelatine shell

preparation process, encapsulation and drying process, capsule printing process, and bulk packaging

process. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.

The finished product dossier information provided, indicated that the three finished product

manufacturing sites proposed, seemed to produce different medicinal products. The approval three

different medicinal products within one marketing authorization was not considered acceptable.

Consequently, the CHMP requested as Major Objection (MO) that the following issues should be solved:

the composition of the finished product should be the same for all manufacturing sites, to provide the

common manufacturing description with unified IPCs and separately identify as well as justify technical

adaptions applied to the different manufacturing sites hence a single section containing information on

the manufacturing process has to be provided. In addition, the stability data provided indicated that

the different manufacturing sites produce finished products of different quality, therefore a discussion

and justification of the impact of observed differences in regard to the product quality and stability

should be provided. As response, the applicant combined the information from the three finished

product sections, and slight differences between the manufacturing process were identified and

justified. Description and composition of the finished product were combined for all manufacturing sites

and the composition of finished product was presented across manufacturers. A common

manufacturing description of the manufacturing process has been presented to provide an overall

description of the manufacturing process that applies across all manufacturers, including a description

of the process for primary packaging. The stability data for the finished product is extensive in number

of batches, with data generated for finished product manufactured by all three proposed

manufacturers. Results are generally within specifications at long term conditions and no significant

trends are observed. It is, however, recognized that some variability is seen, which in most cases is

related to analytical variability; this was considered satisfactory.

Critical steps were identified, and the proposed in-process controls are adequate for this type of

manufacturing process. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of

studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished

product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. Taking into account the applicant’s long-time

experience in producing soft capsules and validation data available no additional validation data are

considered necessary within this marketing authorization procedure. Confirmation has been provided

that validation activities conducted to support the scale up of the commercial batch size. However, it

could not be concluded that the process to manufacture of the finished product is fully validated for

each proposed batch size with the data provided. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that per

manufacturing site, the first three consecutive commercial batches of the largest scale batches should

be fully validated. Process validation batches will be prepared and executed according to the validation

-----

scheme as provided in Module 3.2.R. The process validation at the maximum capsule batch size

should take into consideration all previous process validation data for smaller batch sizes and

demonstrate that the manufacturing process is independent of batch size within the range of all

previous process validation batches. With this successful demonstration of scale independence all batch

sizes within this range will be.

***Product specification***

The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of

dosage form: description (visual), identification of icosapent ethyl (GC, IR); identification of tocopherol

(HPLC), uniformity of dosage form (Ph. Eur.), assay of icosapent ethyl (GC), assay of tocopherol

(HPLC), disintegration, minutes (Ph. Eur.), peroxide value (Ph. Eur.), anisidine Value (Ph. Eur.) and

microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.)

The specification parameters and limits are considered acceptable.

Each of the finished product manufacturers have performed risk assessments to evaluate the potential
presence of elemental impurities in the finished product in accordance with the ICH Q3D Guideline for
Elemental Impurities. The assessment of elemental impurities contributed from potential sources
including active substance, excipients, manufacturing process, and container closure systems was
provided. The overall risk assessment supports that the current manufacturing process and in-process
controls in place provide adequate control for elemental impurities. No additional controls have been
recommended by the manufacturers and no changes have been made to them due to the risk

assessment *.*

The applicant has conducted a risk assessment for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the
finished product in response to the CHMP request and in accordance with Guidance EMA/189634/2019.
This risk assessment included a review of the entire product supply chain including excipient / active
pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing, bulk finished product manufacturing, and packaging
components. The risk assessments and supplier statements for each component resulted in no risk

identified for nitrosamine contamination.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in

accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used

testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results were provided for several batches from the three manufacturers confirming the

consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product

specification.

***Stability of the product***

Stability studies have been performed in the finished product manufactured by the three

manufacturers.

Stability data from numerous batches of the finished product from each one of the three manufacturers

and the physician sample presentation were provided. The batches were stored for up to 60 months

from the date of manufacture (of bulk capsules) under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), and for

up to 6 months from the date of manufacture (of bulk capsules) under accelerated conditions (40ºC /

75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical

to those proposed for marketing and were packed within two proposed for marketing container
closures.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 17/129


-----

Stability data in bulk container from one commercial scale batch of the finished product from each the

proposed manufacturer stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH).

Samples were tested for description (capsules), description (package), disintegration, hardness,

peroxide value, anisidine value, assay icosapent ethyl, assay of tocopherol, related substances, each

other individual impurities, total related impurities, and microbiological enumeration. The analytical

procedures used are stability indicating.

There are no trends observed with finished product at long term and accelerated stability conditions for

the finished product in the two containers proposed for marketing manufactured by the 3

manufacturers. The data remain well within the shelf-life specification.

No stability studies have been initiated on the capsules packed in PVC/PCTFE/Al blisters manufactured

by one manufacturing site. The applicant justified that all packaging activities for both bottle and

blister presentations occur at the same packaging manufacturers regardless of the source of the bulk

finished product. The applicant stated that the stability data for blister packages is fully representative

of the quality and performance of the finished product for all bulk finished product manufacturers and

the reason why stability studies for blister packages made using this bulk finished product had not

been initiated due to the less frequent manufacturing schedule compared to bottles. The CHMP

recommended that, although the product has shown good stability based on the data provided, the

first three commercial scale batches manufactured at each manufacturing site (largest scale validation

batches) should be placed on long term as well as accelerated stability program to get representative

data confirming stability of the finished product at each manufacturing site.

One batch of three packaging configurations (bottle, blister and bulk) were studied in a photostability

program in accordance with ICH Q1B, Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products,

Option 2. All samples met the acceptance criteria specified in the protocol, and there are no apparent

data trends. The data demonstrate that the finished product packaged in the proposed primary

packaging is stable to light conditionsThe primary and supportive stability data demonstrate that the

finished product is stable in bulk for up to 24 months at 25°C/60%RH. There was an observed trend of

increasing Peroxide Value, but the data remain well within the shelf-life specification. No other

significant changes in test results are observed for test intervals up to 24 months in capsules stored at

the long-term condition.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years from the date of manufacture (of

bulk capsules) and store below 30°C as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

***Adventitious agents***

Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the

gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.
#### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

This product is a soft capsule containing 998 mg of icosapent ethyl. It is manufactured from fish oil and

is further highly purified through multiple purification procedures. The active moiety of icosapent ethyl

(EPA-EE) is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).

The major objections relating to absence of organic pollutants in the active substance control and for

polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes, polychlorinated dibenzo-p
dioxines and polychlorinated dibenzofuranes and dioxinlike polychlorinated biphenyls, non-dioxinlike

-----

polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenylether control have has been resolved by

implementing a control strategy. Regarding the major objection on the limited information on potential

impurities of the active substance by one of the ASMFH, this information has been provided and

considered satisfactory. Moreover, an additional major objection on the finished product in relation to

the demonstration of comparability of finished product from different manufacturing sites was raised.

The applicant has provided information which demonstrates that the finished product manufactured at

different manufacturing sites produce finished product of the same quality. However, some variability

is seen, which in most cases is related to analytical variability and this was considered satisfactory.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has

been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that

the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no

impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.
#### **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has

been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. **2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development **

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,

the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

- Per manufacturing site the first three consecutive commercial batches of the largest scale batches

should be fully validated. Process validation batches will be prepared and executed according to the

validation scheme as provided in Module 3.2.R. The process validation at the maximum capsule batch

size should take into consideration all previous process validation data for smaller batch sizes and

demonstrate that the manufacturing process is independent of batch size within the range of all

previous process validation batches. With this successful demonstration of scale independence all batch

sizes within this range will be considered validated.

- First three commercial scale batches manufactured at each manufacturing site (largest scale

validation batches) should be placed on long term as well as accelerated stability program to get

representative data confirming stability of the finished product at each manufacturing site. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

The applicant has not performed its own studies on the pre-clinical pharmacology of EPA, but instead

the applicant discussed the results of some published pharmacology studies performed with EPA.

The nonclinical testing strategy for AMR101 was based on extensive information on the toxicology

profile, and the clinical safety of Ethyl-EPA in the public domain.

Assessment report

Amarin has evaluated the extensive published literature available on the safety of Ethyl-EPA, and

accordingly commissioned a relevant, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant, animal sparing,

toxicology program in mice, rats and dogs according to ICH M3(R2).

These studies include: a 28-day study in wild-type rasH2 mice, two 28-day studies in rats (Wistar,

Sprague Dawley), a 14-day dose-range finding study in beagle dogs, a 39-week study in beagle dogs,

a developmental toxicity study in rats (Wistar), standard battery of genotoxicity studies, a 104-week

carcinogenicity study in rats (Wistar), and a 26-week carcinogenicity study in 001178-T (hemizygous)

mice. Amarin’s investigation of the literature identified toxicology studies conducted by Mochida and

these are provided in lieu of study reports.
#### **2.3.2. Pharmacology ** ***Primary pharmacodynamic studies ***

The primary mechanism of action of EPA is due to enhanced beta-oxidation of fatty acids resulting in

less substrate for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, enhancement of lipoprotein lipase

(LPL) activity, inhibition of apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3), activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated

receptors (PPARs), hepatic lipase (HL) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP); reduction of

proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) may also be affected by Ω-3FA intake. EPA has

an inhibitory effect on intestinal cholesterol absorption and hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, and an

enhancing effect on hepatic biliary secretion. Ethyl-EPA treatment increases the clearance of serum

lipoproteins from the serum. Administration of EPA leads to an increase in the EPA content of all the

fractions of phospholipids, cholesteryl esters and TG. Ethyl-EPA reduced the incorporation of oleate into

TG in hepatic microsomes and also reduced the rate of hepatic TG secretion. Ethyl-EPA exerts an

inhibitory effect on hepatic TG synthesis/secretion and a stimulatory effect on TG degradation,

resulting in a reduction in particle size and an increase in the ratio of apoE/apoC. Ethyl-EPA causes a

modification of LDL such that Ethyl-EPA has an enhancing effect on the hepatic uptake of LDL. EPA-E

attenuates progression of hepatic fibrosis in developed steatohepatitis via an inhibition of ROS

production. ***Secondary pharmacodynamic studies ***

EPA suppresses the platelet aggregation induced by collagen, arachidonic acid (AA) and ADP, and EPA
E can reduce platelet aggregability by the change of the EPA level in the platelet phospholipids. Ω-3FAs

result in reduced levels of fibrinogen, factor V and thrombin.

Ω-3FA-induced atheroprotection include their role as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents; EPA

attenuates nitric oxide synthesis, lipid peroxidation and generation of reactive oxygen species in

human-derived embryonic endothelial cells and reduces LDL oxidation and glucose-induced lipid

peroxidation and inflammatory markers associated with atherosclerosis. EPA-E has a suppressive effect

on thrombosis and reduces atherosclerotic lesions through its anti-inflammatory effects. EPA

attenuates arterial medial calcification through an inhibition of macrophage infiltration and improves

the in-vivo distensibility of arteriosclerotic arteries. EPA administration also promotes

neovascularization in ischemic models and improves endothelium-derived vasodilatation.

Ω-3 PUFAs prevent cardiac arrhythmias based on their actions to inhibit the voltage-dependent Na [+]

current and the L-type Ca [2+] currents and prevent triggered arrhythmic after-potential discharges

caused by excessive cytosolic Ca [2+] fluctuations. PUFAs have a negative inotropic effect due to

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 20/129


-----

reduction of I Ca,L and intracellular Ca [2+] concentration in cardiac myocytes. EPA attenuated atrial

fibrillation promotion and atrial remodelling.

EPA has anti-inflammatory properties inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism and COX-2 activity.

Mediators from major Ω-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA termed resolvins (resolution-phase interaction

products) and protectins possess pro-resolving, anti-inflammatory (reducing neutrophil traffic, pro
inflammatory cytokines and excessive proinflammatory gene expression) and antifibrotic as well as

host-directed antimicrobial actions. Ω-3FA intake reduces leukotrienes, prostaglandins and other

markers of leukocyte activation (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1 and hsCRP). Ω-3FAs have multiple hemodynamic

effects: reductions in resting heart rate and blood pressure, in addition to increased vasodilatation and

arterial compliance.

Obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with high levels of free fatty acids from the

breakdown of dysregulated TG (lipolysis) in adipose tissue, and TNF-α is a proinflammatory cytokine

that is increased in obesity and implicated in the development of insulin resistance. EPA inhibits pro
inflammatory cytokine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes, and this effect might contribute to the insulin
sensitizing properties of EPA.

Administration of Ω-3 fatty acid improves neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,

Huntington's disease (HD) and schizophrenia. EPA protects against neurodegeneration by modulating

synaptic plasticity, preventing oxidative stress-triggered apoptotic cell death, reversing age-related

changes in interleukin-1ß-induced apoptotic cell death, and by its capacity to increase brain

docosahexaenoic acid, leading to sustained long-term potentiation.
#### ***Safety pharmacology programme ***

No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted.

At micromolar concentrations EPA inhibits cardiac I Ca,L, I Na and several cardiac K [+] channels (I to, I K and

I Kur ). These effects on cardiac ion channels might be responsible for the increased incidence of atrial

fibrillation observed after the administration of EPA in humans. To date no study evaluating the effect

of EPA on hERG channels has been performed or is available in the public literature. Because EPA

inhibits I K (which is composed of I Kr and I Ks ), but has no effect on I Ks, it is tempting to speculate that

EPA has inhibitory effects on I Kr /hERG channels, and this hypothesis is reinforced by the observation

that the structurally similar arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid both inhibit hERG channels.

According to the requirement laid down in ICH S7B and in order to characterize the electrophysiology

of EPA, hERG channel inhibition by unbound EPA will be studied by the applicant via whole-cell patch
clamp recordings in cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA, and the final report will be available by

the end of February 2021. ***Pharmacodynamic drug interactions ***

The Applicant mentions a study of Yanagisawa (1992) where no synergistic effects on bleeding time or

ADP-induced platelet aggregation were observed in rabbits when EPA and ticlopidine were

administered concomitantly. ***Conclusion ***

The primary pharmacologic effects of Ethyl-EPA are on lipid and lipoprotein levels (reduction of serum

lipids and lipoproteins).

Assessment report

The secondary pharmacology effects of Ethyl-EPA that have been discussed in the literature are:

  - beneficial effect on thrombosis and artherosclerosis (inhibition of platelet aggregation and

thrombus formation),

  - anti-inflammatory properties (formation of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids such as resolvins,

down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, down-regulation of arachidonic acid

metabolism),

  - cardioprotective effects (maintenance of arterial elasticity and effect on blood flow),

  - neuroprotective effects (neuro-anti-inflammatory effects, effects on central nervous system

(CNS) disorders and psychiatric disorders),

  - and improvement of the metabolic profile in animal models of diabetes
#### **2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics **

Fatty acids are absorbed from the small intestine without being absorbed by the stomach; whereas

short to medium-chain fatty acids are transferred into the physiological environment via the portal

vein, long-chain fatty acids are transferred via the lymph; the formation of a mixed micelle with bile

acids is necessary for absorption of lipids.

The absorption speed and degree of absorption of 14C-EPA-E was promoted by bile, since fatty acids

form a mixed micelle immediately before absorption, and the presence of bile acids is important for the

formation of this mixed micelle. EPA has a very high extent of plasma protein binding (nearly 100 % in

dogs, 98.8 – 99.8 % in humans and 97.3 – 99.9 % in rats).

In rats unchanged Ethyl-EPA was not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and all lipid radioactivity

in lymph was attributed to de-esterified Ethyl-EPA (i.e. EPA). Dogs orally administered [14] C-EPA-E

showed a distribution pattern considerably different from rats, since most of the radioactivity was in

LDL and HDL, but little in VLDL and chylomicron. Such a difference could partly be attributable to the

lower rate of gastrointestinal absorption of EPA-E in dogs and an interspecies difference of the rate of

conversion of chylomicron or VLDL to LDL could also exist: in humans 75 - 90 % of VLDL is converted

to LDL, whereas only 10 % of VLDL is metabolized to LDL in rats.

In rats after oral administration of Ethyl-EPA, the results of whole-body autoradiography demonstrated

that the tissue concentrations showed maxima after 9 - 24 hours and then slowly declined. Repeated

administrations result in the increase in the concentrations of radioactivity in the heart, liver, brain and

adipose tissues, and maximum values in brain, fat and skin are reached 1 week after administration,

and elimination from the brain was particularly slow (half-life of 8 - 40 days). Tissue concentration

after daily administrations of [14] C-EPA-E over 4 to 12 days was higher than that after a single

administration with the concentration after 12 administrations rising to 3.5 - 40-fold that after a single

administration. The elimination half-life of radioactivity from tissues was 7.6 – 8.4 days, and, thus,

similar to that from plasma and from adipose tissue, suggesting that the elimination of Ethyl-EPA and

its metabolites follows the metabolic cycle of fat.

After absorption, long-chain fatty acids are incorporated in the triglycerides in the epithelial cells of the

small intestine, then are bound to apo-proteins, secreted by chylomicrons or VLDL to lymph, before

being transferred into the blood and then into the tissues.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 22/129


-----

When [14] C-Ethyl-EPA (30 mg/kg) was administered orally to pregnant rats on the 12th and 19th days of

gestation, radioactivity was transferred to the foetus. In lactating rats, radiolabelled EPA reached C max

in milk 6 – 14-times higher than the [14] C-EPA concentrations in maternal blood.

The supplementation of EPA promoted the omega-3 metabolic pathway thus displacing omega-6 and 9

series fatty acids from the lipid fractions.

The following metabolic pathway can be proposed for EPA-E: EPA-E is first de-esterified in small

intestine and incorporated into TG and PL mainly as a compositional fatty acid, then distributed to

various tissues through lymph and plasma, and finally ß-oxidized by mitochondria and peroxisomes,

mainly in the liver and also in each tissue. A certain portion of EPA is metabolized to DPA and DHA by

elongation and desaturation reactions in microsomes and/or peroxisomes. DPA and DHA also undergo

ß-oxidation in the mitochondrial fraction containing peroxisomes. DHA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid

present in various tissues, especially in nerve tissues and synaptic membranes. A retroconversion

enzyme that converts DHA to EPA has been found in rat liver. DPA and DHA may, either after

conversion to EPA or directly, be also metabolized through the ß-oxidation process and tricarboxylic

acid (TCA) cycle to CO 2 and water.

EPA is an efficient substrate of CYP2C enzymes. EPA is metabolized to several classes of oxygenated

metabolites by the same CYP isoforms as those that metabolize arachidonic acid (AA). The CYP
mediated metabolites of EPA elicit biological effects different from the CYP-mediated metabolites of AA,

and dosing with Ethyl-EPA shifts the CYP-dependent generation of physiologically active eicosanoids

from AA-derived metabolites to those derived from EPA and this shift may be partially responsible for

some of the beneficial effects of EPA.

After administration of [14] C-Ethyl-EPA to Wistar rats, the radioactivity is mainly excreted in expired

breath, and the excretion rates over 7 days in urine, faeces and expired air were 2.7 - 3.3 %, 16.7 –

18.3 % and 44.4 – 51.4 %, respectively. In dogs, the excretion was 1.0 % in urine and 19.2 % in

faeces.

The inhibitory effect of EPA and other polyunsaturated fatty acids on human CYPs obtained from a

recombinant expression system consisting of baculovirus-transfected insect cells were studied, and

furthermore, EPA was evaluated as an inhibitor of human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes using an in

vitro model based on biotransformation rates of index substrates by human liver microsomes. EPS was

found to inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A with Ki values of 4.4 – 127 µM, and the most

sensitive were CYP isoforms of the 2C family. After dosing with 2 and 4 g/day AMR101 for 28 days in

healthy volunteers (Study AMR-01-01-0018), the mean C max values of unesterified EPA in plasma were

2.55 µM and 5.04 µM, respectively. Therefore, an inhibition of the following CYP isoforms by EPA

indicated a possible DDI (in decreasing order of potential): 2C19, 2C9, 2C8 and 2B6. Based on the

results from the in vitro evaluation of the inhibition potential of EPA on CYP isoenzymes, the Applicant

has performed clinical drug-drug interaction studies (see Clinical AR).

EPA was not an inducer of human CYP enzymes CYP3A, CYP2C9 and CYP1A2 using an in-vitro model

based on cultured human hepatocytes.

EPA at a concentration of 1 μM did not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3

mediated transport of probe substrate, but slightly inhibited the transport of probe substrate of OAT3.

Ethyl-EPA, given to Male Wistar rats as single doses or as repeated doses for 14 days at 30 mg/kg, has

little effect on the microsomal drug metabolizing system.

#### **2.3.4. Toxicology ** ***Single dose toxicity ***

No single dose toxicity testing of AMR101 was conducted in rodents. Instead, two study reports from

acute toxicity testing of Epadel® (Ethyl-EPA) and its main metabolites and impurities found in public

databases were submitted. Epadel® was licenced in Japan since 1991 for the treatment of similar

indications like arteriosclerosis obliterans. The study reports submitted were all part of the registration

process for Epadel® in Japan. Comparison of these study reports to the current OECD guidelines for

GLP indicated compliance (determination of the scientific validity of using published studies according

Klimisch et al, 1997) to GLP requirements with several exceptions (i.e. absence of a statement of

compliance with GLP, lack of individual data).

To show comparability between both Ethyl-EPA products the applicant submitted a pivotal 28-day

repeat-dose study in rats treated with equal amounts of AMR101- and Epadel® demonstrating

qualitative and quantitative consistency between both products.

No systemic toxicity or special target organs were detected for the mother substance, major

metabolites or impurities up to the highest dose tested (2000 mg/kg) in mice and rats. The

toxicological profiles were consistent with the observations from all other studies submitted for

rodents.

After oral administration LD 50 values in rodents (mouse, rat) were approximately 20000 mg/kg and

above, the highest dose tested. This corresponds to Ethyl-EPA safety margins of 28 x in mice and 56 x

in rat based on the HED (human equivalent dose) concept with a maximal clinical dose of 4000 mg. ***Repeat dose toxicity ***

Toxikokinetics

Safety margins in repeat-dose toxicity studies have been calculated based on total plasma

concentrations for EPA. As EPA is highly protein bound to a similar extend across species, this is

acceptable. Ethyl-EPA was hardly detectable in plasma of animals. Therefore, the applicant has also

performed safety margin calculations based on body surface area (HED concept) for Ethyl-EPA, which

are mostly in line with AUC-based safety margins for EPA (see respective repeat-dose toxicity studies).

Studies in rats

In the rat chronic administration testing (3 month and 12 month) of Ethyl-EPA were adapted from two

study reports from public databases with the Ethyl-EPA product Epadel® licenced in Japan. No

toxikokinetic (TK) data were determined in these studies. Additional two pivotal GLP 28-day rat repeat
dose toxicity studies with AMR101 were conducted to show qualitative and quantitative consistency

between both Ethyl-EPA products at equal dosages. TK data of (unesterified) EPA were determined in

both studies.

In the 3-month and 12-month rat toxicity studies by Shibutani and both pivotal 28-day GLP rat studies

consistent toxicology profiles of Ethyl-EPA at equal dosages were obtained. Except expected

pharmacodynamic effects no serious toxic systemic effects in any organ were detected. Major findings

were transient decreases in body weight and irritation of the skin caused by leakage of the test

substance from the anus and restricted to the highest dosages of Ethyl-EPA. All other findings were

small in magnitude, reversible and without histopathologic correlate. The toxicological profiles were

consistent with the observations from all other studies submitted for rodents.

In the 28-day rat comparative pivotal toxicity study according GLP, no significant differences between

AMR101 and Epadel® as well as compared to control were detected regarding to PD, PK/TK and

toxicology of (Ethyl)-EPA.

Toxicity findings were restricted to expected pharmacodynamic-related decreases in cholesterol and

triglycerides and therefore not considered of concern. Other observations were consistent with the

toxicology profile observed in other toxicology studies conducted in rodents.

Small variations in haematology and clinical chemistry parameters were without correlated

haematological abnormality and were therefore considered to be normal biological variation.

Histopathologic observations were without microscopic correlates or with a similar incidence in control

and regarded as incidental findings normal for the age and strain of rats. Except expected

pharmacodynamic effects no serious toxic systemic effects in any organ were detected.

No significant differences with respect to pharmacodynamic and TK parameters between AMR101 and

Epadel® were observed.

Safety margins based on TK at NOAEL (2000 mg/kg/d, C max unesterified EPA (d 28) 16400 (♂)/17300 (♀)

ng/ml, AUC unesterified EPA (d 28) 196000 (♂)/140200 (♀) ng h/ml) and clinical exposures (4000 mg/d,

C max unesterified EPA (d 28) 1520 ng/ml, AUC unesterified EPA (d 28) 20300 ng h/ml) were approximately 11 x

for C max, respectively 8 x for AUC.

In the pivotal GLP 28-day rat study, no significant differences with respect to the toxicology profile

were observed compared to the other toxicology studies conducted in rodents. Variations in

haematology parameters were small in magnitude and without histopathologic abnormality. TK data

were concomitantly obtained in this study. Exposures (C max, AUC) increased sub-proportional with

increasing doses suggesting a saturation of absorption. No clear or consistent sex related differences

were determined.

In conclusion, no significant differences with respect to quality and quantity characteristics were

detected between AMR-101 from different suppliers and Epadel®. The NOAEL corresponded to the

highest dose consistently in every rodent study and showed appropriate exposure margins towards

human therapeutic exposures. Together with the long-time clinical experience with Epadel® and with

respect to safety, the assessor agrees that AMR101 is sufficiently tested in rodents.

Studies in dogs

In a 39-weeks repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs observed toxicities were mostly related to the

pharmacological action of EPA (changes in plasma concentrations of lipids) and local irritation due to

increased excretion. Findings in animals at 1000 mg/kg/day were considered not to be adverse and

there was evidence that they were reversible or were of a type that would be reversible. Thus, the

NOAEL in this study was set at 1000 mg/kg/day, which is endorsed. This corresponds ~9 x the

maximum recommended human dose of 4000 mg/d based on body surface area comparison for Ethyl
EPA and 8 x relative to the AUC of EPA at the dose of 4000 mg/d obtained from the healthy volunteer

study AMR-01-01-0018. TK investigations showed low systemic exposure to Ethyl-EPA when compared

with the metabolite EPA and that systemic exposure to EPA was extensive. EPA systemic exposure

increased in a supra-proportional manner with increasing dose following administration of AMR101 on

Day 1. Exposure (C max(obs) and AUC0-t) to EPA was higher during Week 13 than on Day 1 in both males

and females, which is an indication of accumulation, as expected from a drug with a long half-life.

#### ***Genotoxicity ***

A complete GLP-conform genotoxicty test battery has been performed with AMR101 (Ethyl-EPA + 0.2%

DLαTocopherol) including an Ames test, in vitro chromosome aberration assay and a in vivo

micronucleus test in albino mice. In addition, GLP-conform Ames tests and in vitro chromosome

aberration assays have been performed with AMR101 from suppliers. One further in vitro chromosome

aberration assay has been performed with EPA and oleic- and linoleic acid as reference compounds. All

Ethyl-EPA preparations were negative in Ames assays up to 5000 µg/plate indicating that they are not

mutagenic. A positive response was seen for all preparations in in vitro chromosome aberration assays

including DEA, and linoleic and oleic acid. This implicates that clastogenicity is a class effect of fatty

acids under these test conditions. To follow up these positive results Amarin has performed an in vivo

micronucleus test albino mice treated with a single ip dose of 4550 mg/kg AMR101. No increase in

micronucleated erythrocytes was observed after 24 and 48 hours post dose. Mice showed no clinical

signs, exposure was not determined. According to ICH S2(R1) a positive outcome in an in vitro test

would trigger the need for a second endpoint in the in vivo genotoxicity assay. However, because

Ethyl-EPA is a naturally occurring fatty acid and was negative in carcinogenicity studies performed in

mice and rats, no further studies are warranted. ***Carcinogenicity ***

Carcinogenicity studies with Ethyl-EPA have been performed in rats (2-year carcinogenicity study) and

Tg-RasH2 mice for 6 months. Ethyl-EPA was negative in the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study at doses

up to 910 mg/kg/d. Haemangioma and haemangiosarcoma were observed in mesenteric lymph nodes

in all male groups, including control, and females at ≥ 270 mg/kg/d. However, overall incidence of

haemangiomas and haemangiosarcomas in all vascular tissues did not increase with treatment and

findings in mesenteric lymph nodes were not considered of human relevance. Exposure was not

determined in this study, however, EPA TK data could be bridged from 28-day rat repeat-dose toxicity

study at 1000 mg/kg/d indicating sufficiently high exposure of rats which is approx. 7-fold human

exposure at 4000 mg/daily dose. Ethyl-EPA was also negative in the 6-month Tg-RasH2 mice

carcinogenicity study at doses up to 4600 mg/kg/d. Ethyl-EPA-related incidences of benign squamous

cell papilloma in the skin and subcutis of the proximal tail were observed at 4600 mg/kg/day in male

mice only. Papillomas were considered to develop secondary to chronic irritation of the proximal tail

associated with faecal excretion of oil and therefore not clinically relevant. EPA exposure at the high

dose was approximately 4 x human exposure at 4000 mg/daily dose. Based on the results of the

carcinogenicity studies with Ethyl-EPA no carcinogenic risk is expected for humans. ***Reproduction Toxicity ***

Except for a pivotal GLP-conform embryo-foetal development study in rats no further reproductive and

developmental toxicity testing of AMR101 was conducted. For an appropriate reproductive and

developmental toxicity testing the applicant referred to the reference product Epadel® licensed since

1991 in Japan and the respective studies published in the literature.

These studies represented a full reproductive and developmental toxicity program according to the ICH

M3 guideline. The study reports had several limitations concerning the OECD guideline for GLP (1997),

among other things, a statement of compliance with GLP is missing and individual data are lacking.

With respect to the long-time clinical experience and the extensive toxicological and clinical safety data

together with the results of the two 4-week comparative rat toxicology studies with AMR101 alone and

AMR101 and Epadel® this seems acceptable.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 26/129


-----

No TK data were measured in any reproductive toxicology studies conducted in pregnant rats or

rabbits. According to the Japanese authority, Ministry of Health and Welfare, there was no requirement

to collect TK data at that time. However, TK analysis was performed in two 4-week comparative rat

toxicology studies with AMR101 alone and AMR101 and Epadel® with no significant qualitative and

quantitative differences observed between the two Ethyl-EPA products.

Ethyl-EPA indicated no influence on fertility in rats of both genders up to the highest doses tested.

Ethyl-EPA indicated no reproductive toxicity in rats. In rabbits a not significant tendency of an

increased number of resorbed or dead foetuses accompanied by marked but reversible maternal

toxicity (body weight loss) was observed in the high dose group.

Toxicology studies indicate that Ethyl-EPA crossed the placenta, found in foetal plasma and was

excreted in breast-milk.

Safety margins to clinical exposures were not calculated (C max, AUC) and only HED based calculations

at NO(A)EL dose levels were presented.

An estimation of a safety margin based on rat and human exposures (C max, AUC) were calculated on

the basis of TK results obtained from the 28-day pivotal toxicity study conducted in rats and human

study AMR-01-01-0018. Safety margins based on TK at NOAEL (2000 mg/kg/d, C max unesterified EPA (d 28)

16400 (♂)/17300 (♀) ng/ml, AUC unesterified EPA (d 28) 196000 (♂)/140200 (♀) ng h/ml) and clinical

exposures (4000 mg/d, C max unesterified EPA (d 28) 1520 ng/ml, AUC unesterified EPA (d 28) 20300 ng h/ml)

were approximately 11 x for C max, respectively 8 x for AUC.

No TK data was submitted for the rabbit. Ethyl-EPA safety margins based on the HED at rabbit NOEL

(1000 mg/kg/d) for reproduction and embryo-foetal development and the clinical dose (4000 mg/kg/d)

were approximately 5.8 x.

Under the conditions of the studies Ethyl-EPA had no influence on fertility in rats and was not

teratogenic in rats and rabbits under the conditions of the study.

**Juvenile animal studies**

No juvenile toxicity studies were provided by the applicant which is acceptable, since AMR101 is not

intended for juvenile patients.
#### ***Other toxicity studies ***

Comparative studies

To demonstrate qualitative and quantitative comparability between AMR101 from different suppliers

the applicant conducted three 28-day rat repeat-dose studies according GLP. A study duration of 1

month will maximize the exposure to any new impurities. Due to the limited TK sampling, except

exposure data (C max ), TK parameters were not calculated. No significant differences between AMR101

(Ethyl-EPA) from different suppliers concerning toxicological endpoints and TK (Cmax) were observed

in comparative 1-month toxicity studies conducted in rats.

Impurities

The related substance specifications for unknown, identified and qualified impurities have been set in

compliance with ICH Q3A(R2). As all of these compounds are structurally related to Ethyl-EPA no

safety concern arises from higher amounts than the specification limit in the drug substance. In

conclusion, all related impurities can be considered as qualified from a toxicological point of view and

no new toxicity studies are warranted.

#### **2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or

distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, eicosapentaenoic acid is not expected to

pose a risk to the environment. **2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

No major non-clinical safety findings have been identified which may be of significant clinical

relevance.

The primary pharmacologic effects of Ethyl-EPA are on lipid and lipoprotein levels (reduction of serum

lipids and lipoproteins). Among the secondary pharmacology effects of Ethyl-EPA that have been

discussed in the literature are beneficial effect on thrombosis and atherosclerosis (inhibition of platelet

aggregation and thrombus formation), anti-inflammatory properties (formation of anti-inflammatory

eicosanoids such as resolvins, down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, down-regulation of

arachidonic acid metabolism), cardioprotective effects (maintenance of arterial elasticity and effect on

blood flow), neuroprotective effects (neuro-anti-inflammatory effects, effects on central nervous

system (CNS) disorders and psychiatric disorders) and improvement of the metabolic profile in animal

models of diabetes.

No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. According to the ICH S7B Guideline and in order

to characterize the electrophysiology of EPA, hERG channel inhibition by unbound EPA will be studied

by the Applicant via whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA, and

the final report will be available by the end of February 2021. **2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

No non-clinical safety findings have been identified which may be of significant clinical relevance and

the safety specification of the RMP. A hERG study with unbound EPA will be performed by the

Applicant and the final report will be available by the end of February 2021 (REC). The application was

considered approvable from nonclinical point of view. ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction ** ***GCP ***

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

#### **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics ** ***Absorption ***

Vazkepa (icosapent ethyl or ethyl-EPA) is the ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). After dosing humans with clinical doses

of Vazkepa, only very low levels of ethyl-EPA are sporadically detected in plasma. Therefore, the major chemical moiety in the systemic circulation after

Vazkepa administration is the active metabolite EPA, and appropriate assays were developed to measure EPA in plasma for the evaluation of

pharmacokinetics (PK).

After oral administration of ethyl-EPA (icosapent ethyl), the parent drug is completely or nearly completely de-esterified during the absorption process

and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed into the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct lymphatic system.

EPA is incorporated into circulating phospholipids (PL), triacylglycerols (TAG) or triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (CE). Only a small fraction of the total

circulating EPA concentration is unesterified, i.e., free or protein bound, and not incorporated in these lipids. Therefore, the major assay for PK

evaluations measured total EPA: the total EPA concentration in plasma includes unesterified EPA and EPA incorporated in PL, TAG, and CE.

EPA is also incorporated in the phospholipids of cell membranes wherein EPA provides structural properties to the membrane (for example fluidity in red

blood cell membranes), but more importantly, is a source for intracellular activities related to its triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects.

Because of the ease of sample collection, omega-3 fatty acids are often measured in red blood cells (RBC) as a marker for tissue exposure. Therefore,

the appropriate assays were also developed to measure EPA in RBC after Vazkepa administration. In RBC, almost all EPA is incorporated in phospholipids

of the cell membrane.

Analytical methods

A Gas Chromatography Plus Flame Ionization Detector assay was used to quantify 28 fatty acids (the fatty acid profile), including EPA, in RBC and plasma

samples. For each fatty acid, the total concentrations are measured, which include unesterified fatty acids and fatty acids incorporated (esterified) in

TAG, PL and CE.

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring total EPA in human plasma and RBC.

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring total EPA in human serum.

Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring unesterified EPA in human plasma. This assay

was also used in Amarin-sponsored nonclinical toxicology studies in mouse, rat, and dog.

Baseline total EPA plasma concentrations

Baseline total EPA plasma concentrations were variable between the subjects, with study-wide mean (± SD) of 15.3 ± 15.2 μg/mL.

Unesterified EPA

Only a small fraction of total EPA exposure is unesterified EPA. The study-wide mean ± SD baseline unesterified EPA plasma concentration was 0.099 ±

0.095 μg/mL, which is less than 1% of the total EPA plasma concentration. Based on plasma AUC and C max after dosing Vazkepa, 0.3 to 0.5 % of the

total EPA was unesterified. Unesterified EPA concentrations in both plasma and RBC accumulated in a similar fashion as for total EPA.

Ethyl - EPA

Because of the expected low exposure of the parent drug, ethyl-EPA, plasma concentrations of ethyl-EPA were not routinely measured in the Amarin
sponsored clinical studies. However, as a post-hoc analysis, a limited number of plasma samples were analyzed for ethyl-EPA. Ethyl-EPA was not

quantifiable (<50 ng/mL) in most samples.

-----

A single oral dose of 2 g Vazkepa resulted in a slow rise in plasma EPA concentrations. Maximum values were observed 5 hours after dosing, with EPA

concentrations remaining above baseline 48 hours after administration.
#### ***Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination ***

EPA is naturally present in plasma and RBC. After absorption, EPA is distributed and (re)incorporated into circulating PL, TAG and CE, and into the

phospholipid components of cell membranes. In RBC, almost all EPA is incorporated into PL of the cell membrane. Only a small fraction of the total

circulating EPA concentration is unesterified, i.e., not incorporated in TAG, PL, CE, and RBC.

The steady-state volume of distribution of EPA after 28 days administration of Vazkepa, was large (~80 L).

Metabolism is according to standard lipid turnover of the body.

Pathways of Hydrolysis of Ethyl-EPA and Metabolism/Bio-activation of EPA

COX = cyclooxygenase; LOX = lipoxygenase; LT = leukotriene; PG = prostaglandin; R v = resolving; TX = thromboxane

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 35/129


-----

Elimination of EPA and its metabolites is similar to that of fatty acids from dietary and endogenous lipids, with the end products (CO 2 and water)

principally excreted in expired breath.

After oral 14C-ethyl-EPA administration to rats, the radioactivity was principally excreted in expired breath (~50 %), minimally in urine (~3 %), and ~17

% in faeces. A similar experiment in dogs showed 1 % in urine and 19 % in faeces (expired air was not analysed).

Thus, EPA is metabolized and excreted through a high-capacity process that is almost unaffected by variables such as kidney and liver function.

Elimination kinetic after 28 days of dosing was examined in study AMR-01-01-0018. In-group 2 (2 g BID) T1/2 (mean (SD)) after the last dose was 152

(53.3) hrs.

#### ***Dose proportionality and time dependencies ***

Mean (SD) baseline-unadjusted total EPA plasma trough concentration (group 2 with 2 g Vazkepa BID)

Though not significant, it appears that EPA plasma trough concentrations still increase from day 14 to day 26 / day 28. This is underpinned by RBC EPA

|trough concentrations.|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Geometric Means|||Ratio of Geo. Means (95% CI)||p values||

Therefore, it is assumed, that total EPA concentration in the body increases over at least a period of 28 days with Vazkepa 4 g / day.

-----

In ANCHOR and MARINE studies, of the total molar fatty acid concentration in plasma, EPA did constitute 1.9 mol % after 12 weeks of 2 g/day Vazkepa,

and 3.4-3.6 mol % after 4 g/day Vazkepa, versus 0.4-0.5% at baseline (which did not change in the placebo group). Similar results were seen in RBC.

Single dose PK at steady state

Data from study AMR-01-01-0018 indicate comparable PK at steady state, though the increase in EPA concentration (C max – C min ) is apparently higher (~

135 μg/mL, c.f. a value of ~55.5 (µg/g) seen with the first 2 g Vazkepa dose).

Mean Trough EPA Concentrations (95% CI)

Plasma                                  RBC

Based on C max and AUC of total and unesterified EPA in plasma and EPA in RBCs, the mean exposure to EPA appears dose-proportional between 2 and 4

g/day AMR101, and this is supported by the statistical comparisons (p>0.05) of dose-normalized PK values.
#### ***Pharmacokinetics in target population ***

Pharmacokinetics appear to be very similar in healthy subjects, patients with hypertriglyceridemia (MARINE and ANCHOR studies) and in patients with

cardiovascular risk factors (REDUCE-IT study).

#### ***Special populations ***

Impaired hepatic or renal function

Studies investigating the effect of renal insufficiency or hepatic insufficiency on the PK of Vazkepa were not performed. EPA pathway in the body are

manifold and include neither the kidney nor the liver in an emphasized position. Available clinical data suggest neutral to positive effects of omega-3-acid

ethyl esters (OM3) in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Severe renal dysfunction may be associated with a decrease in protein binding due to a decrease in protein concentrations or binding itself. However,

only ~35% of albumin carries even a single fatty acid, on average and molar percentage of EPA, relative to pooled total fatty acids, increased with EPA

treatment from 0.5% to 5.8%, with no increase in the total fatty acid pool. Safety data derived from key Phase 3 study based on renal function sub
populations reveal no meaningful imbalances in the frequencies of AEs between Vazkepa and placebo groups that would indicate a safety concern for

patients with more advanced renal impairment.

Race

Steady-state serum concentrations from the REDUCE-IT study were evaluated with respect to race. Though partly significant differences are observed at

Year 1 these differences are relatively modest and serum EPA levels after Year 1 show no statistically significant differences between subgroups of race.

Based on PK considerations clinically relevant differences related to race in efficacy or safety are not expected.

Gender

In studies AMR-01-01-0018, MARINE and in ANCHOR only minor differences for EPA PK in respect of gender were observed.

Weight and BMI

In both MARINE and ANCHOR, body weight appeared to have a small and inconsistent effect on the EPA concentration in plasma or RBC. However, in the

different subgroups defined by BMI tertiles in ANCHOR after 4 g/day Vazkepa differences are visible. In RBC EPA increase (mean (SE)) in the first tertile

(BMI < 30 kg/m2) was 83.6 (3.90) µg/mL (n = 22) but just 39.3 (3.86) in the third tertile (>35 kg/m2; n = 24). In plasma similar data were found

(187.7 (12.95) vs. 121.4 (9.21)). However, the serum levels of EPA reached on-treatment with Vazkepa at all time-points were substantial for all

subgroups, with no obvious differences observed in efficacy and safety across the various BMI subgroups.

Elderly

A clinical study in age-associated memory impaired patients aged 50 to 70 years shows agreement with the PK data from healthy volunteers and from

patients with other CNS disorders, demonstrating that, in general, the PK of EPA after Vazkepa administration was similar in older subjects (50-70 years)

as compared to younger subjects.

With Vazkepa 4 g / day a higher concentration of plasma total EPA in patients with an age of 65 or older was observed (Plasma EPA Concentration,

REDUCE-IT, Change from Baseline to year 1 (µg/mL Median (IQR)) <65 years 111.3 (108.4); 65-<75 years 124.5 (113.8); ≥ 75 years 127.6 (125.5)).

The finding was not considered clinically relevant with respect to efficacy. Concerning safety it is noted that a higher rate of bleedings and hemorrhagic

strokes was observed in the ≥ 75 year age group for Vazkepa vs. Placebo but not in patients < 65 years. Whether the about 15% higher mean exposure

in patients ≥ 75 year age contributed to this finding may not be clarified based on the data available.

-----

Serum EPA levels appear generally similar across the age subgroups, with any mean or median differences between subgroups being modest, particularly

in comparison to observed IQRs.

The serum levels of EPA reached on-treatment with Vazkepa at all time-points were substantial for all subgroups. Available EPA PK data do not provide

evidence to infer a substantial difference in efficacy or safety across subgroups of age.

Children

A product-specific waiver was granted.
#### ***Pharmacokinetic interaction studies ***

The general interaction potential of an essential fatty acid of the omega-3 series is considered small. Due to the diversity of metabolic pathways and

widely distributed storage in the body, relevant effects of other drugs on EPA-PK are unlikely.

In vitro studies show that EPA is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent of CYP2B6 and CYP3A. This was addressed by

interaction studies with omeprazole (to address CYP2C19), rosiglitazone (to address CYP2C8), warfarin (to address CYP2C9) and atorvastatin (to address

CYP3A4). Other CYP-enzymes are involved in metabolism of the drugs as well e.g. CYP2C9 (rosiglitazone), CYP1A2, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (warfarin).

Though not all results exclude any interaction, the observed deviations are small and e.g. for omeprazole and rosiglitazone not in accordance with the

assumption of an increased exposure due to CYP inhibition.

In subgroup analyses from MARINE and ANCHOR studies, no consistent effect of antihypertensive drugs, antiplatelet drugs and statins (atorvastatin,

rosuvastatin and simvastatin) on EPA-concentrations was detected.

Thus, based on the submitted data, absence of specific clinically relevant drug-drug-interactions can be assumed.

#### **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics ** ***Mechanism of action ***

The possible mechanism of action in patients with hypertriglyceridemia at increased CV risk is unclear. As outlined below, AMR101 decreases TGs in a

dose dependent manner. However, whether triglyceride lowering per se translates into a CV benefit is a matter of discussion. Several additional

mechanisms of action have been discussed in the publicly available literature. Among these are an impact on the regulation of NO and ONOO-1,

reduction of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, improvement of endothelial function and restoration of endothelium-dependent

vasodilation, effects on differentiation of monocytes into macrophages relevant for atherogenic processes, effects on inflammatory processes, plaque

stabilization and incorporation of EPA into platelet membranes that may reduce platelet aggregation. A multimodal concept of the potential mechanisms

of action has been published (Figure 3). The applicant has provided additional data indicating a primary action of EPA on the atherosclerotic process.

Primary pharmacology

Effects of AMR101 on the key lipid and inflammatory parameters has been investigated in the MARINE, and MARINE OLE, in ANCHOR and in the pivotal

REDUCE IT trial in adult patients with hypertriglyceridaemia.

In MARINE there was a consistent and dose dependent reduction in TG levels from baseline to week 12 and an increase with placebo (mineral oil). LDL-C

decreased numerically slightly, with AMR101 and placebo. Non HDL-C and VLDL-C decreased at a dose of 4 gr AMR101 daily and increased in the placebo

arm. Lp-PLA2 decreased at 4 gr. AMR101 with little change in the placebo arm. ApoB decreased at 4 gr AMR101 and increased in the placebo arm. For

hsCRP a decrease was observed with 4 gr an increase with placebo, and to a lesser degree with 2 gr. AMR101. Total cholesterol, VLDL-TG and to some

degree HDL-C decreased with AMR101 4g. A smaller reduction was seen for VLDL-TG for AMR101 2 gr with little change for the other parameters. With

placebo an increase in TC and VLDL-TG was seen and no change for HDL-C.

The results in ANCHOR were consistent with the following exceptions:

LDL increased in the placebo group and to a minor degree with AMR101 (both doses). Lp-PLA2 showed a moderate increase in the placebo arm. HDL-c

slightly increased with Placebo with little change in both AMR101 treatment groups.

It is unclear, to which degree mineral oil as a comparator is inert. The increase in hsCRP cannot be easily explained by variability or regression to the

mean effects. LDL-C increased in ANCHOR and in the pivotal REDUCE-IT trial but not in MARINE. Possibly, regression to the mean effects based on the

differences in LDL-C related inclusion criteria in the three studies contributed to the differential LDL-C pattern. Based on the information derived from

dose response (4 g vs. 2 g) and from change from baseline, AMR101 reduced TGs, VLDL-C, VLDL-TG, Lp-PLA2, and to some degree non-HDL-C, ApoB.

There was a decrease in TC and hsCRP when 4 g is compared with 2 g but not when compared with baseline.

The effect of AMR101 on TG was dose dependent and pronounced. This effect was preserved over one year as demonstrated in the MARINE OLE (open

label extension) study (see below, supportive studies).

Secondary pharmacology

There is considerable uncertainty of the pharmacodynamic mechanism leading to the clinical efficacy of EPA. Therefore, definite division in primary and

secondary pharmacology is not possible and it is referred to the primary pharmacology section above.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect

There was a linear correlation between plasma/erythrocyte EPA content and TG lowering effect based on the assessment of placebo control, AMR101 2g

daily and 4 g daily. Among the PD effects presented the TG lowering effect was most pronounced and therefore, there is a rationale to use it to assess

the PK/PD correlation. In addition, in a post hoc analysis a correlation between plasma/erythrocyte EPA concentration and clinical efficacy on MACE has

been observed. The relative contribution of the TG lowering effect and the relevance of different proposed mechanisms of action are unknown. It is

therefore not possible to finally conclude on the clinical relevance of the PK/PD correlation provided.
#### **2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology **

Pharmacokinetics

EPA is an essential omega-3 fatty acid, included in standard diet in different amounts. Marine fish is the primary natural dietary source of EPA.

Absorption and elimination in the plasma is slow (tmax ~ 5 h, t1/2 more than 3 days). Accordingly, EPA concentration in plasma and tissues increases to

steady state within a period of approximately one month. The increase in EPA after dosing with Vazkepa constitutes only a minor fraction of the total

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 47/129


-----

systemic fatty acid pool. EPA did constitute 3.4-3.6 mol % of the total molar fatty acid concentration in plasma after 12 weeks with 4 g/day Vazkepa,

versus 0.4-0.5 % at baseline. Similar results were seen in red blood cells (RBC).

The majority of EPA in plasma is esterified into phospholipids (PL), triacylglycerols (TAG) or triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (CE), with incorporation of

EPA in RBC and tissues. The most prominent degradation pathway is β-oxidation.

There was an about 15% higher exposure in patients ≥ 75 year age not considered relevant for efficacy. Whether the slightly higher exposure contributed

in part to the increase in bleeding events in the higher age groups may not be clarified based on the data available.

Possible drug-drug-interactions (DDI) have been addressed. No clinically relevant DDI could be identified.

The multi-factorial mechanisms of action contributing to the icosapent ethyl effects include improved lipid and lipoprotein profiles, such as a reduction in

triglyceride levels without raising low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to placebo, likely through reduced production and faster

clearance of triglycerides and decreased production of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and increased clearance of LDL particles. In addition,

anti-inflammatory effects of EPA may result from displacement of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (AA), directing catabolism away from eicosanoids (2
series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 4-series leukotrienes) to non- or anti-inflammatory mediators. EPA may also exert systemic anti
inflammatory and antioxidant effects as reflected by reductions in various biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipoprotein phospholipase A2

(Lp-PLA2), and oxidised LDL compared to placebo. EPA may inhibit platelet activation and aggregation and reduce mean platelet volume and count,

thereby exerting both anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic effects.

The applicant has provided additional analyses from the REDUCE-IT trial indicating a correlation between EPA concentration and efficacy on MACE. These

data from post hoc analyses are not considered conclusive mainly due to sparse sampling and a key impact of imputation rules on the overall results. The

exact mechanism for cardiovascular risk reduction remains unclear. This limits target-oriented determination of PD parameters. Therefore, determining

only some PD parameters is acceptable. Available data suggest that 4 g Vazkepa / day is an effective dose. Further PD data e.g. on hypertriglyceridaemia

are addressed in phase 3 studies and are discussed in the clinical efficacy section.

Pharmacodynamics and PK/PD correlation

The assessment of the PD effects of AMR101 is to some degree hampered by uncertainties related to the comparator mineral oil used in the PD studies

(MARINE and ANCHOR) and in the pivotal study (REDUCE-IT). Mineral oil may not be entirely inert but the relevance of possible negative effects of

mineral oil on CV outcome in the pivotal REDUCE-IT trial are limited. It was hypothesized that substance specific actions and indirect effects (e.g.

reduced absorption of drugs like statins) may affect lipids, lipoproteins and markers of inflammation. If so, in comparison to mineral oil effects may be

overestimated. However, as discussed in the context of the pivotal REDUCE-IT trial below, even under hypothetical worst-case assumptions, most of the

effects observed on lipid parameters and on clinical efficacy on MACE has to be attributed to Vazkepa. Consistently, there was a dose response from 2 g

to 4 gr AMR101 in the PD studies for several of the above-mentioned parameters. Based on an assessment of the difference between the effect of 4 gr

-----

and of 2 gr AMR101 reduced TGs, VLDL-C, VLDL-TG, Lp-PLA2, and to some degree non-HDL-C and ApoB. There was a decrease in TC and hsCRP when 4

gr is compared with 2 gr but not when compared with baseline.

The effect on TGs was preserved over one year as demonstrated in the MARINE OLE (open label extension) study. The long-term data provide some

reassurance regarding an absence of a relevant increase in LDL-C induced by AMR101. Overall, the effects on the lipid profile appear to be favourable. A

clear correlation between dose, concentration in plasma/erythrocytes and TG lowering effect was demonstrated.

Whereas these PD effects are clearly established, the relevance of these effects for the CV prevention indication is less clear. TG lowering on its own has

not been consistently been associated with a CV risk reduction. Many different possible mechanisms of actions have been proposed in the literature. The

applicant has provided data indicating beneficial effects of EPA on the atherosclerotic process based on imaging studies which allow direct visualisation of

drug effect on plaque burden, stability and rupture, as well as thin-cap fibroatheroma and macrophage accumulation. However, it is not clear, why

plaque stabilising effects of EPA would be associated with a lag time of more than one year before efficacy on MACE events are seen as was the case in

REDUCE-IT. Ultrasound studies have indicated smaller coronary atherosclerotic plaque or lipid volume in subjects on EPA therapy than in those not on

EPA therapy. Overall, at present the contribution of each of different proposed mechanisms of actions remains unclear.
#### **2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology **

The CHMP considered Vazkepa to be approvable from the clinical pharmacology point of view. ***2.5. Clinical efficacy ***

Vazkepa (AMR101, Ethyl-EPA) was intended for reduction of cardiovascular (CV) risk as an adjunct to statin therapy in adult patients with elevated

triglyceride (TG) levels and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The proposed by the applicant daily dose in adults was 4 capsules per day

taken with food.

The CHMP approved the following indication for Vazkepa:

*Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides*
*(≥150 mg/dL) and*

  - *established cardiovascular disease, or*

  - *diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor.*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on cardiovascular events see section 5.1.*

*The recommended daily oral dose is 4 capsules taken as two 998 mg capsules twice daily.*

Protocol Amendment 1 (16 May 2013) increased the lower end of fasting TG levels from ≥1.52 mmol/L (135 mg/dL) to ≥2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) without a variability allowance to increase enrolment of patients with TG levels at or above 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL). 2.

Included sites in United States, South Africa, The Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Italy, Russia, Ukraine, and India 4. at least 45 years old with documented CVD (secondary prevention group) OR at least 50 years old with diabetes and with at least one additional risk factor for CVD (primary prevention group) 5. in approximately 30% of enrolled patients 6. To facilitate enrolment, a protocol amendment was implemented after approximately 1/2 of patients were randomised: the haemoglobin A1c exclusion criterion was increased from 9.0% to >9.5%; based on known within patient variability for TG and LDL cholesterol, entry criteria were expanded so the mean of the 2 TG-qualifying values was ≥2.09 mmol/L (185 mg/dL) with ≥1 of the 2 values ≥2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL); and the upper limit of the LDL-C entry criteria was increased by 15% to 2.97 mmol/L (≤115 mg/dL)||||

The following studies in other indications were included in the dossier. These studies are not relevant

for the assessment of efficacy in the proposed CV prevention indication and therefore are not discussed

here.:

- Patients with Huntington’s Disease: 3 Studies: LA01.01.0005, AN01.01.0011, AN01.01.0012

- Patients with Schizophrenia: 1 Study: LA01.01.0001

#### **2.5.1. Dose response studies and main clinical study **

In the REDUCE-IT study a daily dose of AMR101 of 4 g (2 g BID with food) was investigated. No data

are available on the correlation between dose and efficacy on hard CV clinical endpoints.

The dose selection was mainly based on results from ANCHOR and MARINE/MARINE OLE. Prior to

MARINE and ANCHOR, more than 1000 patients had been exposed to AMR101 at doses up to 4 g per

day in the randomised, double-blind periods of Amarin-sponsored studies (see above). More than 700

patients had received continuous treatment with AMR101 1 g per day and 2 g per day (most patients

received 2 g per day). The Applicant states that AMR101 was well tolerated in these studies. ANCHOR

and MARINE studies investigated efficacy of two dose levels (1 and 2 g BID, i.e. 2g and 4 g daily dose

taken with food). MARINE OLE was an open label extension study investigating a daily dose of AMR101

4 g over 40 weeks. In these studies AMR101 resulted in a statistically significant reduction of TG

compared with placebo. A larger reduction in TG and some other lipid and lipoprotein parameters was

seen with AMR101 4 g/day than with AMR101 2 g/day. Data on PK/PD correlation based on these two

doses indicated a linear correlation between percent change from baseline to Week 12 in fasting TG

versus percent change in EPA concentration in plasma and red blood cells for the ITT population at

least up to a daily dose of 4 gr.

Based on these data 4 g/day (2 g BID) to be taken with food (i.e., with or at the end of their morning

and evening meals) was chosen as the only dose to be investigated in REDUCE-IT. The choice of the 4

g daily AMR101 dose appears to be reasonable when assuming that the TG lowering effect is relevant

for efficacy which is not clear. While information about efficacy of lower doses on CV endpoints is

missing, not including a lower dose treatment arm in the REDUCE-IT trial was not considered as an

issue of concern with respect to efficacy. With respect to safety it is unclear, whether AEs like

haemorrhagic events and atrial fibrillation would have been observed with similar frequency at a lower

dose level. **Main study ** **STUDY AMR-01-01-0019 (REDUCE-IT) **

#### ***Methods ***

It was a multi-center, multi-national, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,

parallel-group study designed to evaluate the effect of 2 g of AMR101 twice daily (BID) (4 g/day) for

preventing CV events in statin-treated patients with moderately elevated TG levels and other CVD risk

factors. The study was event driven. A total of approximately 7990 patients were planned to be

enrolled (i.e., randomized) in the study to either receive AMR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio

(approximately 3995 patients per treatment group) to observe an estimated 1612 primary endpoint

events. An overview over the study design is shown in Figure 9-1.

#### ***Treatments ***

Double-blind investigational products:

- AMR101 1 g capsules

- Placebo capsules (to match AMR101 1 g capsules)

The daily dose of study drug was 4 capsules per day taken orally as two capsules on two occasions per

day (two capsules given BID) with food.

AMR101 capsule fill contained icosapent ethyl and tocopherol and placebo capsule fill contained light

mineral oil and tocopherol. The same capsule shell was used for both AMR101 and placebo and

contained gelatin, non-crystalizing sorbitol, glycerin, water and maltitol. ***Objectives, outcomes and endpoints ***

The **primary objective** of this study was, in patients at LDL-C goal while on statin therapy, with

established CVD or at high risk for CVD and elevated TG (fasting TG ≥135 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL

[≥1.53 mmol/L and <5.64 mmol/L]), to evaluate the effect of 4 g/day AMR101 on the time from

randomization to the first occurrence of any component of the composite of the following major CV

events:

- CV death

- Nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) (including silent MI)

- Nonfatal stroke

- Coronary revascularization

- Unstable angina determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia by invasive/non-invasive testing

and requiring emergent hospitalization

The **key secondary objective** of this study was:

- To evaluate the effect of therapy on the time from randomization to the first occurrence of the

composite of CV death, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), or nonfatal stroke

Other secondary and tertiary objectives were predefined. ***Randomisation and blinding (masking) ***

It was a double blind study. Measures to keep blinding were in place.

Patients were assigned in a blinded manner according to a computer-generated randomization scheme

to one of two treatment groups at a 1:1 ratio via the IWRS.

Randomization was stratified by CV risk category, use of ezetimibe (yes/no), and by geographical

region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific). Two CV risk categories were defined, as

follows:

- CV Risk Category 1 (Secondary Prevention Cohort): patients with established CVD defined in the

inclusion criteria

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 57/129


-----

- CV Risk Category 2 (Primary Prevention Cohort): patients with diabetes and at least one additional

risk factor for CVD, but no established CVD

Patients with diabetes and established CVD were included in CV risk category 1. Stratification was

accounted for and recorded in the IWRS at the time of enrollment. Approximately 70% of the planned

7990 randomized patients were planned to be in the CV risk category 1, and approximately 30% of

randomized patients were planned to be in the CV risk category 2.
#### ***Statistical methods ***

All statistical analyses and data summaries were generated according to the statistical analysis plan

(SAP) and the SAP Addendum, both finalized prior to database lock and final unblinding.

The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population including all randomized patients.

For the primary endpoint, all observed data that were positively adjudicated by the Clinical Endpoint

Committee (CEC), including data after discontinuation of study drug for patients who discontinued

study drug prematurely, were included in the primary analysis. Patients who experienced no primary

endpoint event were censored at the date of their last visit/phone contact or date of non-CV death.

Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to summarize the time to the first event of the primary endpoint.

The log-rank test, stratified by stratification variables at randomization (CV risk category, use of

ezetimibe, and geographical region) was used to compare the time-to-event between treatment

groups. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing the two treatment groups along with the 95% confidence

interval (CI) were calculated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

The 2 sided alpha level for the primary analysis was adjusted to 0.0437 from 0.05 to account for the

two interim analyses based on a group sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries generated

using the Lan DeMets alpha-spending function. The interim analysis results of the study were

monitored by an independent DMC.

The time to first occurrence of each of the five component events of the primary endpoint, each of the

secondary endpoints, and time-to-event tertiary endpoints were analyzed by the same methods

described for the primary endpoint.

For the analysis of all secondary endpoints, the Type 1 error was controlled by testing each endpoint

sequentially, starting with the key secondary endpoint. Testing was done at a significance level of

0.0437 consistent with that used for the primary endpoint.

Subgroup analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints were performed as described for the

primary endpoint. Subgroup analyses results are presented in forest plots. A p-value for testing the

interaction terms <0.15 was considered significant.

As a sensitivity analysis, alternative censoring rules were applied. In addition, recurrent event analysis

was performed considering events as count data, a stratified Cox proportional hazards model was

constructed for the primary endpoint to evaluate the treatment effect adjusting for important baseline

covariates, and tipping point analyses were performed to assess the potential impact of missing data

that were caused by early termination from the study.

For measurements of lipids, lipoproteins, and inflammatory markers, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was

used for treatment comparisons of the percent change from baseline, and medians and quartiles were

provided for each treatment group. The medians of the differences between the treatment groups and

95% CIs were estimated with the Hodges-Lehman method. In addition, shift tables were generated.

Australia, and New Zealand). There were two patients (both in the Netherlands) inadvertently

randomized twice, each under two separate patient numbers. Patient 19-716-037 was later

randomized as 19-725-089 and Patient 19-735-004 was later randomized as 19-735-013.
#### **Outcomes and estimation **

**Primary Endpoint Analysis**

5-fold MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularisation, unstable angina

caused by myocardial ischemia and associated with emergent hospitalisation.

The results of the analysis of the primary endpoint are summarized in Table 11-5 for the ITT

population, and the associated Kaplan-Meier curve is displayed in Figure 11-1. The median follow-up

duration for the primary endpoint was 4.7 and 4.5 years for the AMR101 and placebo groups,

respectively.

A primary endpoint event occurred in 17.2% (705/4089) of patients in the AMR101 group, as

compared with 22.0% (901/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.752 [95% CI: 0.682 to

0.830; p=0.00000001]; relative risk reduction [RRR] of 24.8% and number needed to treat [NNT] of

**Key Secondary Composite Endpoint Analysis**

The key secondary composite endpoint was the time from randomization to the first occurrence of the

composite of CV death, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), or nonfatal stroke (i.e., hard MACE endpoint).

The results of the analysis of the key secondary endpoint are summarized in Table 11-6 for the ITT

population, and the associated Kaplan-Meier curve is displayed in Figure 11-2. The median follow-up

duration for the key secondary endpoint was 4.8 and 4.7 years for the AMR101 and placebo groups,

respectively. A key secondary endpoint event occurred in 11.2% (459/4089) of patients in the AMR101

group, as compared with 14.8% (606/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.735 [95% CI:

0.651 to 0.830; p=0.0000006]; RRR of 26.5% and NNT of 28).

**Individual Components of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints**

A forest plot of the analyses of the individual components of the primary and key secondary endpoints,

each analyzed as independent endpoints (e.g., time to first occurrence of nonfatal MI, regardless of the

time to first occurrence of any other endpoints for the same patient), is presented in Figure 11-3.

**Other Secondary Endpoint Analyses**

Other secondary endpoints were the time from randomization to the first occurrence of each of the

events described below. If the primary and key secondary endpoints were statistically significant, the

remaining secondary endpoints were to be tested in the hierarchical order as depicted in Figure 11-4.

All of these other secondary endpoint events occurred in a lower percentage of patients in the AMR101

group than in the placebo group. The results were statistically significant for each secondary endpoint

event, with the exception of total mortality, the final secondary endpoint in the hierarchy.

(87/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.69 [95% CI: 0.50 to 0.96]).

Lipids and other Biomarkers

The effects on plasma biomarkers from baseline to years 1 or 2 are presented in Table 11-13. Plasma

TG, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, and EPA were measured at Year 1; apo B and hsCRP were measured at

Year 2. TG levels over time are presented in Figure 11-7 (ITT).

In the placebo arm some of these markers showed a trend to a numerical deterioration. Small

numerical increases were observed for TG (+ 4.5 mg/dL), non-HDL-C (+ 12.0 mg/dL), LDL-C (+ 7.0

/+ 9.3 mg/dL (depending on the mode of calculation), apoB (+ 6.0 mg/dL), and hsCRP (+0.5 mg/L).

Significant reductions were observed with AMR101 compared to placebo in TG, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo

B, and hsCRP. The effect on TGs was maximal at visit 3 and persisted up to the endo of the study.

In the AMR101 group, median percent decreases from baseline in approximated LDL-C (Hopkins) were

observed at each time point assessed, with the difference from placebo being significant at each time

point. Median percent change in approximated LDL-C (Hopkins) from baseline to one year was -1.2%

(-1.1 mg/dL) for the AMR101 group and 10.9% (9.3 mg/dL) for the placebo group, for a median

difference in percent change from baseline of -11.4% (Hodges- Lehmann estimate; p<0.0001).

Median percent change in approximated LDL-C (Hopkins) from baseline to the last study value was 
1.2% (-1.0 mg/dL) for the AMR101 group and 6.5% (5.7 mg/dL) for the placebo group, for a median

difference in percent change from baseline of -7.4% (Hodges-Lehmann estimate; p<0.0001).

27.0 (22.4, 34.2) in the AMR101 group and increased from 31.0 (26.7, 36.9) to 32.8 (26.2, 40.9) in

the mineral oil group: Treatment difference -5.2 ((-5.6, -4.8) p <.0001).

hsTnT (High-sensitivity troponin) was 0.0 (0.0; 0.0) in both arms at baseline and at visit 4 (Table

Recurrent event analyses

Total CV events analysis was defined as the time from randomization to occurrence of the first and all

recurrent major CV events, defined as CV death, nonfatal MI (including silent MI), nonfatal stroke,

coronary revascularization, or unstable angina determined to be caused by myocardial ischemia by

invasive/non-invasive testing and requiring emergent hospitalization. A summary of total events in the

primary and key secondary endpoints, including recurrent events on the same day, is presented in

#### **Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) **

The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial (REDUCE-IT). No analyses were provided across

trials. This is appropriate. ***Supportive studies ***

Two supportive studies were provided. Both studies aimed at investigating the effect of AMR101 at 2

doses (2gr daily and 4 gr daily, administered BID with wood in comparison with a placebo containing

mineral oil) on lipid parameters and other parameters relevant for the characterisation of CV risk of

patients.

**AMR101 MARINE Study (AMR-01-01-0016) NCT01047683**

**A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, 12-Week Study**

**With an Open-Label Extension to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of AMR101 in Patients**

**With Fasting Triglyceride Levels** ≥ **500 mg/dL and** ≤ **2000 mg/dL:**

It was a multi-center, international, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 3 arm, double

blind study. The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of AMR101 2 g daily and

4 g daily, compared to placebo, in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with fasting TG levels ≥ 500

mg/dL and ≤ 2000 mg/dL ( ≥ 5.6 mmol/L and ≤ 22.6 mmol/L). It included a

- 6- to 8-week screening/washout period (which included a diet and lifestyle stabilization period and a

TG qualifying period),

- a 12-week double-blind treatment period (AMR101 2 g daily, AMR101 4 g daily, or placebo) and a

- 40-week open-label extension (OLE) period. All patients were to receive open-label AMR101 4 g daily.

From Visit 7 (Week 12) until the end of the study, changes to the lipid-altering regimen were permitted

(e.g., initiating, restarting, or raising the dose of statin or adding/restarting non-statin, lipid-altering

medications), as guided by standard practice and prescribing information. After Visit 8 (Week 16),

patients were to return to the site every 12 weeks until the last visit at Visit 11 (Week 52).

For methods and results of the OLE see below. The study design is depicted in Figure 1. Of the 229

patients assigned randomly to treatment, 76 were assigned to the placebo group, 76 were assigned to

the AMR101 2 g group, and 77 were assigned to the AMR101 4 g group. Fourteen (6.1%) patients

discontinued from the double-blind treatment period: 7 (3.1%) patients withdrew consent, 4 (1.7%)

patients due to an adverse event, 2 (0.9%) patients with TG >2000 mg/dL, and 1 (0.4%) patient was

lost to follow-up.

**AMR101 ANCHOR Study (AMR-01-01-0017)**


**A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, 12-Week Study to**


**Evaluate the Effect of Two Doses of AMR101 on Fasting Serum Triglyceride Levels in**

**Patients With Persistent High Triglyceride Levels (** ≥ **200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) Despite**

**Statin Therapy:**


**The AMR101 ANCHOR Study**


This Phase 3, multi-center study consisted of a 6- to 8-week screening/washout period (which included

a diet and lifestyle stabilization period and an LDL-C and TG qualifying period) and a 12-week double
blind treatment period (AMR101 2 g daily, AMR101 4 g daily, or placebo).

The screening period included a 4- to 6-week diet and lifestyle stabilization period and washout period

followed by a 2-week LDL-C and TG qualifying period. Patients taking non-statin, lipid-altering

medications (niacin >200 mg daily, fibrates, fish oil, other products containing omega-3 fatty acids, or

other herbal products or dietary supplements with potential lipid-altering effects) at the time of

screening must have been able to safely discontinue them at screening. At the end of the 4-week diet

and lifestyle stabilization period or the 6-week diet and stabilization and washout period, eligible

patients entered the 2-week LDL-C and TG qualifying period and had their fasting LDL-C and TG levels

measured at Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visit 3 (Week -1).

In order to enter the 12-week double-blind treatment period, patients must have had a mean fasting

LDL-C level ≥ 40 mg/dL and ≤ 115 mg/dL (based on 2 qualifying visits) and fasting TG levels from 2

qualifying visits within the following ranges:

`•` Mean of the 2 values ≥ 185 mg/dL and at least 1 value ≥ 200 mg/dL and

- Mean of the 2 values <500 mg/dL.

Approximately 216 patients per treatment group were to be randomized in this study. Patients were

stratified by type of statin (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin), the presence of diabetes, and

gender.

Figure 2 summarizes patient disposition during the double-blind treatment period. Of the 702 patients

assigned randomly to treatment, 233 were assigned to the AMR101 4 g group, 236 were assigned to

the AMR101 2 g group, and 233 were assigned to the placebo group. Thirty-nine (5.6%) patients

discontinued from the double-blind treatment period: 20 (2.8%) patients due to an adverse event, 12

(1.7%) patients withdrew consent, 2 (0.3%) patients were lost to follow-up, 1 patient (0.1%) with a

TG level >800 mg/dL, 1 (0.1%) patient due to investigator judgment, 1 (0.1%) patient died, and 2

(0.3%) patients withdrew for reasons other than those specified above. In total, 663 (94.4%) patients

completed the double-blind treatment period of the study: 221 (94.8%) patients in the AMR1101 4 g

group, 225 (95.3%) patients in the AMR101 2 g group, and 217 (93.1%) patients in the placebo

group.

The CHMP approved Vazkepa in the following indication:

*Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high*

*cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (* ≥ *150 mg/dL) and:*

*• established cardiovascular disease, or*

*• diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on*

*cardiovascular events see Section 5.1.*
##### ***Dose finding studies ***

Dose selection was based on the efficacy of Vazkepa in reducing TG levels as investigated in two

supportive controlled studies, ANCHOR and MARINE. Both were 3 arm, randomised, double-blind,

placebo controlled, multi-centre studies with a 12-week double-blind period. MARINE was followed by a

40-week open label extension study. TG reduction was the primary endpoint in both studies, additional

lipid parameters and serum markers were investigated as additional endpoints. In MARINE study,

patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (TG ≥ 5.6 and ≤ 22.6 mmol/L [ ≥ 500 and ≤ 2000 mg/dL]) while

in ANCHOR study patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (TG ≥ 2.3 and <5.6 mmol/L [ ≥ 200 and <500

mg/dL]) on statin therapy were included. In both studies 2 or 4 g/day Vazkepa or matching placebo

(mineral oil) taken bid with food was administered. The studies included an evaluation of the

correlation between EPA in plasma and red blood cells and the TG lowering effect at the two doses

selected. ***Main study REDUCE-IT ***

The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial the REDUCE IT trial. It was a Phase 3 randomised,

placebo controlled event (cardiovascular events) driven study in patients with moderately elevated TG

( ≥ 1.5 and <5.6 mmol/L [ ≥ 135 and <500 mg/dL], after amendment 1: ≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and

<500 mg/dL) on statin therapy and at high risk for CVD. Patients received 2 g of AMR101 twice daily

(BID) (4 g/day) or matching placebo (mineral oil).

The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of AMR101 compared to

placebo in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events (5 fold MACE: Composite of CV death, non
fatal MI (including silent MI), non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularisation, or unstable angina requiring

emergent hospitalisation). The key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to 3-fold MACE (CV death,

non-fatal MI (including silent MI), or non-fatal stroke) which is considered more relevant for the

assessment of efficacy. Additional secondary CV endpoints were analysed in a predefined hierarchical

order. Patients were included in two separate groups based on CV risk at baseline (intended ratio

70/30% Group 1/Group 2). CV Risk Category 1 (Secondary Prevention Cohort): men and women ≥ 45

years with documented coronary artery diseases (CAD), cerebrovascular or carotid disease, or

peripheral arterial disease (PAD). CV risk category 2 (Primary Prevention Cohort): Men and women ≥

50 years of age with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) and additional predefined risk factors

(smoker, higher age, hypertension, renal dysfunction, retinopathy, micro- or macroalbuminuria, or

Ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9 without symptoms). Randomization was stratified by CV risk category,

use of ezetimibe (yes/no), and by geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia

Pacific). Two protocol amendments were included after start of the study. The most relevant was the

introduction of patients with higher level of TG as an inclusion criterion.

Numbers planned and analysed: A total of approximately 7990 patients were planned to be enrolled

(i.e., randomized) in the study to either receive AMR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 3995

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 91/129


-----

patients per treatment group) to observe an estimated 1612 primary endpoint events. A total of 473

sites enrolled and/or followed patients in 11 countries in 3 geographic regions. A total of 19,212

patients were screened, 8179 patients were randomized/ 7314 completed the final visit (Vazkepa

4089/3684, Placebo 4090/3630). All efficacy analyses, including the primary analysis, were performed

on the ITT population.

The statistical methods are generally acceptable.

The study was planned and started before the concept of estimand was introduced by the ICH E9 (R1)

addendum on estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials. Nevertheless, although not explicitly

specified using estimand terminology, including data after discontinuation of study drug for patients

who discontinued study drug prematurely implies that a ‘treatment policy’ strategy was applied for the

intercurrent event treatment discontinuation, which is appropriate. Censoring patients for non-CV

death can either be seen as corresponding to targeting the hypothetical treatment effect that would

have been observed if no non-CV deaths had occurred (under a missing at random assumption), or to

targeting the effect while not having died for non-CV reasons. Both approaches have limitations

regarding relevance and interpretability. Therefore, the secondary endpoint including total mortality in

the composite endpoint instead of CV-death is of particular relevance.

The stratified log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model are standard methods for analysis

of time to event data, also taking the stratified randomisation adequately into account. However,

interpretation of the hazard ratio (HR) estimate resulting from the Cox model is not straightforward if

the proportional hazards assumption is not fulfilled.

The measures to ensure confidentiality of interim analyses results to preserve the integrity of the study

were adequate. The 95% confidence intervals that were calculated for the primary (and secondary)

endpoints are nominal confidence intervals that are not consistent with the group sequential design of

the study.

Sequential testing with alpha level 0.0437 does not necessarily ensure control of the family-wise type

1 error for secondary endpoints: The alpha level 0.0437 for final analysis was determined based on the

information fractions (proportion of events) for the primary endpoint at the interim analyses, which are

not the same as for the secondary endpoints. However, taking the actual results (p-values) into

account, this is not considered an issue.

The sensitivity analyses cover adequately the assessment of analysis assumptions, as well as some

sensitivity analyses target additional treatment effects of interest (estimands).

Overall the study was well conducted as planned, no concerns regarding compliance with GCP were

detected during the assessment.
##### ***Efficacy data and additional analyses ***

In the REDUCE-IT study a daily dose of AMR101 of 4 g (2 g BID with food) was investigated. No data

are available on the correlation between dose and efficacy on hard CV clinical endpoints.

The dose selection was mainly based on results from ANCHOR and MARINE/MARINE OLE. Prior to

MARINE and ANCHOR, more than 1000 patients had been exposed to AMR101 at doses up to 4 g per

day in the randomised, double-blind periods of Amarin-sponsored studies. ANCHOR and MARINE

studies investigated efficacy of two dose levels (1 and 2 g BID, i.e. 2g and 4 g daily dose taken with

food). MARINE OLE was an open label extension study investigating a daily dose of AMR101 4 g over

40 weeks. In these studies AMR 101 resulted in statistically significant reductions of TG compared with

placebo. A larger reduction in TG and other lipid, lipoprotein, and inflammatory markers was seen with

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 92/129


-----

AMR101 4 g/day than with AMR101 2 g/day. Data on PK/PD correlation based on these two doses were

provided in ANCHOR and MARINE showing a correlation between dose, percent change in EPA levels in

plasma end red blood cells and TG lowering effect. In addition, a post hoc analysis indicating a

correlation between clinical outcome and EPA exposure in REDUCE-IT was provided.

Based on these considerations the choice of the 4 g daily AMR101 dose (2 g bid with food) in REDUCE
IT appears to be reasonable, although the contribution of the TG lowering effect to efficacy is unclear.

While information about efficacy of lower doses on CV endpoints is missing, not including a lower dose

treatment arm in the REDUCE-IT trial is not a key issue of concern in terms of efficacy.

The patient characteristics were balanced between the 2 treatment arms. Overall, the majority of

patients were male (71.2% [5822/8179]) and white (90.2% [7379/8179]). The mean age of patients

was 63.4 years (range 44 to 92 years), with 46.0% (3763/8179) of patients aged ≥ 65 years. Mean

height, weight, and BMI were 171.3 cm, 93.0 kg, and 31.6 kg/m2, respectively. 22.2% (1816/8179) of

patients were renally impaired at baseline (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2). 69.1% of the patients had

prior atherosclerotic CV disease, most of these had CAD (58.4%), and history of MI (46.7%).

The most common incidences of reported CV disease history or other prior conditions influencing CV

risk were hypertension (86.6% [7084/8179]), Type 2 diabetes (57.8% [4730/8179]), and MI (46.7%

[3819/8179]). The most common incidences of reported CV disease history or other prior conditions

influencing CV risk were hypertension (86.6% [7084/8179]), Type 2 diabetes (57.8% [4730/8179]),

and MI (46.7% [3819/8179]). Only few patients with T1DM were included.

**Primary efficacy result**

Primary endpoint: 5-fold MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularisation,

unstable angina caused by myocardial ischemia and associated with emergent hospitalisation. A

primary endpoint event occurred in 17.2% (705/4089) of patients in the AMR101 group, as compared

with 22.0% (901/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.752 [95% CI: 0.682 to 0.830;

p=0.00000001]; relative risk reduction [RRR] of 24.8% and number needed to treat [NNT] of 21). The

median follow-up duration for the primary endpoint was 4.7 and 4.5 years for the AMR101 and placebo

groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference was seen after 1 year between the treatment

arms. All 5 components of the primary composite endpoint contributed to the overall statistically

significant result. In a landmark analysis a significantly lower risk of major adverse CV events with

AMR101 than with placebo (HR of 0.799 [95% CI: 0.693 to 0.920; p=0.0017]) was observed at the 2
year landmark.

**Key secondary composite endpoint analysis (3-fold MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal**

**stroke)**

The key secondary endpoint is considered most important for the assessment of efficacy. The median

follow-up duration for the key secondary endpoint was 4.8 and 4.7 years for the AMR101 and placebo

groups, respectively. A key secondary endpoint event occurred in 11.2% (459/4089) of patients in the

AMR101 group, as compared with 14.8% (606/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.735

[95% CI: 0.651 to 0.830; p=0.0000006]; RRR of 26.5% and NNT of 28). Similar to the primary

endpoint result, there was a lag time of about 1.5 years before differences between the groups became

apparent.

**Results for the individual components of the primary and key secondary endpoint**

All components contributed to the overall result (results for first event in each class are shown,

AMR101 vs. placebo, events (%), HR (95% CI), p value)):

  - CV death: 174 (4.3%) vs. 213 (5.2%), HR 0.803 (0.657, 0.981, p = 0.03),

Assessment report

-----

  - Nonfatal myocardial infarction: 237 (5.8%) vs. 332 (8.1%), HR 0.697 (0.590; 0.823, p <

0.0001),

  - Nonfatal stroke: 85 (2.1%) vs. 118 (2.9%), HR 0.708 (0.536, 0.936, p = 0.01),

  - Coronary revascularisation: 376 (9.2%) vs. 544 (13.3%), HR 0.664 (0.583 0.758, p <

0.0001),

  - Hospitalization for unstable angina: 108 (2.6%) vs. 157 (3.8%), HR 0.679 (0.531, 0.868, p =

0.002).

**Other secondary endpoints**

Statistically significant reductions in time to event (first event, ITT) were observed for the following

secondary endpoints (predefined hierarchical testing): CV death or nonfatal MI; fatal of nonfatal MI;

urgent or emergent revascularization; CV death; hospitalization for unstable angina; fatal or nonfatal

stroke; total mortality, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke (AMR101 vs. placebo, events (%), HR (95% CI),

p value): 549 (13.4%) vs. 690 (16.9%), HR 0.772 (0.690, 0.864, p <.0001). For total mortality the

numerical difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance: 274 (6.7%) vs. 310

(7.6%), HR 0.870 (0.739, 1.023) p = 0.0915.

Overall, the results for the primary endpoint were consistent for most of the predefined subgroups.

Region, Ezetimibe use, Sex, hsCRP, eGFR, LDL-C, HDL-C, Apo-B, Non-HDL-C and Triglycerides at

baseline had no significant impact on efficacy as determined by the primary endpoint. A significant p

value for interaction was observed for age < 65 and ≥ 65 years with lower efficacy at the higher age

group.

Although not significant (p value for interaction 0.1388), overall efficacy tended to be lower in the

primary prevention cohort:

Primary prevention: 146/1197 (12.2%) vs. 163/1197 (13.6%), HR 0.876 (0.700, 1.095)

Secondary Prevention: 559/2892 (19.3%) vs. 738/2893 (25.5%), HR 0.726 (0.650, 0.810)

Post hoc exploratory analyses indicated relevant efficacy in patients at high and very high CV risk.

Efficacy in cohort 2 was less clear in patients with less than three risk factors and at lower age (below

55/65 years m/f). These patients overall had a lower CV risk. As over-interpretation of exploratory

analyses needs to be avoided, such analyses were not specifically included in the wording of the

indication. A statement in the wording of the indication that patients should be “at high cardiovascular

risk” sufficiently covers uncertainties around efficacy in such patients at lower baseline risk. The

applicant has amended the proposed indication accordingly.

Results for additional tertiary composite CV composites combining CV death and other CV events and

of several additional tertiary endpoints were consistent with the results for the primary and key

secondary analysis.

Cardiac arrhythmia events requiring hospitalization of ≥ 24 hours occurred in 4.6% (188/4089) of

patients in the AMR101 group, as compared with 3.8% (154/4090) of patients in the placebo group

(HR of 1.21 [95% CI: 0.97 to 1.49]). **Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter** events requiring

hospitalization of ≥ 24 hours occurred in 3.1% (127/4089) of patients in the AMR101 group, as

compared with 2.1% (84/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 1.50 [95% CI: 1.14 to 1.98] p

= 0.0037).

Plasma TG, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, and EPA were measured at Year 1; apo B and hsCRP were

measured at Year 2. In the placebo arm some of these markers showed a trend to a numerical

-----

deterioration. Small numerical increases were observed for TG (+ 4.5 mg/dL), non-HDL-C (+ 12.0

mg/dL), LDL-C (+ 7.0 /+ 9.3 mg/dL (depending on the mode of calculation)), apo B (+ 6.0 mg/dL),

and hsCRP (+0.5 mg/L). Significant reductions were observed with AMR101 compared to placebo in

TG, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apo B, and hsCRP. The effect on TGs was maximal at visit 3 and persisted up

to the end of the study.

A key issue discussed with the Applicant is **the potentially negative impact of the comparator**

(mineral oil) on CV events. The mechanism of action of AMR101 is not entirely clear. TG lowering

therapy has not consistently been associated with a parallel reduction in CV events in the past and it is

conceivable that multiple mechanisms of action contribute to the difference in the event rate between

the AMR101 and the placebo arm. Mineral oil (paraffin oil) was chosen as placebo, but it is not clear

that mineral oil in fact is entirely inert. Some of the markers relevant for prognosis showed a trend

toward deterioration in the mineral oil arm. Small numerical increases were observed for TG, non-HDL
C, LDL-C, apoB, and hsCRP. Change from baseline in systolic BP showed a small difference between

the groups. To which degree this just represented the natural course of the disease, was due to

variability and regression of the mean effects or represented a negative effect of mineral oil is not

entirely clear.

In a first step a worst-case scenario was proposed to identify the maximally conceivable negative

impact of the comparator in order to assess whether under such assumptions efficacy remained

clinically relevant. The scenario was based on the following assumptions as derived from associations

as published: an increase in LDL-C by 7 – 9.3 mg/dl may translate into an increase in MACE events by

about 4 – 5%. An increase in Apo B by 6.0 mg/dL may translate into an increase in CAD by about 5%,

and in major cardiovascular disease risk by 4%. An increase in hsCRP by 0.5 mg may translate into an

increase by 4 – 5% in ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease and an increase by 11% in vascular

deaths. A difference in systolic blood pressure by 0.6 – 1.5 mmHg may translate into a difference in CV

event rates by about 2%. Based on the worst-case assumption that all of these effects were

independent, additive and due to mineral oil, CV events increased by at the most 15%. However, it is

clear that this scenario is largely over-pessimistic. E.g. the impact of LDL-C and ApoB on CV outcome

are not additive but overlapping. It was further assumed that all of the changes vs. baseline were due

to mineral oil and did not represent the natural course of the disease or design features of the study.

Such an assumption may also not hold true. Some studies indicate that the predictive value of hsCRP

for CV events may be lower in patients on statin treatment than in statin naïve patients. However, for

hsCRP the worst-case scenario was based on data from the emerging risk factors collaborations that

were adjusted for several CV risk factors including cholesterol levels. It is acknowledged that there is

considerable uncertainty about the predictive value for the specific group of patients included in

REDUCE-IT and it is most likely not appropriate just to add the presumed hsCRP associated risk to the

LDL-C/ApoB associated risk. The small effect on blood pressure may be additive on its own. When

taking the overlap of LDL-C and Apo-B into account the possible negative impact is very likely to be

smaller than about 10%. This would translate into a Vazkepa mediated RRR on MACE (3 point MACE)

events of more than 16.5%, which clearly is clinically relevant. Even this assumption is likely to be

over-pessimistic. In the Amarin sponsored studies, increases in LDL-C were only seen in those two

studies with an upper threshold for LDL-C as an inclusion criterion indicating the possibility of

regression to the mean effects rather than true PD effects. Increases in LDL-C have also been observed

in the control arms in other studies not using mineral oil as a comparator where upper limits of LDL-C

were among the selection criteria. Therefore, the observed increase in LDL-C may have been at least in

part due to the design of REDUCE-IT. Furthermore, as outlined by the Applicant, the hypothetical

worst-case scenario does not take into account that there were also beneficial effects in the mineral oil

arm (increase in HDL-C) that could counterbalance a putative negative effect.

-----

The Applicant has provided covariate-based analyses of the study results. These analyses indicated for

most of the biomarkers a much lower impact on CV outcome than estimated based on population
based association data from the literature. Based on these calculations the applicant concluded that

the possible effect of mineral oil on biomarkers should not make up for more than 0.3 - 3% of CV

events (3-point MACE).

It is worth considering that mineral oil may interact with the absorption of drugs like statins that are

relevant for the CV prevention. Effects on the absorption of antihypertensive drugs, non VIT K

anticoagulants or thrombocyte inhibitors are unknown. The Applicant provided additional analyses

indicating that efficacy of statins and of anticoagulants was not related to physicochemical properties

of the drugs which would have been expected if mineral oil had a relevant impact on absorption.

Bleeding patterns were also not related to physicochemical properties of anticoagulants or antiplatelet

drugs. However, the latter analyses were hampered by the relevant increase in bleeding with Vazkepa

and a pronunciation of bleeding events when Vazkepa was concomitantly administered with

anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. The issue is further discussed in the safety part.

The Applicant claimed that there was **a correlation between EPA levels and CV outcome** further

supporting the assumption of a treatment related effect. Analyses of the data as provided initially

indicated that those patients on active treatment that did not achieve EPA levels above 100 μg/mL

(about 1/3 of the patients) had a considerably higher rate of CV events than patients on placebo. This

unexpected observation was sufficiently explained by an inappropriate definition of imputation rules

assuming that steady state was not reached before the first measurement of EPA blood concentrations

(usually at year 1). When changing this assumption in line with PK data indicating that steady state is

reached by about day 14 the negative apparent imbalance disappeared. Low EPA blood levels in almost

30% of patients on treatment could at least in part be explained by a lower compliance. In these

patients the MACE event rate was not different from the event rate in the overall placebo group.

Taking the uncertainties about missing data, sparse sampling and the high impact of the definition of

imputation rules on the results into account, the analyses indicating an association between EPA

concentrations and efficacy are not considered robust.

In summary, for the key secondary analysis (3-point MACE) Vazkepa showed a risk reduction by

26.5% when compared to mineral oil. Upon request, the potential negative impact of mineral oil on CV

outcome has been analysed by the Applicant in detail. Whether the assumption of the Applicant of a

potential negative effect of mineral oil on CV outcome (MACE) of up to 0.3 - 3% holds true or a higher

value may be more realistic that – in a worst case scenatio - is not above 10% in a worst case

scenario, the remaining benefit of Vazkepa on CV outcome remains unambiguously clinically relevant.

Even under very conservative assumptions, treatment with Vazkepa was associated with a risk

reduction for MACE (3 point MACE) of at least 16.5%. This worst-case scenario may considerably

overestimate a putative negative impact of long term treatment with mineral oil on CV events.

After amending the wording of the indication by including reference to high CV risk and specifying age

as a CV risk factor in section 5.1 in the study description the proposed target population appropriately

reflects the study population with respect to baseline cardiovascular (CV) risk and triglyceride (TG)

levels, for which a positive benefit-risk balance has been demonstrated. According to the Applicant´s

calculations based on the placebo event rate the average 10 year risk for CV death was 12.2% in the

overall study population. This indicates that overall patients in REDUCE-IT were not only at high risk ( ≥

5% and <10% for 10-year risk of fatal CVD) but a substantial proportion was even at very high risk ( ≥

10% for 10-year risk of fatal CVD, according to 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of

dyslipidaemias, European Heart Journal (2020) 41, 111 – 188, Table 4). Regarding patients in Risk

category 1 the cited guideline considers all patients with documented ASCVD as having a very high

risk.

EMA/145271/2021 Page 96/129


-----

For patients in Risk category 2 (“primary prevention”) the calculated risk for CV death was 8.3%.

Analyses provided indicated that a large number of these patients were also at a very high risk since

several inclusion criteria for risk category 2 were in line with the above-mentioned ESC definitions for

very high risk. (e.g. DM with target organ damage” or patients with diabetes and another major risk

factors). Analyses provided indicated that absolute risk reduction was lower in patients at high risk

than in those at very high risk, but relative efficacy of Vazkepa was similar in both groups.

The applicant stated that reference to “statin-treated patients” would better reflect inclusion criteria

than reference to “maximally tolerated” statin therapy which was initially requested by the CHMP in

line with the recommendations of clinical guidelines. This is acceptable.

Additional analyses indicated that hsCRP had a prognostic and a positive predictive value in this

context and therefore is appropriate as a risk factor to be included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

The outcome and the final letters of the FDA based inspections have been provided, sensitivity

analyses provided by excluding data at one center with some findings of the FDA indicated that

inclusion of these data did not have an impact on the overall results.
#### **2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy **

The CHMP considers the application is acceptable from the clinical efficacy viewpoint. ***2.6. Clinical safety ***

Safety information regarding use of Vazkepa in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and high

cardiovascular risk mainly comes from the pivotal Phase 3 study, REDUCE-IT, (Reduction of

Cardiovascular Events with EPA – Intervention Trial; AMR-01-01-0019), which provides substantial

evidence of the safety of Vazkepa in the proposed target patient population, i.e. statin-treated patients

with elevated TG (fasting TG ≥135 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) and high CV risk. Supportive evidence of

the safety of Vazkepa in a relevant patient population is provided from the two Phase 3 studies:

patients with hypertriglyceridemia and with persistent high fasting TG levels (≥200 and <500 mg/dL)

despite statin therapy [ANCHOR (AMR-01-01-0017)], and patients with very high (≥500 mg/dL and

≤2000 mg/dL fasting TG levels [MARINE (AMR-01-01-0016)] (Table 1).

Additional safety data come from the two Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects

(LA01.01.0009 and AMR-01-01-0018, Table 1) and three completed DDI studies (AMR-01-01-0020,

AMR-01-01-0021, and AMR-01-01-0023).

In addition, eight clinical studies have been conducted in patients with central nervous system (CNS)

disorders (three in Huntington’s disease, three in depressions, one in memory impairment, and one in

schizophrenia).

In the REDUCE-IT trial, the median duration of Vazkepa and placebo treatment was 1614 days (4.5

years) and 1512 days (4.2 years), respectively. Overall, 12.3% (1010/8179) of patients received study

drug for <1 year (i.e., <360 days) and 0.5% (37/8179) of patients received study drug for ≥6 years

(≥2160 days); see table below.

In the pooled hypertriglyceridemia phase 2 studies, mean exposure was 82 days (median 84 days) in

all treatment groups, plc, Vazkepa 2g/d and Vazkepa 4g/d. For around 35% of the patients, treatment

duration was more than 84 days. Total exposure was 69 subject-years in the plc and 70 subj-y. in each

Vazkepa group (2 g and 4 g). ***Adverse events ***

**Overview**

The following table provides an overview of AEs observed in the REDUCE-IT trial. The incidence of AEs

and SAEs was rather high, but this was obviously due to underlying disease since there were no

relevant differences between the Vazkepa and plc group in the frequency of all AEs or SAEs. This is

also true for all sub-categories (drug-related AE, AE leading to discontinuation etc.).

TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event.
Note: A TEAE was defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severity on or after the date
of dispensing study drug and within 30 days after the completion or withdrawal from study.
Percentages were based on the number of patients randomised to each treatment group in the Safety
population (N). Events that were positively adjudicated as clinical endpoints were not included.
1 Study drug related TEAE include those characterised as related, probably related, or possibly
related.
2 Withdrawal of study drug excludes patients who were off drug but remained in the study for 30
days or more and restarted study drug.

The applicant also provided a pooled safety analysis of the two smaller studies in hypertriglyceridemia

patients, ANCHOR and MARINE, see table below. The incidence of AEs was lower than in REDUCE-IT,

probably because of the shorter study duration. All AEs, related AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation

were numerically slightly more frequent in the plc group. Serious AEs were numerically more frequent

in the Vazkepa group, but the number of events was low so that no firm conclusions can be drawn.

Salient numerical imbalances among less frequent AEs in the REDUCE-IT trial are compiled in the

following two tables (taken from Table 14.3.1.2.7 of CSR); the upper table shows events which were

more frequent with Vazkepa and the lower shows AEs which were more frequent in the plc group.

Beside supraventricular arrhythmias, Vazkepa increased the frequency of events of cardiac conduction

disorders, hyperuricemia/gout, skin-related AEs and allergic conditions. The latter difference was

mainly driven by the term “Hypersensitivity”; no further information is available.

In the plc group, a salient numerical increase in events of hyperglycaemia was observed. Furthermore,

electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia), ventricular arrhythmias, anaemia,

hypothyroidism and intestine polyp were more frequent with plc than with Vazkepa.

In the two smaller studies in hypertriglyceridemia patients, ANCHOR and MARINE more patients in the

Vazkepa than in the plc group had an event of arthralgia. Vice versa, UTI and GI disorders were more

frequent in the plc group.

**Safety information from published studies**

In the Japan Eicosapentaenoic Acid Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), a large randomised trial, revealed

a higher incidence of adverse events (AEs); skin and gastrointestinal disorders, and haemorrhage

(cerebral; fundal; epistaxis; subcutaneous) in the icosapent ethyl group than in the control group

(statin alone). The incidence of pain was decreased in the icosapent ethyl group. The number of

laboratory abnormal values was higher in the icosapent ethyl group than in the control group, with a

slightly higher incidence of increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values (0.6% versus 0.4%,

p=0.03).

In addition, five published clinical studies with icosapent ethyl in other therapeutic areas (psychological

distress, depression, schizophrenia and dyslexia) were identified. In general, TEAE associated with

icosapent ethyl were mild gastrointestinal events that were not considered serious. One severe TEAE

was reported in a diabetic patient. This patient had an allergic reaction attributed to icosapent ethyl,

which was given as a supplement, and was characterised by a skin rash that was considered severe

and resulted in discontinuation.

**AEs of special interest**

***Bleeding***

Doses of omega-3 marine oil in excess of 3 g daily have been linked with an increase in bleeding time.

According to the applicant, these increases in bleeding time did not exceed normal limits.

Therefore, the applicant performed an analysis of bleeding-related AEs in the REDUCE-IT trial.

A statistically significantly higher incidence of bleeding events occurred in the Vazkepa group than in

the placebo group (11.8% [482/4089] versus 9.9% [404/4090], respectively; p=0.0055). Serious

bleeding events did not reach significance but trended toward higher incidence in the Vazkepa group

versus the placebo group (2.7% [111/4089] versus 2.1% [85/4090], respectively; p=0.0605), while

the rates of adjudicated haemorrhagic stroke were numerically different across treatment groups

(0.49% vs. 0.29%, EPA vs. plc), this difference did not reach statistical significance. The incidences of

serious GI bleeding, serious CNS bleeding, and serious anaemia were low overall and similar between

the Vazkepa and placebo groups; see table below.

|||||



1 Bleeding-related disorders were identified by the SMQs of “Gastrointestinal haemorrhage,” “Central
Nervous System haemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions,” and “Haemorrhage terms (excl
laboratory terms).”

SAEs of bleeding in the REDUCE-IT study were further analysed. Overall, 2.7% of patients in the

Vazkepa group and 2.1% of patients in the plc group had at least one SAE of bleeding. In most cases

(1.5% Vasc. 1.1% plc) the serious bleeding occurred in the GI tract. Serious CNS bleeding was less

frequent, 0.34% vs. 0.24%.

Since bleeding rate can be affected by concomitant medication, the applicant provided a summary of

background medication. The use of all substance classes antiplatelet drugs was well balanced between

the treatment groups; most important, this is also true for antiplatelet drugs. Thus, imbalances in

baseline medication cannot be responsible for the increased bleeding risk in the Vazkepa group.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 103/129


-----

In order to address bleeding tendency also in the phase 2 trials performed in patients with

hypertriglyceridemia, the applicant compiled all AEs which could indicate increased bleeding risk. An

markedly increased incidence in the Vazkepa group was observed for anaemia (0.8% vs. 0, Vazkepa.

vs. plc) and traumatic heamatoma (0.5% vs. 0). Notably, patients in the plc group more often took

anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication than in the Vazkepa group.

***Atrial fibrillation*** *(post hoc evaluation)*

Although not pre-specified as TEAE of special interest, atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter were

explored, based on a treatment imbalance observed in the study. A summary of TEAE and SAE of atrial

fibrillation/flutter is presented in the table below, along with positively adjudicated endpoints of atrial

fibrillation/flutter requiring hospitalisation of ≥24 hours (endpoint events adjudicated by the Clinical

Endpoint Committee [CEC]) as a comprehensive compilation of all documented post-randomisation

occurrences of these atrial arrhythmias. Also positively adjudicated events were more frequent with

Vazkepa than with plc (3.1% and 2.1% of patients in the Vazkepa and plc group, respectively).

Reassuringly, the number of patients with serious events was low and was fairly balanced between the

treatment groups.

#### ***Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events ***

**Deaths**

Total mortality was lower in the Vazkepa group (274 subjects [6.7%] vs. 310 subjects [7.6%]); this

was due to a decrease in CV mortality. For detailed discussion, see efficacy section.

**Other SAEs**

The total number of patients with an SAE was essentially equal in both treatment group, Vazkepa and

plc, of the REDUCE-IT trial. Accordingly, no major differences became obvious in the incidences of

SAEs affecting specific organ classes. In the smaller trials ANCHOR and MARINE, more patients in the

Vazkepa than in the plc group experienced at least one SAEs, but the absolute number of events was

low (18 subjects [2.9%] vs. 5 subjects [1.6%], Vazkepa vs. plc) so that no firm conclusions can be

drawn.

#### ***Laboratory findings ***

**Haematology**

After around one year of treatment, the median haemoglobin values slightly increased in the patients

of the Vazkepa group of REDUCE-IT as compared to plc patients; the difference between the groups

did not further increase after around three years of treatment, see figure below.

**Figure 12-1 of CSR: Plot of Median Haemoglobin Over Time (Safety Population)**

In accordance with the median increase in Hb in the Vazkepa group, a lower number of events of Hb

below LLN and a higher number of events of Hb above ULN was observed in this group, see table

below. This table is taken from a shift analysis indicating how many study participants had altered

values while having had normal basal values and vice versa. As an example, Visit 7 (after around 4

year’s treatment) is shown since at this time point the number of patients on treatment was still

sufficiently high (around 2400 per group) for meaningful conclusions.

**Serum chemistry**

In the following, the salient findings of serum chemistry in the REDUCE-IT study will be presented;

furthermore, liver parameters will be shown since special emphasis was laid on them by the applicant

to exclude events of drug-induced liver injury (DILI, so-called Hy’s law cases). For completeness, also

lipid parameters and inflammation markers will be mentioned although these were regarded as

(tertiary) endpoints in the efficacy analysis.

***Triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, apo-B, CRP (from efficacy analysis)***

There was a sharp decline in median serum triglyceride (TG) level within the first half year of

treatment in the Vascspa group; thereafter, the median values remained rather constant and were

below the median values of the plc group. LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) remained essentially constant over

time in the Vazkepa group and slightly increased within the first year of treatment in the plc group.

Median CRP and apo-B levels slightly decreased from baseline within the first two years of treatment in

the Vazkepa group. There was a more pronounced increase of these parameters in the plc group.

***Liver parameters***

There was no mean increase in serum ALT or AST levels in any treatment group. There were

numerically more patients with elevated ALT after four or five years of treatment in the Vazkepa than

in the plc group (868 [35%] and 742 [31%] cases in the Vazkepa and plc group, respectively after four

years; baseline ALT was normal in these cases).

Markedly more patients in the Vazkepa than in the plc group had elevated bilirubin after four to five

years of treatment, 205 [8.4%] vs. 67 [2.9%] subjects, Vazkepa vs. plc. This finding was paralleled by

a slight increase of mean serum bilirubin over time in the Vazkepa group and a more pronounced

decrease of bilirubin in the plc group, see table below (derived from Tables 14.3.4.3.1 and 14.3.4.3.2

of CSR).

|Bilirubin (µmol/L)|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
||Vazkepa|Plc|
|n|2444|2343|
|Mean (SD)|9.85 (5.182)|7.65 (3.887)|
|Change from Baseline:|||
|Mean (SD)|0.51 (3.757)|-1.75 (3.755)|
|Overall Post Baseline (low- normal-high at baseline)|||
|High|0-205-92|0-67-39|



***Potential Hy’s law cases***

An increase of 3 x ULN in ALT or AST and an increase of 2 x ULN in total bilirubin was reported in one

patient in each treatment group. An increase of 3 x ULN in ALT or AST, an increase of 2 x ULN in total

bilirubin, and a decrease of ≤2 x ULN in alkaline phosphatase was reported in one patient in the

Vazkepa group. During review of patient data in a blinded fashion over the course of the study, the

same two patients were determined to have potentially met Hy’s Law. For each patient, the elevated

liver enzymes were characterised as not related to study drug and were not considered to be drug
induced liver injury cases. In considering whether these laboratory measures qualified as Hy’s Law

cases, criteria were evaluated as outlined in the FDA Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury:

Premarketing Clinical Evaluation. According to the applicant, neither patient appear to have met all the

requirements for Hy’s Law.

***Other salient findings***

As above, measurements from Visit 7 (Day 1440, around four years of treatment) will be considered

because of still a rather high number of patients under treatment at this time point (see tables below).

Results from adjacent visits were similar. The values were taken from Tables 14.3.4.3.1 and 14.3.4.3.2

of CSR.

In the plc group, there was a marked mean increase over time in serum alkaline phosphatase (AP),

Accordingly, the number of subjects with values above ULN was higher in the plc group compared to

the Vazkepa group (396 subjects [16.8%] vs. 219 subjects [8.9%], plc vs. Vazkepa).

There was also a marked mean decrease from baseline in serum creatine kinase (CK) in the plc group

and a less pronounced mean increase in the Vazkepa group; accordingly, the number of subject with

CK above ULN was higher in the Vazkepa group.

A slightly higher number of subjects with increased sodium or urate levels was observed in the

Vazkepa compared to the plc group.

**Vital signs**

***Heart rate, blood pressure, ECG***

There were no relevant changes from baseline during the course of the study, and no meaningful

differences between the treatment groups (Vazkepa and plc) of REDUCE-IT were observed in respect

to heart rate, blood pressure and ECG parameters.

***Body weight***

The mean body weight of the participants slightly and steadily decreased during the course of the

REDUCE-IT study, by 1.1 kg in the Vazkepa group and 2.1 kg in the plc group after five years of

treatment in the safety population.
#### ***Safety in special populations ***

**Age:**

The applicant provided a safety evaluation stratified by the age categories <65 and ≥65 years. The

percentage of patients experiencing at least one TEAE was generally larger in the elder subgroup as

expected, but no relevant differences between the treatment groups became obvious.

**Renal insufficiency:**

In patients with renal impairment (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m [2] (see table below), a similar frequency of

treatment emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) was observed with Vazkepa (40.2%) compared to

placebo (39.3%). There were no drug-related SAEs for Vazkepa, versus one for placebo. Frequencies

of drug-related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to withdrawal of study drug, SAEs

leading to withdrawal of study drug, and SAEs leading to death were low and similar between the

Vazkepa and placebo treatment groups.

A review of the individual TEAEs and SAEs in the sub-group with eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73m [2] was

similar to the overall safety profile for the entire Safety Population. As would be expected, frequencies

of SAEs were higher in the sub-group with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] compared to subjects with ≥60

mL/min/1.73 m [2] . A review of SAEs by system organ class (SOC) did not reveal any SOC with a marked

imbalance between treatment groups for the sub-group of subjects with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] .

-----

Note: A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an event that first occurs or worsens
in severity on or after the date of dispensing study drug and within 30 days after the completion or
withdrawal from study.
Percentages are based on the number of subjects randomised to each treatment group in the ITT
population (N). Events that were positively adjudicated as clinical endpoints are not included.

[1] Drug-related TEAEs include those characterised as related, probably related, or possibly related.

[2] Withdrawal of study drug excludes subjects who were off drug in study (ODIS) for 30 days or
more, and restarted study drug.

**Hepatic impairment**

A total of 517 patients (269 in the Vazkepa an d 248 in the plc group) were identified in the REDUCE
IT study who had signs of liver disease at the time of recruitment. Assumption of liver disease was

based on history and on elevated serum liver parameters at baseline. A classification of the severity of

liver impairment, e.g. by the Child-Pugh-Score, was not performed.

No relevant imbalances in total AE incidence between Vazkepa and plc became obvious in the

subpopulation of subjects with hepatic disorders (222 subjects [82.5%] in the Vazkepa and 206

subjects [83.0%] in the plc group of this subpopulation suffered at least one TEAE). Regarding AEs per

organ class or specific types of AEs, the picture was similar to that observed in the whole study

population.
#### ***Immunological events ***

No special studies were performed. EPA is thought to affect inflammatory processes because it can

serve as a precursor for prostaglandins and leukotrienes. AEs related to allergic conditions were

numerically more frequent in the Vazkepa than in the plc group of the REDUCE-IT study (2.4% vs.

1.7%). Furthermore, dermatitis and eczema were numerically more frequent in the Vazkepa group

(3.6% vs. 2.9%). ***Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions ***

No studies on safety related to drug-drug interaction were performed. For potential PK interactions see

respective section above.

#### ***Discontinuation due to adverse events ***

Overall, 3.7% of study participants discontinued due to an AE. Discontinuation rate was slightly higher

in the plc (mineral oil) group than in the Vazkepa group, 4.0% vs. 3.4%, plc vs. Vazkepa. This

difference was mainly driven by diarrhoea (1.6% vs. 1.0%, plc vs. Vazkepa). Vice versa, nausea and

arthralgia/arthritis were a more frequent reason for discontinuation in the Vazkepa group compared to

plc. For further details, see table below.

Vazkepa was approved in the US in July 2012 and has been commercially available in the US since

January 2013. Vazkepa was most recently approved for marketing in Lebanon and United Arab

Emirates in March 2018 and July 2018, respectively. On 19 February 2016, FDA opened a Tracked

Safety Issue for Vazkepa regarding liver injury, under the classification of “standard.” As of 30 June

2016, FDA had determined that “no action is necessary at this time based on available information”.

Amarin continues to monitor all hepatic reports as events of special interest as part of the safety

surveillance.

Over the first 7 years of post-approval safety surveillance (26 July 2012 to 25 July 2019), there were a

total of 1204 unique reports of which 48 were serious reports. There has been one post marketing

safety report resulting from the marketing of Vazkepa outside US, in Lebanon during this period. This

report described elevation of triglycerides following initiation of therapy with Vazkepa.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions include arthralgia, product taste abnormal, blood

triglycerides increased, diarrhoea, nausea and eructation. No action has been taken for safety reasons

during this period.

**Reports on serious events**

During the period 26 July 2012 to 25 July 2019, there was a total of 48 expedited (15-day Alert)

reports (i.e., serious and unlabelled) reporting 69 events. There were four reports with a fatal outcome

during this period. Briefly, one report of death by suicide; one report of an accidental death by fire and

two reports of death of unknown cause while taking Vazkepa were received. There were three serious

adverse events assessed by the reporter as possibly related to Vazkepa and the events included

coronary artery occlusion, neonatal respiratory distress disorder and elevated liver enzymes. Of these

only the events of neonatal distress syndrome and elevated liver enzymes were also assessed by the

applicant as possibly related. There were an additional 13 serious adverse events evaluated by the

applicant to be possibly related to Vazkepa. These included two reports of choking/choking sensation,

two reports of epistaxis and one report each of atrial fibrillation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypersensitivity,

loss of consciousness, nausea, presyncope, prostate cancer, and syncope.

**Reports on non-serious events**

The most common SOC was Gastrointestinal Disorders and the most frequently reported events

included diarrhoea, nausea, eructation, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal discomfort,

dyspepsia, dysphagia, abdominal distention, retching, flatulence, and vomiting. Among the Cardiac

Disorders SOC, the most frequently reported terms were palpitations and atrial fibrillation.

**Further findings from Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports (PADERs)**

Upon a review of the provided PADERs, 19 cases reporting bleeding events were identified, out of

which 7 were reported in the last PADER (from 26-Jul-2018 to 25-Jul 2019). In 9 from the 19 cases

the respective bleeding event was assessed by the company to be possibly causally associated with

Vazkepa and to be non-serious. Furthermore, several reports of events related to hepatic disorders

were identified. A total 6 post-marketing cases of atrial fibrillation were identified by the Assessor. In

all 6 cases a reasonable time relationship between the use of Vazkepa and the occurrence of atrial

fibrillation is recognizable. Two of the 6 cases were reported as serious cases.
#### **2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety **

Safety assessment of Vazkepa is mainly based on the results of the large phase 3 trial REDUCE-IT.

In general, Vazkepa was well tolerated. The incidence of any adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs

was equally distributed between the treatment groups in REDUCE-IT. AEs leading to withdrawal of

study drug were rather infrequent (in around 8% of patients) and numerically slightly higher in the plc

group. In the pooled phase 2 trial ANCHOR and MARINE, AEs and SAEs were numerically less frequent

in the Vazkepa than in the plc group.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 111/129


-----

A numerical increase in the incidence of specific, frequent AEs in the Vazkepa compared to the plc

group was observed for the MedDRA terms musculoskeletal pain, constipation, peripheral oedema and

atrial fibrillation (AF). Regarding constipation, it should be noted that the plc substance, mineral oil, is

known to act as a laxative so that Vazkepa most likely does not increase constipation but plc decreases

it. Vice versa, anaemia was more frequently observed in the plc than in the Vazkepa group.

A more detailed analysis of AF events revealed that the increase in incidence with Vazkepa

predominantly occurred in patients with a history of AF. For these patients, a regular ECG monitoring

was recommended in the SmPC to allow early diagnosis which may increase the chance of successful

treatment of AF.

**Diarrhoea** was rather frequent in both treatment groups, affecting around 10% of patients. For the

plc (mineral oil) group this is expected but the question remains whether Vazkepa also can induce

diarrhoea. If so, the mechanism would be unclear. Mineral oil is thought to act as laxative because it is

not absorbed in the gut, but the latter should not be the case for EPA. On the other hand, it is not clear

whether Vazkepa or mineral oil (in the amount used as plc) caused diarrhoea at all; due to the rather

long duration of the REDUCE-IT study, it cannot be excluded that diarrhoea of other causes occurred at

least once in 10% of the participants. It is stated in the AE table in section 4.8 of the SmPC that

c **onstipation** as adverse reaction of Vazkepa was recorded with frequency common. It is also

mentioned (from post-marketing data) that Vazkepa is associated with diarrhoea. It is clarified in

section 4.8 that the relative incidence of constipation in this study may have been confounded by a

residual laxative effect for placebo, which comprised a subtherapeutic dose of light mineral oil (4 mL).

Among the less frequent AEs, there was a numerical increase in the Vazkepa compared to the plc

group in respect to **hyperuricemia and gout, cardiac conduction disorders** such as bundle branch

block, dermatitis, eczema and rash as well as for allergic conditions (mainly hypersensitivity). The

latter could be related to EPA’s effects on inflammation via metabolism via COX and LOX to

prostaglandin and leukotriene derivates. The reason for the cardiac effects (atrial fibrillation,

conduction disorders) is not known. A potential mechanism could be related to the fact that EPA can

inhibit several cardiac ion channels in micromolar concentrations (see non-clinical part); however, it is

not clear whether the circulating EPA concentrations are sufficient for relevant channel inhibition

because EPA is highly bound to plasma proteins.

Regarding hyperuricemia and gout, a recommendation for regular determination of serum urate level

during Vazkepa treatment is not considered necessary because AEs of gout were predominantly

reported in patients with pre-existing gout. Thus, Vazkepa may increase the number of gout attacks,

but in subjects with known gout the disease is regularly monitored anyway.

Increased incidence in the plc compared to the Vazkepa group of REDUCE-IT was observed for

**hyperglycaemia** (58.5% of study participants had diabetes mellitus), for **electrolyte disturbances**

(hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and for AEs of ventricular arrhythmias. Further evaluation of

hyperglycaemia events and glycaemic control in study participants with known diabetes did not reveal

any relevant effects of Vazkepa on HbA1c level, fasting blood glucose and hypoglycaemia rate.

**Bleeding events** were regarded as AEs of special interest since prior experience with ω3 fatty acids

containing oil. Bleeding-related AEs were slightly more frequent with Vazkepa than with plc in REDUCE
IT. This was also true for serious bleeding events and CNS bleeding (including subdural haematoma),

but the number of these events was low. Increased bleeding risk could be associated with lower risk of

thrombosis which in turn may contribute to the beneficial CV outcome as it is observed e.g. for ASA.

The difference in bleeding rate between Vazkepa and plc was rather small. This is also true for patients

taking antiplatelet drugs because this was the case for nearly 80% of participants in the REDUCE-IT

study. The applicant conducted further analyses. It turned out that the bleeding risk is particularly

Assessment report

-----

higher in patients concomitantly taking anti-coagulant or anti-platelet agents. A warning that patients

taking icosapent ethyl along with antithrombotic agents, i.e., antiplatelet agents, including

acetylsalicylic acid, and/or anticoagulants, may be at increased risk of bleeding and should be

monitored periodically was included in the SmPC. The phase 2 studies were too small for meaningful

conclusions on bleeding risk, but also in these studies bleeding events appeared to be more frequent in

the Vazkepa group despite higher use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medication in the plc group.

Some laboratory parameters ( **haematology, serum chemistry** ) were consistently altered by Vazkepa

or mineral oil. In line with increased anaemia in the plc group, it was observed that mean haemoglobin

levels increased vs. plc in the Vazkepa group in the first few years of treatment. Thereafter, the

difference between the Vazkepa and plc group in Hb level remained constant. Notably, erythrocyte

count did not change in accordance with the Hb change but remained virtually constant in both

treatment groups. This implies increased Hb content per erythrocyte (although this was not

determined in the study) with Vazkepa vs. plc. Increased Hb content per erythrocyte could be linked to

deficiency of vitamin B 12 or other nutrients so that either EPA or mineral oil could interfere with their

absorption in gut. Otherwise, an effect on bone marrow is conceivable. The applicant discussed this

possibility and considered it unlikely that mineral oil interferes with the intestinal absorption of

nutrients. A main argument was that patients with signs for anaemia due to malabsorption were not

over-represented in the mineral oil group.

There was a slight but steady increase in mean levels of **total bilirubin** in the Vazkepa-treated

patients and a more pronounced decrease vs. baseline in subjects treated with plc (mineral oil).

Accordingly, markedly more subjects in the Vazkepa than in the plc group had bilirubin levels above

upper normal limit. A similar phenomenon was observed for **creatine kinase** (CK). The underlying

biologic processes are unclear. The applicant could not provide a mechanistic explanation. These

findings may indicate that mineral oil has some biological effects, but since the changes were small,

they have no clinical relevance.

Vice versa, mean serum levels of **alkaline phosphatase** (AP) markedly increased over time during

the study in the plc group (and slightly decreased in the Vazkepa group). Accordingly, AP above upper

normal limit was more frequently observed in the plc group. The relevance of this finding is unclear,

particularly because AP can originate from various different tissues so that it is even unclear which

organ or tissue is affected by mineral oil treatment. The Applicant could not provide a mechanistic

explanation. The Applicant doubted that mineral oil can exert biological actions at all because it

becomes absorbed in very small amounts only; the described laboratory changes from baseline could

be due to the underlying disease. On the other hand, a biological effect of mineral oil cannot fully be

excluded since there are e.g. nutrient receptors on the surface of the intestinal mucosa which trigger

release of gut hormones. These receptors could be a target for mineral oil although there are no clear

hints for this in the published literature.

Mineral oil also caused changes in serum lipoproteins (increase of LDL-cholesterol and of apo-B) as

well of increase in CRP. The changes were small, but this does not exclude relevant biological sum

effect. It should be noted that the situation is similar for EPA. Its beneficial effects are thought to arise

from the sum of many small effects on different organ systems, including e.g. lipid metabolism,

inflammation, plaque stability and maybe coagulation. Thus, it is difficult to predict how large a

potentially unfavourable effect of mineral oil on CV endpoints could be. Since Vazkepa was tested

against mineral oil, it is unclear how large the remaining beneficial effect of EPA is when the

unfavourable effect of mineral oil is subtracted. The Applicant argued that mineral oil is known to be

safe and well-tolerated from its use as laxative. However, it is difficult to exclude any increased CV risk

based on standard safety data.

Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure and ECG) were not relevantly affected by Vazkepa or mineral oil.

Regarding **body weight**, it was remarkable that there was no mean weight gain in the study

participants during five years of treatment; to the contrary, weight loss of 1 kg and 2 kg in mean was

observed for Vazkepa and plc, respectively. In the study population, like in the general population,

body weight is expected to increase over the years. This may indicate that Vazkepa and mineral oil

decreases appetite; alternatively, this was because the study participants (nearly 60% subjects had

diabetes mellitus) strictly followed the lifestyle recommendations for diabetes such as diet and

exercise. The applicant confirmed that no special reinforcement of life-style measures took place in the

REDUCE-IT study. Rather, the participants followed the standard recommendations for subjects with

increased weight, plasma lipids and CV risk. The applicant also pointed out that the mean age of the

study participants was above 60 years and at this age, the annual body weight increase usually

becomes lower or ceases completely.

In order to assess safety in **renally impaired patients**, the applicant performed an AE analysis

stratified for subjects with eGFR at or above 60 mL/min vs. below 60 mL/min. As expected, patients

with eGFR<60 experienced more AEs, irrespective of study treatment (Vazkepa or plc). No increased

AE incidence vs. plc became obvious in the group of patients with moderate or severe renal

impairment.

In order to address safety in patients with **hepatic disorders**, the Applicant defined criteria to identify

patients with potential hepatic disorders at study entry. These criteria included patient history and

laboratory values. Classification according to the severity of hepatic impairment, e.g. by the Child-Pugh

score, was not performed. In the subgroup of patients with potential baseline hepatic disorder, the AE

profile was not relevantly different from the total study population. Thus, no safety signals became

obvious from this analysis.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have

been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.
#### **2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety **

No major safety issues were identified with Vazkepa. Interpretation of the safety results is hampered

by the fact that the direct and indirect biological effects of EPA probably affect many organ systems but

are hardly understood, particularly how they are linked to the desired CV benefit. Furthermore, the

substance used as placebo, mineral oil, had effects of its own. Therefore, it cannot always be decided

whether observed changes in AE frequency or laboratory values reflect an effect of EPA or an effect of

mineral oil. The application was considered acceptable from the clinical safety point of view. ***2.7. Risk Management Plan *** ***Safety concerns ***

#### ***2.8. Pharmacovigilance *** ***Pharmacovigilance system ***

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils

the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. ***Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements ***

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set

out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR

cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26.07.2012. The new EURD list entry will

therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. ***2.9. New Active Substance ***

The applicant declared that icosapent ethyl (EPA) should be considered as new active substance as it

has not been previously approved as active substance in a medicinal product in the Community and it

differs significantly in properties with regards to pharmacodynamic effects and biomarkers of

cardiovascular risk as compared to the EPA and mixtures of constituents included in the “omega-3
acid ethyl esters 90” previously authorised in the European Union (EU).

Medicinal products containing the active substance “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90” have been

authorised in the EU since the nineties (e.g. Omacor approved at daily doses from 2 g up to 4 g for the

treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia). The active substance of Omacor is “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90”

and consists of a mixture including ethyl esters of the omega-3 series polyunsaturated fatty acids

(ethyl esters of alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3), moroctic acid (C18:4 n-3), eicosatetraenoic acid

(C20:4 n-3), timnodonic (eicosapentaenoic) acid (C20:5 n-3; EPA), heneicosapentaenoic acid (C21:5

n-3), clupanodonic acid (C22:5 n-3) and cervonic (docosahexaenoic) acid (C22:6 n-3; DHA)).

As EPA is part of approved medicinal products containing EPA and mixtures of constituents included in

the “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90” that are licenced for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia it could

not be concluded that EPA was not previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the

European Union and that is from a chemical structure point of view not related to any other authorised

substances.

***Quality aspects***

The active ingredient of the finished product is ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA). The

assigned INN is icosapent ethyl. The active moiety of icosapent ethyl is eicosapentaenoic acid. The

manufacturing process of icosapent ethyl involves the ethyl esterification of fish oil and multiple

purification procedures (such as rectification/distillation and chromatography alone or combination of

rectification/ distillation with chromatography) to produce icosapent ethyl active substance that

contains not less than 96.0% icosapent ethyl.

***Clinical aspects***

The constituents of “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90” (including both EPA and DHA) have different

pharmacological effects compared to icosapent ethyl and the latter has some qualitative specificities as

developed in the above section.

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 117/129


-----

The content of EPA ethyl ester in Vazkepa is twice as high as in the “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90”

active substance (96% vs 43%). These characteristics of icosapent ethyl may impact on clinical effects

as compared with EPA contained in “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90”.

Although the relative contribution of ethyl-EPA and ethyl-DHA and the other constituents of the active

substance “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90” has not been evaluated to support the MA, it is documented

that the active moiety of icosapent ethyl, i.e., EPA, has different biological and pharmacodynamic

effects than the constituents of “3-omega-acid ethyl esters 90”, including both EPA and DHA. Most

notably, whereas both EPA and DHA have been reported to reduce triglycerides (TG), DHA alone with

EPA has been reported to be associated not only with reduction of TG levels, but also, importantly, with

significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with lipid disorder.

Most importantly, icosapent ethyl differs significantly in properties with regards to efficacy compared to

EPA and mixtures of constituents contained together in “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90”, as

demonstrated in single pivotal trial REDUCE-IT. In REDUCE-IT trial icosapent ethyl significantly

reduced the risk for the primary composite endpoint (time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death,

myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularisation, or hospitalisation for unstable angina;

p<0.0001) and the key secondary composite endpoint (time to first occurrence of cardiovascular

death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; p<0.0001). The beneficial effects of icosapent ethyl as

demonstrated in the pivotal trial in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and increased CV risk on

baseline statin therapy in the primary and secondary CV prevention represent a clinically meaningful

benefit for the patients that has not been demonstrated with EPA and mixtures of constituents

contained in “omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90” (see VITAL, ASCEND, STRENGTHT III, OMEMNI and JELIS

studies – in the benefit-risk section of this AR). Therefore, it is considered that icosapent ethyl differs

significantly in properties with regard to efficacy from substances previously authorised in the EU.

***Conclusion***

The CHMP considers, based on the available quality and clinical data, that the icosapent ethyl is

considered to be a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to efficacy

from EPA and mixtures of constituents contained in medicinal product(s) previously authorised within

the European Union (“omega-3-acid ethyl esters 90”).

## **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **
#### ***3.1. Therapeutic Context *** **3.1.1. Disease or condition **

*Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high*

*cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (* ≥ *150 mg/dL) and*

*•* *established cardiovascular disease, or*

*•* *diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor.*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on*

*cardiovascular events see section 5.1.*

In the EU, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 1.8 million deaths each year, which accounts for

37% of all deaths (European Heart Network Report, 2017). In 2015, there were 6.1 million new cases

of CVD in the EU and almost 49 million people were living with CVD in the EU. Half of these new CVD

cases were due to ischaemic heart disease, while around 10% of new CVD cases were due to stroke.

Hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for CVD. High TG levels

are often associated with low HDL-C and high levels of small dense LDL particles. The burden of HTG is

high, with about one-third of adult individuals having TG levels >1.7 mmol/l (150 mg/dL) (Bergheanu

SC et al. Neth Heart J 2017; Catapano AL et al., Eur Heart J. 2016).

Prevalence of severe HTG (500 to 2,000 mg/dl) is rare (Christian JB et al. Am J Cardiol 2011) but

elevated triglycerides at 150 mg/dL are a frequent observation. In Europe, the overall prevalence of

hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dL) has been reported at 29.6% (Qiao Q, Group DS Diabetologia

2006), while the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in individuals with coronary artery disease ranges

between 21.1 and 44.6 % (KotsevaK et al., Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil 2009.

Lp(a) is a specialised form of LDL and consists of an LDL-like particle and the specific apolipoprotein

(apo) A. Elevated Lp(a) is an additional independent risk marker and genetic data made it likely to be

causal in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic vascular disease and aortic stenosis (Kronenberg F et

al., J Int Med. 2013). **3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need **

In addition to available measures and therapies aiming at improvement of life style and other CV risk

factors, current treatments for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with elevated lipids

include drugs that lower lipid levels include statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, selective cholesterol absorption

inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe), fibrates, niacin (nicotinic acid) and bile acid sequestrants (anion exchange

resins). Considering that patients as included in the pivotal REDUCE-IT trial remain at high or very high

risk for MACE events and CV death despite of optimal baseline therapy, there is an unmet medical

need for additional therapeutic options.

#### **3.1.3. Main clinical studies **

The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial the REDUCE IT trial. It was a Phase 3 randomised,

placebo controlled, cardiovascular events driven study in patients with moderately elevated TG ( ≥ 1.5

and <5.6 mmol/L [ ≥ 135 and <500 mg/dL], after amendment 1: ≥ 2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and <500

mg/dL) on statin therapy and at high risk for CVD. Patients received 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily

(BID) (4 g/day) or matching placebo (mineral oil).

In addition to TG thresholds as an inclusion criterion, patients were included in two separate groups

based on CV risk at baseline (intended ratio 70/30% Group 1/Group 2):

   - CV Risk Category 1 (Secondary Prevention Cohort): men and women ≥ 45 years with

documented coronary artery diseases (CAD), cerebrovascular or carotid disease, or peripheral

arterial disease (PAD).

   - CV risk category 2 (Primary Prevention Cohort): Men and women ≥ 50 years of age with

diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) and additional predefined risk factors (smoker, higher

age, hypertension, renal dysfunction, retinopathy, micro- or macroalbuminuria, or Ankle

brachial index (ABI) <0.9 without symptoms).

Randomization was stratified by CV risk category, use of ezetimibe (yes/no), and by geographical

region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia Pacific). ***3.2. Favourable effects ***

Primary endpoint: 5 - fold MA CE (C V death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularisation,

unstable angina caused by myo c ard i al i s chemia and associated with emergent hospitalisation)

A primary endpoint event occurred in 17.2% (705/4089) of patients in the AMR101 group, as

compared with 22.0% (901/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.752 [95% CI: 0.682 to

0.830; p=0.00000001]; relative risk reduction [RRR] of 24.8% and number needed to treat [NNT] of

21). The median follow-up duration for the primary endpoint was 4.7 and 4.5 years for the AMR101

and placebo groups, respectively. The effect of AMR101 became observable after approximately 1.5

years of treatment. All 5 components of the primary composite endpoint contributed to the overall

statistically significant result. In a landmark analysis a significantly lower risk of major adverse CV

events with AMR101 than with placebo (HR of 0.799 [95% CI: 0.693 to 0.920; p=0.0017]) was

observed at the 2-year landmark.

Key secondary composite en dp o in t a na l ysi s (3 - fold MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke)

The key secondary endpoint is considered most important for the assessment of efficacy. The median

follow-up duration for the key secondary endpoint was 4.8 and 4.7 years for the AMR101 and placebo

groups, respectively. A key secondary endpoint event occurred in 11.2% (459/4089) of patients in the

AMR101 group, as compared with 14.8% (606/4090) of patients in the placebo group (HR of 0.735

[95% CI: 0.651 to 0.830; p=0.0000006]; RRR of 26.5% and NNT of 28). Similar to the primary

endpoint result, there was a lag time of about 1.5 years before differences between the groups became

apparent.

  - Nonfatal myocardial infarction: 237 (5.8%) vs. 332 (8.1%), HR 0.697 (0.590; 0.823, p <

  - Hospitalization for unstable angina: 108 (2.6%) vs. 157 (3.8%), HR 0.679 (0.531, 0.868, p =

0.002).

Other secondary endpoints

Statistically significant reductions in time to event (first event, ITT) were observed for the following

secondary endpoints (predefined hierarchical testing):

CV death or nonfatal MI; fatal of nonfatal MI; urgent or emergent revascularisation; CV death;

hospitalization for unstable angina; fatal or nonfatal stroke; total mortality, nonfatal MI or nonfatal

stroke (AMR101 vs. placebo, events (%), HR (95% CI), p value): 549 (13.4%) vs. 690 (16.9%), HR

0.772 (0.690, 0.864, p <.0001). For total mortality the numerical difference between the two groups

did not reach statistical significance: 274 (6.7%) vs. 310 (7.6%), HR 0.870 (0.739, 1.023. p = 0.0915.

Overall, the results for the primary endpoint were consistent for most of the predefined subgroups.

Geographical region, ezetimibe use, sex, hsCRP, eGFR, LDL-C, HDL-C, Apo-B, Non-HDL-C and TG at

baseline had no significant impact on efficacy as determined by the primary endpoint. A significant p

value for interaction was observed for age < 65 and ≥ 65 years with lower efficacy at the higher age

group. Although not significant (p value for interaction 0.1388), overall efficacy tended to be lower in

the primary prevention cohort:

  - Primary prevention: 146/1197 (12.2%) vs. 163/1197 (13.6%), HR 0.876 (0.700, 1.095)

  - Secondary Prevention: 559/2892 (19.3%) vs. 738/2893 (25.5%), HR 0.726 (0.650, 0.810)

Results for additional tertiary composite CV composites combining CV death and other CV events and

of several additional tertiary endpoints were consistent with the results for the primary and key

secondary analysis.
#### ***3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects ***

There are three main areas of uncertainty identified: (1) the choice of the comparator might have

biased the results in favour of Vazkepa, (2) the mechanism of action is to some degree unclear and (3)

there were uncertainties regarding the external validity of the study.

(1) Mineral oil as a comparator

Mineral oil (paraffin oil) was chosen as placebo, but it is not clear that mineral oil in fact is entirely

inert. Some of the markers relevant for prognosis showed a trend toward deterioration in the mineral

oil arm. Small numerical increases were observed for TG, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, apoB, and hsCRP.

Change from baseline in systolic BP showed a small difference between the groups. Whether these

observations just represented a natural course, were due to variability and regression to the mean

effects, or represented a negative effect of mineral oil is not clear. Based on published literature, an

increase in LDL-C by 7 – 9.3 mg/dl might translate into an increase in MACE events by about 4 – 5%,

an increase in Apo B by 6.0 mg/dL, into an increase in CAD by about 5%, and in major cardiovascular

disease risk by 4%, an increase in hsCRP by 0.5 mg into an increase by 4 – 5% in ischemic stroke and

coronary artery disease and an increase by 11% in vascular deaths. A difference in systolic blood

pressure by 0.6 – 1.5 mmHg may translate into a difference in CV event rates by about 2%. Taking

into consideration that such effects cannot be independently summed up, in a worst-case scenario

attributing all of these effects to mineral oil, a putative negative impact of mineral oil on MACE should

be below 10%. However, this is still an overestimation. Regression to the mean effects and the natural

course of the disease may considerably have contributed to the increase in LDL-C and apoB.

Furthermore, the scenario does not consider that the increase in HDL-C could be beneficial. Analyses

taking physicochemical properties of drugs, efficacy and bleeding patterns into account did not indicate

a major impact of mineral oil on absorption of statins, antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants. However,

e.g. the analyses of bleeding patterns were hampered by the fact that Vazkepa itself increases the risk

of bleeding. Based on analyses as provided by the applicant, a putative negative effect of mineral oil

should not account for more than 0.3 – 3% of MACE events. In summary, it is concluded that even

when assuming the unlikely worst-case scenario, the remaining beneficial effect of Vazkepa on MACE

events can be considered robust and meaningful.

(2) The mechanism of action was not clear

A dose dependent pronounced TG lowering effect has been demonstrated. However, TG lowering

therapy has not consistently been shown to result in a CV benefit with other medicinal products.

Numerous proposed mechanisms of action have been discussed in the public domain, including effects

on platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory actions, improvement in endothelial and vascular and

plaque stabilizing effects. Some of these effects were described to be pronounced in the presence of

statins. All patients in the study were on baseline statin therapy, however, subgroup analyses indicated

that efficacy of Vazkepa possibly is lower in patients on low dose statin therapy. This does not

necessarily indicate a positive interaction of Vazkepa with statins but rather may be related to the

overall lower CV risk in patients receiving only low dose statins. Some of acute mechanisms of action

as described in the literature do not necessarily fit with the observation in REDUCE-IT of a lag time of

about 1.5 years before efficacy is observed. The applicant has provided post hoc analyses from the

REDUCE IT trial indicating a correlation between efficacy on MACE and EPA levels. However, these data

are not conclusive due to sparse sampling and the post hoc nature of the analysis with a large impact

of imputation rules on the final results.

(3) External validity of the study

Recently EMA (EMEA/H/A-31/1464) has concluded that omega-3 acid ethyl esters – containing

medicinal products for oral use are not effective in the secondary prevention after myocardial

infarction. This conclusion was based on an analysis of all available data including the GISSI P study

(1999), the OMEGA trial, Rauch et al 2008 and meta-analyses. Relevant differences to the data

provided within this application are the lower dose used in these studies (1 g daily vs. 4 g Vazkepa)

and the composition.

It has been demonstrated within this application that effects on TGs and on some other lipid

parameters are dose dependent and considerably more pronounced at the 4 g daily dose as compared

to the 2 g daily dose.

Vazkepa contains EPA only, whereas the medicinal products analysed by EMA within EMEA/H/A
31/1464 contained a mixture of EPA and DHA. Different membrane locations and lipid interactions of

EPA and DHA may contribute to differences in biological activity (e.g. Sherratt SCR and Mason P

Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 2018; 212: 73 – 79).

Wei MY and Jacobson TA (2011 Curr Atheroscler Rep; 13: 474-83) described based on a meta
analytical analysis that both EPA and DHA reduce TG (DHA> than EPA). DHA raised LDL-C and HDL-C

whereas EPA non-significantly reduced LDL and had no effect on HDL. The authors speculated that the

Assessment report

-----

greater decrease in triglycerides (and increase in LDL) observed with DHA may result from greater

lipoprotein lipase activation by DHA compared with EPA. Based on such considerations it may well be

that the clinically relevant effects are different between EPA and DHA.

In addition, two other recent studies failed to show a beneficial effect on CV outcome.

In the VITAL study (N Engl J Med 2019; 380:23-32) no beneficial effect of marine n−3 fatty acids (at a

dose of 1 g per day) could be demonstrated in a primary prevention setting (HR for the primary

composite MACE endpoint: 0.92 (0.80 – 1.06). Numerically the number of MIs were reduced (145 vs.

200 events, HR 0.72 (0.59 – 0.90)) but no beneficial effect on total stroke or death from CV causes

could be demonstrated. Similarly, the ASCEND trial (Wallendszus K et al, N Engl J Med

2018;379:1540-1550.) which tested n−3 supplementation (at a dose of 1 g per day) in adults with

diabetes in the United Kingdom, also showed generally null results.

All of these trials investigated lower doses and a different composition of the medicinal product.

Recently the STRENGTH study, a CV outcome trial investigating 4g/day Omega 3-carboxylic acid

(containing EPA and DHA) on CV outcome in statin-treated patients with high cardiovascular risk,

hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been

terminated (JAMA. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.22258 Published online November 15, 2020) based on an

interim analysis that indicated a low probability of clinical benefit. With 13078 patients randomized the

primary end point occurred in 785 patients (12.0%) treated with omega-3 CA vs 795 (12.2%) treated

with corn oil (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95%CI, 0.90-1.09]; P = .84). In this trial corn oil was used as a

comparator.

In addition, the recently published OMEMI study (10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.052209) did not

show a benefit of 1.8 g n-3 PUFA (930 mg EPA and 660 mg DHA) versus placebo (corn oil) daily to

standard of care in 70-82 years old patients with recent (2-8 weeks) acute myocardial infarction.

It is noted that none of the negative trials used mineral oil as a comparator.

Some external support comes from the JELIS trial (Lancet. 2007 Mar 31;369:1090-8) a study that in a

PROBE design investigated efficacy and safety of 1800 g EPA daily on top of statins vs. statins alone in

hypercholesteraemic patients in Japan on a broadly defined composite CV endpoint. The primary

endpoint showed a statistically significant result although questions arise concerning the definition of

the endpoint components and the numerical increase in all-cause mortality, haemorrhagic strokes and

a lack of efficacy for ischemic strokes.

Taken together, there are conflicting results reporting in this area and external support is limited. The

positive results of the REDUCE-IT study have some external but not quite robust support from the

JELIS trial. Most studies in the field used different comparators and failed to show a CV benefit.

However, these studies used lower doses of mixtures of EPA/DHA as opposed to high dose of EPA

alone used in REDUCE-IT with mineral oil as placebo.
#### ***3.4. Unfavourable effects ***

No major safety concern of Vazkepa was identified. The percentage of patients suffering at least one

treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was nearly identical between the treatment groups,

Vazkepa and plc. The same was true for serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation.

Regarding specific AEs by organ class, a numerically higher frequency in the Vazkepa group was

observed for the following terms:

  - oedema peripheral

Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021 Page 123/129


-----

  - atrial fibrillation

  - musculoskeletal pain

  - hyperuricaemia/Gout

  - cardiac conduction disorders

  - dermatitis/Eczema/Rash

  - allergic conditions

  - fatigue, asthenia

  - dysgeusia

  - bleeding

The latter was evaluated as AE of special interest since previous studies with ω3-fatty acid containing

marine oil gave hints for increased bleeding risk.

Vice versa, the AE of anaemia was more frequent in the plc than in the Vazkepa group.

For all the mentioned terms, the numerical imbalance in frequency between the Vazkepa and the plc

group was small so that they could at least in part be chance findings. The pharmacodynamic effects of

EPA are complex so that it is difficult to predict on a mechanistic basis which AEs could be biologically

plausible.

However, further analysis by the applicant revealed that bleeding risk was particularly increased in

subjects concomitantly taking anti-coagulant or anti-platelet medication. AEs of gout were

predominantly increased in patients taking Vazkepa and having a history of gout. Accordingly, atrial

fibrillation was also more frequent with Vazkepa compared to plc predominantly in the subpopulation of

subjects with history of AE. These findings indicate that bleeding, gout and atrial fibrillation are true

side effects of Vazkepa. This information was included in the agreed SmPC along with the most

susceptible subpopulations as mentioned above.

In addition, diarrhoea was frequently reported in the Vazkepa group (9% of patients). This condition

was slightly more frequent in the plc group (11%), but this can be expected since the plc substance

was mineral oil which can be used as laxative. Probably for this reason, constipation was more

frequently reported in the Vazkepa than in the plc group.

There were also findings in serum chemistry and haematology parameters.

Mean haemoglobin (Hb) levels were virtually identical at baseline in the plc and Vazkepa group but

increase in the latter and remained higher than plc throughout the study. Erythrocyte count remained

constant so that obviously the Hb content per erythrocyte increased, although this was not measured

in the study.

There were consistent changes in some serum chemistry parameters, identified by mean increase or

decrease from baseline and a higher incidence of values above upper or below lower limit of normal.

  - Total bilirubin slightly increased over time with Vazkepa and more pronounced decreased with

plc (mineral oil)

  - Alkaline phosphatase slightly decreased with Vazkepa and markedly increased with mineral oil

  - Creatine kinase slightly increase with Vazkepa and markedly decreased with mineral oil

EMA/145271/2021 Page 124/129


-----

The underlying mechanism of these findings are unclear, but the magnitude of these changes was

small so that they are unlikely to be of clinical relevance.
#### ***3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects ***

In respect to AE incidence, there were some numerical imbalances between the Vazkepa and the plc

group. It cannot be decided whether the difference was due to an effect of Vazkepa or an effect of the

plc substance mineral oil. Evaluation of laboratory findings revealed that there were consistent changes

from baseline also in the case of mineral oil treatment so that the latter appears to have effects of its

own; the underlying mechanism is unclear.

The observed effects of Vazkepa and mineral oil were small, and each individual effect cannot be

regarded as adverse. However, the desired effect of Vazkepa on CV outcome has also to be regarded

as a sum of (in part unknown) small effects, each of which alone would be regarded minor or virtually

negligible. Vice versa this means that it is difficult to predict to which extent these small effects add up

to relevant adverse effects.

Increased bleeding risk could be associated with lower risk of thrombosis which in turn may contribute

to the beneficial CV outcome.

The reason for the cardiac effects (atrial fibrillation, conduction disorders) is not known. A potential

mechanism could be related to the fact that EPA can inhibit several cardiac ion channels in micromolar

concentrations. However, it is not clear whether the circulating EPA concentrations are sufficient for

relevant channel inhibition because EPA is highly bound to plasma proteins. ***3.6. Effects Table ***

#### ***3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion *** **3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects **

The benefit as demonstrated for primary 5-fold MACE endpoint (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke,

coronary revascularisation, unstable angina caused by myocardial ischemia and associated with

emergent hospitalisation) and the key secondary 3-fold MACE endpoint (CV death, nonfatal MI,

nonfatal stroke), which is considered even more important, is clinically relevant. The result was

consistent over a wide variety of predefined subgroups, was seen in patients in two risk categories

(primary and secondary prevention) and was supported by secondary endpoints (all MIs, all strokes,

CV mortality, unstable angina, composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal MIs, nonfatal strokes).

Numerically, the effect on CV mortality was preserved for all-cause mortality. A benefit was also seen

when recurrent events were evaluated, although the respective analysis was difficult to interpret.

Irrespective of the uncertainties as discussed above, these results indicate a meaningful clinical benefit

to the patients.

The wording of the proposed indication sufficiently represents the patient population with a

demonstrated positive benefit/risk balance.

Overall, the safety profile can be considered rather benign. There appears to be a slightly increased

risk of bleeding, particularly in subjects concomitantly taking anticoagulant or anti-platelet medication;

this is considered important because it can seriously affect the use of Vazkepa (e.g. in case of

intracranial bleeding). However, it should be noted that Vazkepa numerically decreased total mortality

so that the overall effect of Vazkepa on mortality remains positive.

Vazkepa appears to increase the incidence of gout and atrial fibrillation, particularly in subjects with a

history of the respective condition. It is assumed that these unfavourable effects are manageable with

appropriate therapy and would not preclude use of Vazkepa for preventing CV events.

There were some minor changes in laboratory values in patients taking Vazkepa compared to the

placebo group which most likely are not clinically relevant. **3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks **

The benefits of Vazkepa have been established in terms of important clinical outcomes although the

evidence was established in a single pivotal study. The effect size is moderate but clinically meaningful.

After amending the wording of the indication and specifying age as a CV risk factor in the study

description, the proposed target population appropriately reflects the study population with respect to

baseline cardiovascular (CV) risk (patients at “high cardiovascular risk”) and triglyceride (TG) levels

(≥150 mg/dL), for which a positive benefit-risk balance has been demonstrated. The applicant stated

that reference to “statin-treated patients” in the wording of indication would better reflect the inclusion

criteria in pivotal study than reference to “maximally tolerated” statin therapy which was initially

requested in line with the recommendations of clinical guidelines. This was considered acceptable.

The safety profile of Vazkepa was considered relatively benign. The risks are potentially important in

adherence to treatment in real life conditions (e.g. GI effects) and for the safe use of the product (e.g.

atrial fibrillation and bleeding) but seem relatively infrequent and potentially manageable.
#### ***3.8. Conclusions ***

The overall B/R of Vazkepa is positive.
## **4. Recommendations **
#### ***Outcome ***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the benefit-risk balance of Vazkepa is favourable in the following indication:

*Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high*

*cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) and*

  - *established cardiovascular disease, or*

  - *diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor.*

*For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on*

*cardiovascular events see section 5.1.*

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

conditions: ***Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use ***
