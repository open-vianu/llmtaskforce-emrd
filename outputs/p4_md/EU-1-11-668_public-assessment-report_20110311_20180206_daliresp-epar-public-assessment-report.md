### **2. Scientific discussion **
#### ***2.1. Introduction ***

Roflumilast is a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. PDE4 is an important regulator of

cyclic AMP in most cell types involved in inflammatory processes. Inhibition of PDE4 reduces the

breakdown of cAMP, which in turn down-regulates the inflammatory process.

This Marketing Authorisation Application has been submitted as an informed consent application to the

marketing authorisation for Daxas in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Therefore, consent from the marketing authorisation holder of the Daxas application, which had been

submitted as a full application under Art 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended, has been given

allowing access to Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier of this authorised product and any

subsequent postmarketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Daliresp

consists only of Module 1 information

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Daliresp medicinal product are identical to the up
to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Daxas. Information on the scientific discussions can be

found in the Daxas CHMP assessment report and in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).

Daliresp 500 micro-grams film-coated tablets is indicated for the maintenance treatment of severe

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted)

associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a history of frequent exacerbations as add on

to bron-chodilator treatment.

The medicinal product is a film-coated tablet containing 500 microgram roflumilast. The recommended

dose is one 500 microgram tablet once daily. ***2.2. Quality aspects ***

Since the application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the quality data in

support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Daxas dossier

which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the non-clinical

data in support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Daxas

dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). **2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

An environmental risk assessment has been provided in 1.6.1 Non-GMO. The Applicant refers to the

Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (June 2006,

EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) to demonstrate that on the basis of the data provided it is not considered

that roflumilast has a risk to the environment.

EMA/43726/2011 5/12


-----

Roflumilast is highly metabolized, with no parent compound detected in urine. Low dosages result in a

PEC (0.0025 μg/L) below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, and acute short-term studies from each of the 3

trophic levels (fish, Daphnia, algae) show, that the algae is the most sensitive species. The derived

PNEC is 0.024 μg/L and the PEC/PNEC ratio is below 1 (0.104). Furthermore, the log P (o/w) was also

found to be below the action limit. A comparison of calculated plasma levels in fish with those

measured at NOAELs in rats showed sufficient safety margins towards adverse reproductive effects.

Thus, it is concluded that the use of roflumilast is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment

following its prescribed usage in patients, and no further actions have to be taken.
#### ***2.4. Clinical aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the clinical data in

support of the Daliresp application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Daxas dossier,

which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). ***2.5. Pharmacovigilance *** **Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system **

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the

legislative requirements. **Risk Management Plan **

The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan.

Long-term comparative observational post-marketing study|Section 4.4 of the SmPC: In 1-year studies (M2-124, M2-125), a decrease of body weight occurred more frequently in patients treated with Daliresp compared to placebo-treated patients. After discontinuation of Daliresp, the majority of patients had regained body weight after 3 months. Body weight of underweight patients should be checked at each visit. Patients should be advised to check their body weight on a regular basis. In the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning weight decrease, the intake of Daliresp should be stopped and body weight should be further followed-up. SmPC Section 4.8: Weight decreased is included as common adverse reaction.|

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the MA application is of the opinion that the

following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal

product:

The Member States must ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective

use of the medicinal product described below are implemented in their national territory:

  - Prior to launch of the product in the Member State, the national competent authority shall

agree the content and format of the educational material with the Marketing Authorisation

Holder

  - The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) should ensure that, at launch, all Healthcare

Professionals who are expected to prescribe Daliresp are provided with an Educational pack.

The educational pack should contain the following:

  - Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet for Daliresp

  - Educational material for the physician.

EMA/43726/2011 10/12


-----

  - Copies of the patient card to be given to patients before they receive Daliresp

The educational material for the prescriber should include information on the following key elements:

  - The specific indication approved. The fact that Daliresp is not indicated for the treatment of

COPD patients other than those covered by the approved indication, nor for use in patients

with asthma or alpha 1 anti trypsine deficiency.

  - The need to inform patients about the risks of Daliresp and the precautions for safe use.

  - The risk of weight decrease in underweight patients and the need to monitor the body weight

at each visit and to stop the treatment in the event of an unexplained and clinically concerning

weight decrease. Patients should be advised to weigh themselves at regular intervals and

record the weight in the patient card.

  - The risk of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, anxiety, depression in patients receiving

Daliresp and the potential risk of suicide. Hence, the need to carefully assess the benefit risk

balance of this treatment in patients with existing psychiatric symptoms or with history of

depression and to inform patients to report any changes in behaviour, mood and any suicidal

ideation. Daliresp is not recommended in patients with a history of depression associated with

suicidal ideation or behaviour.

  - The potential risk of malignant tumours and the lack of experience in patients with past history

of cancer. Daliresp should not be initiated or should be stopped in patients with cancers

(except basal cell carcinoma).

  - That increased exposure might occur in certain populations and increase the risk of persistent

intolerability:

`o` Special populations who have increased PDE4 inhibition such as black non smoking

females

`o` Patients concomitantly treated with CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as fluvoxamine) or dual

CYP3A4/1A2 inhibitors (such as enoxacin and cimetidine)

  - The potential risk of infections: Daliresp should not be initiated, or treatment should be

stopped, in patients with severe acute infectious diseases. The limited experience in patients

with latent infections such as tuberculosis, viral hepatitis or herpes infections.

  - The lack of experience in patients with HIV infection or active hepatitis, with severe

immunological diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematous, multifocal

leukoencephalopathy) or treated with immunosuppressive therapy (other than short-term

systemic corticosteroids) and that Daliresp should not be initiated or should be stopped in

these patients.

  - The potential cardiac risk: Daliresp has not been studied in patients in congestive heart failure

(NYHA grade 3 and 4); hence, it is not recommended in this population.

  - The limited or missing information in patients with liver impairment. Daliresp is contraindicated

in patients with moderate or severe liver impairment (Child Pugh B or C). Clinical data are

considered insufficient to recommend dose adjustment and caution should be observed in

patients with mild liver impairment (child Pugh A).

  - The lack of clinical data to support the combination with theophylline and that such

combination is not recommended.

EMA/43726/2011 11/12


-----

**Patient Card**

The patient card should contain the following key elements:

That they should tell their doctor if they have a history of any of the following conditions

       - cancer

       - insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour

       - multiple sclerosis or SLE

       - infection with tuberculosis, herpes, hepatitis, HIV

That patients should tell their doctor if they develop symptoms indicative of:

  - insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation or behaviour

  - severe infection

That patients should tell their doctor if they are taking any other medicines.

That Daliresp may cause weight loss and patients should weigh themselves regularly and record their

weight on the patient card.

The patient card should include an area where patients can record their weight and the date they

weighed themselves and they should be asked to bring the patient card with them at each visit
#### ***2.6. Recommendation ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Daxas marketing authorisation, the CHMP

considered that the risk-benefit balance of Daliresp was favourable and therefore recommended the

granting of the marketing authorisation for the following indication:

Daliresp is indicated for the maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

(COPD) (FEV1 post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult

patients with a history of frequent exacerbations as add on to bronchodilator treatment.
