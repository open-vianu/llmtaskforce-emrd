### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1 Introduction ***

This marketing authorisation application for Onduarp (telmisartan / amlodipine) has been submitted by

Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH as an informed consent application in accordance with

Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended.

The MAH (Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH) for Twynsta, which was authorised on 07 October

2010, provided consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of

the initial dossier of this authorised product and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted,

assessed and approved.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Onduarp medicinal product are identical to the

up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Twynsta. The application for Onduarp concerns

the identical strengths to those approved for Twynsta and consists of only Module 1. Information on

the scientific discussion can be found in the Twynsta CHMP assessment reports and in the European

Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

The approved indication is:

“Treatment of essential hypertension in adults:

*Add on therapy*

ONDUARP is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine.

*Replacement therapy*

Adult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of

ONDUARP containing the same component doses” ***2.2 Quality aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Twynsta application, the quality data in support of

the Onduarp application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Twynsta dossier, which have

been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). ***2.3 Non-clinical aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Twynsta application, the non-clinical data in

support of the Onduarp application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Twynsta

dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

Currently ongoing experimental studies are aimed to investigate the potential additive or synergistic

effects due to compound specific properties that have been described for telmisartan and amlodipine in

the pre-clinical/clinical literature on top of their blood pressure lowering effect.

Results of these ongoing studies on the beneficial effects of Telmisartan/Amlodipine treatment beyond

blood pressure lowering should be provided.

An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been provided, which is identical to the version

submitted for the Twynsta initial Marketing Authorisation. The medicinal product subject to this

application is intended to be administered at comparable dose levels and for indications that are

already approved in the European Community for Twynsta. Based on the assumption that the product

Onduarp
Assessment report EMA/891763/2011

-----

is intended to substitute for identical products on the market, the approval of the referred product

should not result in an increase of the total quantity of the active ingredients released in to the

environment. Therefore, it should not result in an increase of risk to the environment during storage,

distribution, use and disposal.

For the active ingredient telmisartan, all required studies for the Phase II assessment of telmisartan

were provided. Based on the study results no environmental risk for the aquatic compartment and the

sediment could be expected. Additionally a potential of telmisartan to bioaccumulate could be

excluded. Concerning the active ingredient telmisartan no further risk assessment was required and no

special precautions had to be considered (the general disposal advice is included in the Package

Leaflet). However, because of new scientific findings, new comments concerning the water-sediment

study were raised by the CHMP. The study report on the OECD 308 study on transformation of

telmisartan in water/sediment systems indicates that the following [14] C- labelled test item (labelled

atom indicated by an asterisk) was used:

In the part of the study report on transformation product the following statement is made: “The

amount of parent substance in the total river and pond systems slowly declined with time from an

initial level of about 97-98% of the applied radioactivity to 90% and 82% after 103 days of incubation

in the river and pond total systems, respectively. Besides the parent compound, three very minor

degradation products were detected, none individually exceeding 2% of applied in either total

systems.” The conclusion of the study report is that there are no relevant transformation products

produced. Recently, information has been published on transformation products of a parent active

ingredient from the substance class of the “sartans” to which telmisartan also belongs to. Kern et al.

(2010) and Helbling et al. (2010) described the formation of a transformation product from valsartan

(valsartan acid, 2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid) that is considerably more stable than

the parent compound (DT 50 valsartan acid = 410 x DT 50 parent). Additionally this persistent

transformation product has been detected in the effluent from a sewage treatment plant in the low

µg/L range. The molecule under study in Kern et al. (2010) and Helbling et al. (2010) is not

telmisartan, but another member of the sartan family. Despite differences in the two molecules, the

moiety forming the persistent transformation product is also present in telmisartan (substituted

biphenyl moiety, orange circle in the figure below). In telmisartan the substituent is a carboxyl group,

whereas in valsartan a tetrazole group is found in the same position. As carboxyl and tetrazole groups

are considered to be bioisosteric, this difference is not considered to be substantial. Therefore the

formation of a similar transformation product from telmisartan that has been observed from valsartan

is considered possible.

The presented OECD 308 study however cannot answer the question whether such a transformation

product is formed because the labelled C-atom is not located in the biphenyl moiety in question (see

figure below) and consequently the potential transformation product cannot be detected when only

screening for radiolabelled transformation products.

-----

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the

CHMP therefore recommends the following points for further investigation:

The applicant should examine the possibility of formation of a comparable transformation product as

described for valsartan in the case of telmisartan. This issue could be addressed by conducting a study

with a radiolabel in a suitable position, or by conducting an unlabelled study and employing analytical

methods capable of detecting, identifying and quantifying the potential transformation product, or

finally by providing a scientific argumentation that the data as already presented in the water-sediment

study for Twynsta are conclusive enough for excluding the formation of a comparable transformation

product for telmisartan as described for valsartan.

For the active ingredient amlodipine, a detailed environmental risk assessment was provided. Based on

the studies results no environmental risk for the aquatic environment can be expected. However, a

study on sediment dwelling organisms is missing and should be provided.

Therefore, in the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific

progress, the CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation::

  - The applicant is requested to submit a test on toxicity to sediment dwelling organisms

according to OECD.

  - The applicant is requested to identify the metabolite Met1 since according to OECD 308

metabolites with an amount > 10 % should be identified.

  - The applicant is requested to provide an experimental determined n-octanol/water partition

coefficient for amlodipine since the estimated and calculated log K ow value exceeds a value of

2.
##### ***2.4 Clinical aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Twynsta application, the clinical data in support of

the Onduarp application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Twynsta dossier, which have

been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). ***2.5 Pharmacovigilance *** **Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system **

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the

legislative requirements.

##### **Risk Management Plan **

The CHMP considered the safety profile of fixed dose combination of telmisartan and amlodipine well

established and no safety concerns requiring risk minimisation activities have been identified. A Risk

Management Plan (RMP) is therefore not considered necessary. Since for the reference product

Twynsta no RMP has been established, the CHMP was of the opinion that none is required for Onduarp.

In line with the reference product Twynsta, the applicant should however closely monitor and discuss

in future PSURs all cardiovascular events leading to fatal outcome.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance

was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. **PSUR **

The MAH should follow the PSUR submission cycle as agreed for Twynsta, which is on a 6-monthly

cycle, having 07 October —2011 as its data lock point.
###### The applicant should closely monitor and discuss in the PSURs all cardiovascular events leading to fatal outcome.
##### ***2.6 User consultation ***

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the Package

Leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The Package Leaflet of Twynsta has been successfully user tested in the framework of its evaluation for

which the CHMP opinion was adopted on 22 April 2010. Since the proposed Package Leaflet for the

current application is identical to the Package Leaflet for Twynsta except for the product-specific

information, no further testing is warranted.
### **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **

This Marketing Authorisation application for Onduarp (telmisartan/amlodipine) has been submitted by

Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH as an informed consent application in accordance with

Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Onduarp medicinal product are identical to the

up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Twynsta. The application for Onduarp concerns

the identical strengths to those approved for Twynsta and consists of only Module 1. Information on

the scientific discussion can be found on the Twynsta CHMP assessment reports and in the European

Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Twynsta

initial marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP

considers that the benefit/risk balance for Onduarp is postive.

### **4. Recommendations **
##### **Outcome **

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the risk-benefit balance of Onduarp in the

treatment of essential hypertension in adults:

*Add on therapy*

ONDUARP is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on amlodipine.

*Replacement therapy*

Adult patients receiving telmisartan and amlodipine from separate tablets can instead receive tablets of

ONDUARP containing the same component doses

is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the

following conditions: ***Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use ***

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. ***Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation ***

***Risk management system and PSUR cycle***

The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the

marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market.

The PSUR cycle for the product will follow the cycle of the original medicinal product Twynsta. ***Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the *** ***medicinal product ***

Not applicable ***Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the *** ***medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States. ***

Not applicable.
