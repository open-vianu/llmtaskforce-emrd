### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1 Introduction ***

Hyperphosphataemia is one the most common sequalae of chronic kidney disease. According to the

epidemiologic data, hyperphosphataemia is associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular

disease events both in general population and especially in chronic kidney disease patients. Preclinical

and clinical data support the hypothesis that this association is mediated by cardiovascular calcification

and by other detrimental effects of hyperphosphatemia on vasculature and heart. Based on these

findings, the main renal guidelines recommend strongly the restriction of dietary phosphorus and/or the

use oral phosphate binders to achieve the recommended serum phosphorus level in dialysis patients and,

with some reservations, also in pre-dialysis patients. Currently available authorised therapeutic agents

for hyperphosphatemia in Europe include calcium-containing phosphate binders (calcium carbonate;

calcium acetate; combination of calcium acetate and magnesium carbonate), lanthanum carbonate and

ion-change resins including sevelamer hydrochloride, sevelamer carbonate and colestilan.

This Marketing Authorisation Application concerns Tasermity 800 mg tablets, in the treatment of

hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. It is a duplicate

application to the marketing authorisation (MA) of Renagel (EMEA/H/C/000254)

The active substance is sevelamer hydrochloride (ATC code: V03AE02; Pharmacotherapeutic Group:

Treatment of hyperphosphataemia).

The application has been submitted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and is regarded to

have automatic access for substance already authorised via Centralised Procedure. Eligibility based on

automatic access was confirmed by EMA on 20 February 2014. The CHMP appointed during February 2014

meeting Dr Janne Komi as Rapporteur and Dr. Bart Van der Schueren as Co-Rapporteur.

The legal basis of this application is Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/ EC, Informed consent application,

and accordingly a complete Module 1 is submitted. Letter of consent from the MAH of Renagel has been

enclosed. The Applicant Sanofi-aventis recherché et developpement and Genzyme Europe B.V. (a Sanofi

company) is the marketing authorisation holder of the reference medicinal product Renagel. ***2.2 Quality aspects ***

As Tasermity is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC,

only module 1 is provided and module 3 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 3

of the original dossier (Renagel), which have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing

procedures. ***2.3 Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1 Introduction **

Since this application is an informed consent of the Renagel application, the non-clinical data in support

of the Tasermity application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Renagel dossier, which

have been assessed and approved, including all post-marketing procedures.

##### **2.3.2 Environmental risk assessment **

In accordance with the scope described in the CHMP guideline, given that this application is for products

that are already authorized, the absence of a phased approach ERA as specified in the guideline, is

considered justified in that the total quantity of the drug substance sevelamer hydrochloride is not

expected to increase upon approval of this marketing authorization. Consequently, marketing approval

would not add to the environmental impact. **2.2.3 Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

In this informed consent application, there are no issues related to the non-clinical data, which have been

assessed for Renagel application and adequately reflected in the Product Information. ***2.4 Clinical aspects ***

As Tasermity is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC,

only module 1 is provided and module 2 of the duplicate dossier cross-refers to the up-to-date module 2

of the original dossier (Renagel), which has been assessed and approved. No new clinical data is provided. ***2.5 Clinical safety ***

The RMP version 5 being strictly identical to the RMP approved for the reference product, therefore no

further assessment of the present RMP is deemed necessary. ***2.6 Pharmacovigilance ***

**Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system**

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the

legislative requirements. ***2.7 Risk Management Plan ***

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

The CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 5 is acceptable.
### **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **

This Marketing Authorisation application for Tasermity has been submitted by Genzyme Europe BV as an

informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended.

As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Tasermity medicinal product are identical to the

up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Renagel. The application for Tasermity concerns the

identical strengths to those approved for Renagel and consists of only Module 1. Information on the

scientific discussion can be found on the Renagel CHMP assessment reports and in the European Public

Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website.

EMA/CHMP/68384/2015 Page 9/10


-----

Consequentially, and in line with the assessment of data undertaken in the framework of the Renagel

initial marketing authorisation application as well as within all post-autorisation procedures, the CHMP

considers that the benefit/risk balance for Tasermity is positive.
### **4. Recommendations **

***Outcome***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that

the risk-benefit balance of Tasermity in the treatment for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult

patients receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is favourable. Sevelamer hydrochloride should be

used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplements,

1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D 3 or one of its analogues to control the development of renal bone disease.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

conditions:

***Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use***

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

***Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation***

- **Periodic Safety Update Reports**

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in

accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for

under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal.

***Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product***

- **Risk management system (RMP)**

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the

agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent

updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:

   - At the request of the European Medicines Agency;

   - Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information

being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of

an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

   - When the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they should be submitted at

the same time.
