## **2 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION **
### **2.1 Introduction **

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a subtype of mature peripheral B-cell neoplasms,
characterized by the accumulation of circulating malignant lymphocytes that typically express cell
surface markers CD5, CD20, and CD23. It is the most common type of leukaemia in adults in Western
Europe and in the US. The median age at diagnosis is 65-70 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1.
Initially, most patients present with asymptomatic lymphocytosis and do not need cytoreductive
therapy [Kay, 2002]. Patients with active disease are characterized by a lymphocyte doubling time of
less than 6 months, or progressive, even massive lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia and
thrombocytopenia. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, unintended weight loss, and
extreme fatigue are common in advanced disease and can significantly impact quality of life. CLL also
causes relative immunosuppression that increases the risk of infections that are ultimately the major
cause of death in this patient population. Median survival at diagnosis ranges from 5 to 20+ years
depending on risk factors, but is only 6 to 14 months for patients with CLL refractory to available
therapies [Tam, 2007].
The purine analog fludarabine, alone or in combination with other agents, can be considered as the
backbone of CLL therapy in both the frontline and subsequent lines of therapy [Rai 2000; Catovsky,
2007]. However, chlorambucil may still be a suitable first-line treatment for elderly patients with CLL

[Rai 2000]. Alemtuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen
which is expressed on the cell surface of both B cells and T cells, has been approved for the treatment
of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate. Recently,
rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was approved for first-line treatment of patients with
CLL in combination with chemotherapy (January 2009). Although most patients with CLL will
achieve responses with initial therapy, nearly all patients relapse and require further treatments.
Advanced age, more than 2 prior therapies [Wierda, 2005], and the presence of chromosomal
abnormalities such as 17p and 11q deletions [Dohner, 2000] are associated with decreased response to
therapy.

-----

Therapy for second and subsequent lines depends on the response and the duration of response to prior
therapy. If the duration of response is at least 12 to 18 months, the same regimen can be tried again. If
the duration of response is short or lacking, a different therapeutic approach is needed.
For double-refractory patients (DR) who no longer respond to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, no
established therapies are available. Patients with bulky (lymphadenopathy >5 cm) fludarabinerefractory CLL (BFR) also have a high unmet medical need because available treatment options
appear to be less effective [Fiegl, 2006] and associated with increased toxicity [Perkins, 2002].

Ofatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds specifically to a distinct epitope
encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule
is a transmembrane phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from the pre-B to mature B
lymphocyte stage and on B cell tumours.

Ofatumumab induces cross linking of CD20 molecules and relocation of these CD20 molecules to socalled lipid rafts considered important for induction of cell signalling and effective complement
activation. The binding of ofatumumab induces cell death of CD20 positive cells, primarily through
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC), and less by apoptosis. The resulting depletion of malignant B cells carrying the CD20
epitope by ofatumumab treatment is considered the main mechanism of action leading to clinical
benefit to subjects with CD20-expressing cell tumours.

Glaxo Group Ltd applied for a marketing authorisation via the centralised procedure for ofatumumab
with the invented name Arzerra. The application was made in accordance with Article 8(3) of
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. The proposed indication was: ‘treatment of patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who have failed therapy with a fludarabine containing regimen and
have failed therapy with, or are inappropriate for, an alemtuzumab containing regimen’. The finally
approved indication is: ‘treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients refractory to
fludarabine and alemtuzumab’.
Ofatumumab is designated as an orphan medicinal product in the EU for the indication: “treatment of
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia” (EU/3/08/581). The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products
(COMP) concluded that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was estimated to be affecting approximately
3.5 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application was made (June 2008) and that the
condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening, in particular due to poor long-term survival in
high-risk patients.
No paediatric investigation plan was submitted with the application, as ofatumumab is covered by a
class waiver on the ‘treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia’, a condition which is not applicable
to children.
### **2.2 Quality aspects **

**Introduction**

The active substance, Ofatumumab, is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against
CD20 and binds specifically to epitopes which encompass the amino residues 163 and 166 in the small
extracellular loop of the CD20 molecule epitopes on the human B cells.

Ofatumumab concentrated for solution for infusion, 20 mg/ml is clear, colourless solution filled into
Type I clear glass vial sealed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and aluminium overseals. Each vial
contains 5 ml of ofatumumab.. The medicinal product may contain visible particles and the product is
supplied with a commercially available polyether sulfone filter set. The filter set has a CE mark (CE
0086) in compliance with the Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC.

**Active Substance**

The active substance is ofatumumab, an IgG1 k human mAb which is produced from a recombinant
murine cell line (NSO). The molecular weight (MW) of the antibody is approximately 149 kDa (25

Page 5 of 63


-----

kDa of the light chain and 50 kDa of the heavy chain). The antibody is N-linked glycosylated at
ASN 302 of the heavy chain with varying amounts of terminal galactose.

- Manufacture

The manufacturing process starts with the thawing of cells from the NSO working cell bank (WCB).
During the cell culture stages, cells are progressively increased in number, prior to transfer into a
production bioreactor with controls, which include pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature

When harvest criteria are achieved, the bioreactor contents are clarified prior to further purification.
The different steps in the purification process include affinity and anion exchange chromtatography as
well as robust viral clearance steps that are capable of removing adventitious agents and other
contaminants. Following purification the active substance dispensed into sterile active substance
containers prior to testing and release.

Control of materials

Comprehensive lists of all materials used during the fermentation and purification of the ofatumumab
manufacturing process are given. Culture media are prepared from pre-formulated base powders
supplemented with chemically defined components. The qualitative composition of the base powders
is given.

The anti-CD20 antibody expressing murine cell line (SJT26) was generated via transgenic mouse and
hybridoma technology. The information provided on generation of the cell substrate is considered to
be adequate and sufficiently detailed.
Sufficient information is provided on the establishment and testing of MCB and WCB. Testing of the
MCB and WCB is acceptable and in accordance with relevant guidelines.

*MBC Testing* – Characterisation test performed on the MCB includes: viability, sterility by direct
inoculation, mycoplasma by agar and broth culture and Vero indicator cell procedures, Quantitative
TEM of sections for the detection of viruses, fungi, yeasts, bacteria and mycoplasma.

No infections ecotropic or xenotropic retroviruses were detected. Retrovirus like particle A and C type
have been detected. As is typical for NSO cell lines, a low level of murine leukaemia retrovirus
capable of reproducing was detected in the *Mus dunni* assay, but it was demonstrated to be incapable
of infecting the human cell line MRC-5 on co-cultivation with the SJT26 cell line.
No other viruses, virus like particles, mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi or yeasts were detected.

*WCB Testing* – WCB were tested for: viability, sterility by direct inoculation, mycoplasma by agar and
broth culture and Vero indicator cell procedures. No adventitious viral contaminants were detected.

A limit of cell age of 50.0 generations beyond MCB is established. Genetic stability of the cell line has
been demonstrated. Based on the results presented, this limit seems acceptable.

Process development and validation

In general, the ofatumumab active substance manufacturing process is considered well controlled and
validated. The process development and establishment of process controls/test are built on the current
understanding of the ICH, QbD concept. Information on the risk-matrix system has been provided and
the establishment of critical/non-critical process parameters are carefully outlined. The quality system
in place to evaluate derivations from Target Set Points/Acceptable range, Acceptance Criteria or a
CCP value outside the acceptable range has been indicated. No design space is claimed.

The consistency study has demonstrated that the cell culture, harvest and purification process is
routinely operated within predefined acceptance criteria.

Descriptions, supported with detailed tables, have been provided for all changes introduced over time
in the ofatumumab active substance manufacturing process at the various process steps. In total three
processes have been used, Process A, B and C. The changes introduced from Process A to Process B
and Process C have been sufficiently described. Comparability with regard to characterization has
overall been done by state-of the art methods and support that comparable ofatumumab active
substance material has been used throughout the non-clinical and clinical studies, and that this material
is comparable to the commercial material for the market.

-----

Validation studies were performed for the active substance, ofatumumab, manufacturing process to
define the quality attributes, operating parameters, control strategy, and to demonstrate process
consistency. Following process development and scale up, the commercial process was established
and a series of three batches (39575, 42873 and 45338) was run. Each batch was initiated from a
separate vial thaw and carried through to active substance.

For each step of the manufacturing process, process parameters that could affect the critical quality
attributes of active substance were evaluated and the range for these parameters during routine
manufacturing was established. These ranges were monitored to confirm that they remained within the
required limits.

An initial assessment of the applicability of the existing data (including experience with mAb
production using murine cell lines) were done to support set point and ranges for each process
parameter. Data were generated to justify process limits and evaluate the potential effect of each
process parameter on the quality of the product.

A Critical Process Parameter (CPP) matrix is used to evaluate each parameter and categorize the
magnitude of risk into three categories: high, medium and low, depending on whether the process
parameter has a high risk of adversely affecting the product quality, if operated outside a defined
acceptable range.

Process Limit Evaluation (PLE) studies were carried out for parameters where the CPP risk was
assigned “high” and where sufficient data did not exist to support the process ranges; therefore, data
from 4 to 6 commercial scale batches and 4 to 6 PLE studies, using small scale bioreactors, were
analyzed to confirm the acceptable range of the parameter investigated. No CPPs were identified for
the 4 steps of the cell culture and harvest process.

The consistency study data has demonstrated that the cell culture and harvest process is routinely
operated within predefined acceptance criteria and that the three consistency lots had comparable cell
growth kinetics, comparable ofatumumab concentrations and comparable purity.. From the study it
can be concluded that the ofatumumab active substance batches from the process of consistency series
are shown to be comparable to reference standard 31050/ARS. The data presented demonstrate that a
consistent quality of ofatumumab active substance is manufactured.

Specific validation studies conducted following written protocols were used to validate the active
substance manufacturing process. Validation studies were performed following production batch
records and standard operating procedures as appropriate. Validation studies were performed using the
commercial scale manufacture equipment, or where necessary, in small scale equipment designed to
simulate the conditions used at commercial scale manufactures.

- Specification

The specification and limits proposed by the Applicant for release of ofatumumab active substance is
based on data from the manufactured active substance lots and lots used in clinical trials.

Tests for purity, potency and identity are included, together with general tests such as appearance and
pH and oligosaccharide mapping. All methods have been appropriately validated.

A shelf-life specification for ofatumumab has been accepted based on the justification and data given.

- Stability

The proposed shelf - life of 24 months for ofatumumab when is stored at 5 ± ~~3~~ [o] C protected from light,
are acceptable as it is supported with full time; at scale and site, stability data for three batches from
the commercial Process C. No significant changes were observed in any of the stability indicating
parameters after storage at this condition, and all results met acceptance criteria.

The results obtained under accelerated (2 ~~5~~ [o] C) conditions for up to 12 months, and under stress (40 [o] C)
conditions for up to 6 months show that the active substance stability begins to decline at these

Page 7 of 63


-----

conditions. In addition, data generated following short term exposure to ICH photostability conditions
indicates that ofatumumab requires protection from light during storage.

**Medicinal Product**

Arzerra (ofatumumab) Concentrate for Solution for Infusion 20 mg/ml is a clear, colourless, aqueous
solution containing 20 mg/mL of ofatumumab in a 30 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.5 containing 100 mM
sodium chloride. Prior to administration, the product is diluted into an infusion bag containing isotonic
pyrogen free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Water for Injection is an inactive ingredient used as a
solvent for the components of the buffer. During administration of the intravenous infusion the
product solution is filtered through an in-line filter.

- Pharmaceutical Development

The development of the formulation and the DP manufacturing process is considered adequately
described. Excipients and primary container components are considered standard for the product type.
All excipients comply with Ph.Eur. and no animal/human on novel excipients are used. All analytical
procedures used to control the excipients are in compliance with Ph.Eur.

Early formulation development work was performed by testing the quality and stability of
ofatumumab in a variety of buffer systems over the pH range 4 to 8, suitable for intravenous infusion.
The composition of these buffers was based on manufacturing experience of suitable formulation for
biopharmaceuticals.

The formulations were stored at 5 [o] C, 25 [o] C, 40 [o] C and -20 [o] C. An aliquot of the samples stored at 5 [o] C
was agitated for 24h on an end over end rotary mixer and tested for aggregate formation. Samples
were also tested for purity and potency. Additionally, the formulation samples were checked for visual
appearance and presence of particles.

The study demonstrated that the sodium citrate buffer was the buffer system that showed best stability
of the ofatumumab molecule at 5 [o] C, 25 [o] C and 40 [o] C among the buffers tested. For the citrate buffer
samples, pH 5.0 had elevated levels of fragments on accelerated stability compared to the citrate
formulations at pH 5.5 or 6.5. For these reasons and because the 30 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM
sodium chloride, pH 6.5 formulation met all of the design requirements that particular formulation was
chosen. This formulation was used in all clinical trials for CLL and is proposed for commercial
manufacture.

The formulation choice has also been validated by stability. The formulation maintains stability of
ofatumumab when stored under the recommended condition. Besides biochemical stability, the
potency of ofatumumab, as measured by the Potency assay is maintained throughout its shelf-life. The
Potency assay has been shown to be very sensitive assay to detect changes in ofatumumab activity.

- Adventitious Agents

The cell banks (MCB and WCB) are sufficiently characterised and tested for adventitious agents.

Production bioreactor on day of harvest is routinely tested (in process control) for adventitious viruses.

Four viruses have been included in the virus validation study. A sufficient and acceptable rationale is
given for the four viruses used in the virus validation study and virus reduction factor of at least Log 10

- 11 is demonstrated for viruses.

Viral and microbiological safety of the ofatumumab active substance is considered assured.

- Manufacture of the Product

The proposed commercial manufacturing process employed comprises the following process steps:
preparation of dilution buffer, preparation of bulk solution, filling, inspection and packaging. The
filling overage has been justified and comparability has been adequately described.

Page 8 of 63


-----

The manufacturing process involves pooling active substance in an appropriate vessel and diluting to
the target concentration with a matched buffer solution. After mixing, the solution is filtered through a
0.45 μm filter and a 0.2 μm sterile filter into a holding vessel and aseptically filled into vials.

The critical steps of the medicinal product manufacturing process are controlled by the in-process
controls. These in-process controls are described and justified. There are no intermediate products in
the manufacturing process.

The representative batch formula is provided for the medicinal product and also for the dilution buffer
solution. Three commercial scale batches of medicinal product have been manufactured according to
the proposed commercial manufacturing process at the proposed commercial site.

Validation of equipment sterilisation process, aseptic filling (media fill, Tryptone soya broth),
container closure integrity (microbiological challenge study), filters, re-processing process hold time
analysis, has also been performed. The hold time analysis provides a limit for holding product outside
of cold storage for a cumulative time that should have no detrimental effect on quality.

- Product Specification

The proposed list of specifications is considered acceptable and in accordance with Ph.Eur.
01/2008:2013 “Monoclonal antibodies for human use” and relevant guidelines. No new impurities are
formed during manufacture of the medicinal product and the purity/impurity profile for the medicinal
product is comparable to active substance.

The endotoxin test and the sterility test have been qualified according to Ph.Eur.

The proposed specification for appearance is: “Clear, colourless liquid. Visible particles may be
present”. This is not fully in accordance with Ph.Eur. monograph 2031 “Monoclonal antibodies for
human use”, which states that the appearance should be “Without visible particles”. However,
according to Ph.Eur. monograph 0520 “Parenteral preparations”, infusions should be “Practically free
from particles”. It has been demonstrated that the visible particles are product-related protein particles
and there are no changes in protein content. As the product is dosed with an in-line filter, neither
safety nor efficacy is affected by the presence of visible particles. The specification for appearance is
therefore considered acceptable.

A shelf-life specification has been proposed for the medicinal product. The shelf-life specifications are
identical to the release specification. This is considered acceptable as a commitment has been given by
GSK to revise the specification 2 years post approval.

The medicinal product is supplied in Type I clear glass vials sealed with bromobutyl rubber stoppers
and aluminium overseals. Each vial contains 5 ml of ofatumumab, 20 mg/ml. The vial and stopper are
in compliance with Ph.Eur.

- Stability of the Product

The proposed shelf - life of 24 months at 2 - 8 [o] C, protect from light and do not freeze is based on 12
months stability data for the primary batches and 24 months data for the supportive batches.
Comparability of DP manufactured at different sites during development is demonstrated by batch
analyses data. The proposed medicinal product shelf-life is acceptable.

The results of accelerated and long-term stability studies for the primary stability batches demonstrate
chemical and physical stability and equivalence to the supportive stability batches over the same 6
months span. Stability data form the supportive stability batches demonstrate the overall quality,
purity and potency are retained over 24 months at the recommended storage temperature of 5±3 [o] C.

In the SPC it is stated that chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at
ambient conditions (less than 25 [o] C). Based on data provided, this is considered acceptable.

GMP Status : The sites used for medicinal product and active substance manufacture, release and
stability testing have been inspected and accepted.

### **2.3 Non-clinical aspects **

**Introduction**

Primary pharmacology studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice and a secondary
pharmacology study was conducted to examine the efficacy of ofatumumab in a mouse model of
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Based on cross-reactivity studies and cDNA analysis it was determined that
cynomolgus monkey was suitable as test species in the nonclinical safety studies, but not mouse, rat or
dog.
Preliminary toxicology and toxicokinetic studies were in general performed in accordance with the
principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). All definitive toxicology and toxicokinetic studies
were performed in full compliance with GLP regulations.

**Pharmacology**

- Primary pharmacodynamics

Many of the primary pharmacology studies used the commercially available, type-I anti-CD20
antibody, rituximab (Mabthera), as a comparator.
Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled ofatumumab bound to human peripheral blood
mononuclear cell CD20 (3 donors) with a mean EC 50 value of 287±12.7 ng/mL. Similar numbers of
iodinated ofatumumab and rituximab antibodies bound to CD20 on B-cell lymphoma cell lines, as
shown by the similar levels of binding saturation. To exclude the possibility that the iodinated
monoclonal antibodies bound via Fc-receptors, binding curves were confirmed using anti-CD20
F(ab’)2 fragments (data not shown).
Epitope mapping studies using a mutagenesis approach have indicated that the amino acid residues
alanine at position 170 (A170) and proline at position 172 (P172) in the second extracellular loop are
critical for the recognition of human CD20 by known anti-CD20 antibodies, including rituximab

[Polyak 2002]. To determine which amino acids are involved in ofatumumab binding to CD20,
sequential single substitutions of human for mouse amino acids along the extracellular regions of
CD20 have been conducted (site-directed mutagenesis). Replacement of the amino acid residues at
positions 163 and 166 strongly reduced the binding of ofatumumab whereas binding of rituximab was
unaffected. Mutating threonine to lysine at position 159 did not influence the binding of either
antibody. However, triple mutations at positions 159, 163 and 166 completely abrogated the binding
of ofatumumab and reduced the binding of rituximab (data not shown).
Ofatumumab and rituximab epitope mapping was also performed in a Pepscan-based ELISA using
overlapping, mostly 15-mer synthesized peptides comprising the extracellular loops of CD20. In this
study, ofatumumab bound to peptides N-terminal of A170/P172 in the second extracellular loop of
CD20. It also bound to peptides derived from the small extracellular CD20 loop. Rituximab
recognised peptides centred around A170/P172 but showed little or no reactivity with peptides located
to the N-terminal side of A170/P172 on the large extracellular loop or the small loop of CD20 (data
not shown).
Cells from different tumour B-cell lines (Daudi, ARH77, Raji, DOHH and Su-DHL-4) were preincubated with CD20-specific antibodies, before the addition of normal human serum, which induces
CDC. Cell lysis was determined by measuring the number of propidium iodide positive cells by flow
cytometry. Ofatumumab lysed >80% of cells in all tested cell lines. Rituximab lysed >80% Daudi and
Su-DHL-4 cells and between 20-50% of cells in the remaining three cell lines (data not shown).
Complement inhibitors such as CD55 and CD59 appear to play an important role in the susceptibility
to rituximab-induced CDC [Golay, 2001]. To study the role of CD55 and CD59 in anti-CD20
mediated CDC, both complement inhibitor molecules were blocked by specific antibodies prior to
induction of CDC. Blocking of CD55 did not affect ofatumumab mediated CDC, while the addition of
a CD59 antibody appeared to slightly increase the CDC-mediated lysis. Similarly, the results indicated
that blocking of CD59 increased the cells susceptibility to rituximab, while no increase in efficacy was
observed following CD55 blocking.
Flow cytometry analysis showed that FITC-conjugated anti-C1q antibody binds to ofatumumab-bound
B-cells to a higher extent than rituximab-bound B-cells. However, in an ELISA assay, human C1q
bound to immobilised ofatumumab and rituximab to the same extent. Moreover, fixation of C4c

Page 10 of 63

(indicator of complement activation via classical route) after ofatumumab binding was higher than
after rituximab binding. Similar binding of complement factor C3 to ofatumumab and rituximab was
observed in an ELISA assay.
In order to investigate the impact of CD20 expression levels on ofatumumab-induced CDC,
experiments were performed in CD20-transfected human CEM T cells, which lack endogenous CD20
expression. To this end, a panel of CD20-transfected human CEM T cell clones expressing different
amounts of CD20 (4500 to 135,000 molecules/cell) was generated. Ofatumumab achieved complete
lysis of any cell line expressing more than 60,000 molecules of CD20 and lysed approximately 18% of
cells expressing as few as 4500 CD20 molecules/cell. Rituximab did not reach maximal lysis against
clones expressing the highest levels of CD20 and showed CDC activity towards cells expressing at
least 30,000 CD20 molecules/cell (data not shown).
51 Cr-labelled target cells, namely ARH-77 (a tumour B cell line), B cell acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (B ALL) cells after five rounds of subcloning, or fresh tumour B cells from various sources

[B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), hairy cell leukaemia, follicular lymphoma and primary
mantle cell lymphoma], were incubated with ofatumumab or rituximab (0.01 to 10 μg/mL).
Subsequently, effector cells in the form of polymorphonuclear cells, mononuclear cells or whole blood
was added. [51] Cr release was measured using a gamma counter and used as an indicator of target cell
lysis. In the presence of polymorphonuclear cells, minimal specific lysis was observed of ARH-77
cells and fresh tumour cells. However, in the presence of mononuclear cells, ofatumumab and
rituximab mediated lysis of ARH-77 cells, CLL cells, B-ALL cells and hairy cell leukaemia cells to a
similar extent, indicating that a similar fraction of cells was susceptible to ADCC by both antibodies.
Neither antibody was able to induce ADCC-mediated lysis of follicular lymphoma or primary mantle
cell lymphoma cells (data not shown).
It was further investigated how the cytotoxic effects of ofatumumab relate to the target occupancy. It
was shown that ADCC induction reached its maximum level (51% lysis) at an ofatumumab
concentration of about 0.1  g/mL, which corresponds to the concentration at which half-maximal
target occupancy was achieved. In contrast, maximum CDC (68% cell lysis) was only achieved at
complete target occupancy (saturation).
Induction of apoptosis is an alternative mechanism by which anti-CD20 antibodies could kill tumour B
cells [Johnson, 2003]. Therefore the ability of ofatumumab and rituximab (0.1-10 µg/mL) to induce
apoptosis of Daudi or Raji cells was investigated in an Annexin-V apopotosis assay. Neither
ofatumumab nor rituximab was able to induce significant apoptosis in Raji cells. Around 15% and
30% apoptotic Daudi cells was seen following incubation with ofatumumab and rituximab,
respectively. In contrast, the positive control mouse anti-human CD20 antibody, B1, was a strong
inducer of apoptosis in both cell lines (data not shown).
Homotypic aggregation correlates with the induction of apoptosis [Polyak, 2008], therefore, the ability
of ofatumumab to induce homotypic aggregation of Daudi cells was investigated. Light microscopic
evaluations showed that ofatumumab does not induce homotypic aggregation of Daudi cells, while
rituximab induces minimal cell aggregation. The positive control antibody, B1, was a strong inducer
of homotypic aggregation (data not shown).
Rapid complement activation has been suggested to underlie the first dose side effects of rituximab
due to the release of inflammatory mediators such as the complement split products (anaphylotoxins)
C4a, C3a and C5a [Van der Kolk 2001]. Analysis using C4a, C3a, and C5a antibody-coated
cytometric beads and flow cytometry showed that ofatumumab had a tendency to induce higher levels
of C4a, C3a and C5a during complement activation than rituximab (data not shown).
The induction of CD20 translocation into lipid rafts by anti-CD20 antibodies is considered to be an
important mechanism for inducing cell signalling and complement activation [Deans, 1998; Teeling
2004]. It was shown that both ofatumumab and rituximab induce clustering of targeted CD20.
Moreover, based on a series of *in vitro* assays, it was concluded that ofatumumab and rituximab
treatment of Daudi lymphoma cells, induce the clustering of CD20 into lipid rafts to a similar extent
(data not shown).
The potential therapeutic effects of ofatumumab *in vivo* were examined in severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse tumour xenograft models.
The first set of experiments assessed survival following a high dose of ofatumumab or rituximab.
SCID mice (n=5/group) were IV inoculated with a human tumour B cell line (2.5 x 10 [6] cells) and 7
days later given vehicle or 100  g of ofatumumab or rituximab by IV bolus injection. Survival was
recorded as the end-point of the study. Ofatumumab treatment of mice injected with one of the cell

lines resulted in 60% survival at the end of the experiment (100 days after the injection of tumour
cells). Rituximab did not prevent death, with the mice dying between 50 to 83 days after tumour
injection (data not shown).
To investigate the dose-effect relationship, groups of SCID mice (n=4 or 5/group) were injected with
2 x 10 [6] cells of a second B cell line expressing higher levels of CD20 followed 7 days later by the
vehicle or 0.1, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 or 20  g of ofatumumab or rituximab. A dose-dependent prolongation of
survival was noted following treatment with ofatumumab at  2  g per mouse (~80 µg/kg). Rituximab
did not exert a dose-dependent effect on survival (data not shown).
Ofatumumab was subsequently evaluated in studies using a SCID mouse model in which disseminated
outgrowth of human B cell tumours was followed by quantitative bioluminescence imaging. In these
studies, 2 x 10 [6] cells of a B-cell line transfected with firefly luciferase were injected IV into SCID
mice. Several days after cell inoculation, the animals received ofatumumab, rituximab or the isotype
control antibody, HuMab-KLH, by IP administration. In an experimental set up in which the animals
(n=6/group) received a low dose of antibody (0.5 mg/kg) 8 days after cell inoculation, both
ofatumumab and rituximab significantly inhibited tumour growth relative to the control (data not
shown).
In another experimental set up in which mice (n=9/group) were treated much later (on Day 14), there
was no difference in therapeutic efficacy between ofatumumab and rituximab (0.5 and 50 mg/kg).
Ofatumumab and rituximab were also equally effective in mice (n=6/group) administered 0.5 mg/kg
on Day 5 or Day 14 (n=6/group). Notably, both antibodies were more effective when administered
early after cell inoculation (i.e. on Day 5) than when administered late after inoculation (i.e. on Day
14, data not shown).
Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that differences in efficacy between ofatumumab and rituximab,
where they occurred, could not be explained by differences in IgG plasma levels.
It was found that ofatumumab binding to CD20 expressing B-cell lymphoma cell lines was not
affected by deglycosylation. However, N-linked glycosylation of ofatumumab was essential for
binding of C1q to the Fc portion of the antibody and consequently for the ability to induce CDC.
Hence, C4 deposition was eliminated following ofatumumab deglycosylation. Moreover, preliminary
data suggested that deglycosylation decreased Fc  RIIIa-158V binding to ofatumumab. Binding
affinity of antibodies to Fcγ receptor IIIa has been shown to correlate with their potency to induce
ADCC *in vitro* [Bleeker 2008; Carter 2006].
Similarly, changing the galactose content of ofatumumab did not affect its binding to CD20 expressing
B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Changing the galactose content of ofatumumab reduced its ability to
induce CDC in certain cell lines but not in others. Moreover, degalactosylation of ofatumumab
reduced complement C1q binding and consequently C3 and C4 deposition (data not shown).
No difference in anti-tumour efficacy was observed in SCID xenograft mice IP treated with 500  g/kg
of ofatumumab or degalactosylated ofatumumab (n=9/group). Hence, the minor non-clinical effect of
ofatumumab degalactosylation on CDC and Fc  RIIIa-158V binding (ADCC) did not translate into an
*in vivo* effect on treatment efficacy (data not shown).
Based on immunohistochemistry, ofatumumab and rituximab display similar cellular binding (B-cell
follicles) in the tonsils of humans and cynomolgus monkeys. In contrast, ofatumumab did not bind to
spleen sections obtained from mouse, rat, rabbit, pig and dog. Based on flow cytometry data,
ofatumumab has a slightly higher affinity for cynomolgus monkey than human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (EC 50 values of 139 and 287 ng/mL, respectively). In addition, the cDNA sequence
of the second extracellular loop of cynomolgus monkey CD20 was determined and the amino
sequence compared to that of human CD20. A single amino acid change was noted at position 158
(Ala human -Val cyno ).

- Secondary pharmacodynamics

In a secondary pharmacology study, the efficacy of ofatumumab in a mouse model of rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) was examined. In patients with RA, large numbers of immune cells infiltrate the
hyperplastic synovial tissue of the chronically inflamed joint, forming the so-called pannus, which
erodes subjacent cartilage and bone. According to the applicant, the most important of the
autoantibodies implicated in the condition are those against cyclic citrullinated proteins (anti-CCP
antibodies), which are thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease.
To evaluate the effectiveness of ofatumumab in the depletion of B cells and plasma cells responsible
for the production of autoantibodies, SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously with human synovial
tissue from patients with RA and intravenously administered 30 mg/kg of anti-KLH (control antibody)
or ofatumumab between Days 7 and 9 after engraftment. Mice were implanted with synovium from
anti-CCP [+] or anti-CCP [-] RA patients. Grafts were explanted at various time points (Days 14, 22, 81 or
91) and stained by immunohistochemistry for B cells and other types of immune cells. Serum levels of
human IgG and anti-CPP antibodies were measured by ELISA.
Only mice engrafted with tissue from anti-CCP [+] RA patients developed antibody titers against CCP. In
general, there was no effect of ofatumumab on the human IgG titers. The applicant argued that the
plasma cells, which are not affected by anti-CD20 antibodies, present at the time of treatment may be
responsible for the majority of human antibody production in this model and concluded that assessing
human antibody serum levels does not represent a sensitive measurement for B cell depletion in this
model. However, ofatumumab efficiently depleted B cells in synovial tissue in one experiment, in
which grafts were explanted early enough (after 14 days) to allow immunohistochemical analysis.

A large number of tissues from three unrelated patient donors were examined in a human crossreactivity study. Sections of each sample of tissue from each donor were incubated with FITC-labelled
ofatumumab at 0.5, 5.0 and 20.0 μg/ml. All tissue samples were treated with an antigen marker
appropriate for each tissue in order to confirm the preservation of antigens in that tissue.
Specific, positive, membrane bound staining was recorded in lymphocytes of the lymph node, spleen,
thymus and tonsil and also in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of the small and large
intestines in donors where lymphoid tissue had been sampled, at all concentrations of the test
antibody. In addition there was positive membrane bound staining of lymphocytes scattered in the
subepithelial tissue of at least one donor of cervix, endometrium, kidney, prostate, parotid salivary
gland, skin, stomach, ureter and urinary bladder at all concentrations of the test antibody.

- Safety pharmacology programme

Page 13 of 63


-----

No specific safety pharmacology studies were submitted. However, some safety pharmacology end
points, such as cardiovascular and renal parameters and body temperature, were evaluated as part of
the pivotal 4 week and 7 month repeat dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys.
No changes in body temperature were observed in the 4 week repeat-dose toxicity study at doses up to
100 mg/kg. There were no treatment-related changes in heart rate or QT interval in either investigation
at doses up to 100 mg/kg.
Urinalysis parameters (volume, specific gravity, pH, protein, blood pigments, glucose, ketones,
urobilinogen and bilirubin; microscopic examination of the spun deposit) were evaluated at intervals
throughout the 4 week and 7 month studies and showed no changes related to treatment with
ofatumumab (see repeat dose toxicity studies).

- Pharmacodynamic drug interactions

No studies were submitted. Such investigations were considered by the Applicant as unnecessary, as
ofatumumab is a biologic with high specificity and affinity for CD20, and it was felt very unlikely that
it would affect other pharmacologically relevant targets.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Conventional pharmacokinetic studies are not applicable to monoclonal antibodies like ofatumumab in
accordance with the ICH S6 guideline on preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived
pharmaceuticals.
No specific pharmacokinetic studies were submitted by the applicant. All pharmacokinetic/
toxicokinetic parameters were obtained as part of repeat dose toxicology studies of up to 7 months
duration in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis). The majority of studies were performed by
the IV route (infusion over 30 minutes) as this is the clinical route of administration; however, the SC
route of administration was also examined in a single study. The potential for the transfer of
ofatumumab across the placenta was evaluated as part of an embryofetal development study.
In terms of analytical methods, different ELISA methods were developed to detect ofatumumab and
rituximab in cynomolgus monkey plasma and serum as well as anti-ofatumumab antibodies (data not
shown).
The pharmacokinetic data obtained during the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in cynomolgus
monkeys are summarised in the following table 4.

**Table 4: PK data obtained** **f** **r** **om t** **oxicokinetic data in the toxicity studies**

Since ofatumumab is an antibody, conventional absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
studies as well as pharmacokinetic interaction studies were not submitted (see discussion on nonclinical aspects).

Depletion of CD20 [+] cells was not included in the table above as this finding was considered a
pharmacological effect of ofatumumab. In general, depletion of CD20+ cells in the peripheral blood
was detected already after the second administration and seemed to continue throughout the dosing
period. In the recovery animals, the time needed before B-cell levels returned to baseline levels
appeared to depend upon the dose, i.e. high dose animals recovered later than low dose animals.
Depletion of CD20 [+] cells in biopsies taken from the lymph nodes seemed to be consistent with those
seen in peripheral blood. The depletion of CD20 [+] cells occurred regardless of the route of
administration (IV versus SC) and whether ofatumumab was administered daily, weekly, monthly or
cyclically.
Ofatumumab treatment did not change the pool of other cell phenotypes, including T and NK cells,
within the blood or lymph node compartments. In addition, there were no changes in neutrophil or
monocyte populations. Immunisation of monkeys with keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) following
chronic IV infusion administration of ofatumumab resulted in detectable immune responses, although
the magnitude of the IgG humoral immune response was reduced in monkeys dosed at 20 and
100 mg/kg. No effects on delayed type hypersensitivity reactions were noted at doses of ofatumumab
up to and including 100 mg/kg (as assessed by immunisation with commercially available antigens,
i.e., diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mix).
Increases in reticulocytes and lactate dehydrogenase, and decreases in haemoglobin concentration,
haematocrit concentration and red blood cell count were indicative of haemolytic anaemia. A review
of haemolytic events indicated that the majority of treated animals were experiencing a slowly
developing haemolytic anaemia during both the dosing and recovery periods, and that this was
associated with a progressive, dose-related increase in lactate dehydrogenase that was reversible.
Furthermore, the direct Coombs’ test results suggested that the monkeys probably developed
antibodies to ofatumumab, which induced the formation of immune complexes and complement
activation and was followed by binding of the complexes via the complement binding CR1 receptor to
the surface of the red blood cells. This is likely to have resulted in sequestration in the spleen by
macrophages leading to haemolytic anaemia. The cynomolgus monkey red blood cell surface contains
approximately 7 times the number of CR1 epitopes found on human red blood cells [Edberg, 1992;
Hebert, 1992], and according to the applicant this may have accentuated the observed haemolytic
anaemia in the cynomolgus monkeys.
In the pivotal 7 month repeat-dose toxicity study (GLP), there were five monkeys that were either
humanely sacrificed or found dead at both dose levels, none of these were attributable to direct
toxicity of the test item. The reasons for animal withdrawal can be categorised into those which had a
probable *Campylobacter jejuni* ( *C. jejuni* ) infection and those which showed signs of haemolytic
anaemia.

- Genotoxicity

No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

- Carcinogenicity

No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

- Reproduction Toxicity

No studies on fertility and no peri- and post-natal toxicology studies were submitted (see discussion on
non-clinical aspects).
In an embryofoetal development study, ofatumumab was administered iv to pregnant cynomolgus
monkeys from day 20 to 50 of gestation (period of organogenesis). The animals received 0, 20 or 100
mg/kg once weekly (i.e. a total of 5 administrations). Foetuses were delivered via caesarean section
and euthanized on day 100 ± 1 of gestation.
There were no unscheduled deaths during the study. The incidence of prenatal loss was also unaffected
by treatment. No treatment-related effect was detected in pregnant females with respect to clinical
observations, weight or haematology. A significant and almost complete depletion of peripheral
CD20/CD40-positive B-cells was observed in all ofatumumab-treated dams at day 25 post coitum (the

Page 17 of 63

earliest time point evaluated after dosing). Following the recovery period, the depletion of B-cells was
still present.
There were no ofatumumab-related changes in fetal body weights or dimensions, placental weights, or
foetal abnormalities. A reduction in spleen weights was observed for foetuses in the 100 mg/kg dose
group, but no correlating microscopic changes were noted. A decrease in B cells was observed in
foetal cord blood collected from the foetuses of animals in both dose groups, and B cell-depletion was
noted in splenic tissue from the foetuses.
Ofatumumab was present in maternal plasma up to Gestation Day 100 and was also detectable in 17 of
20 umbilical cord blood samples from the foetuses, confirming exposure to ofatumumab during late
pregnancy (GD100). The mean plasma AUC value for maternal ofatumumab exposure was 1646000
µg*h/mL. Antibodies against ofatumumab were detected in 3 of 24 female monkeys (2 of 12 animals
dosed at 20 mg/kg and 1 of 12 animals dosed at 100 mg/kg). Moreover, anti-ofatumumab antibodies
were detected in 3 of 24 dams and in 3 of 20 fetal cord blood samples.

- Local tolerance

No separate studies assessing local tolerance to ofatumumab were submitted as macroscopic or
microscopic examinations of the injection sites were conducted following intravenous and
subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg/kg of ofatumumab to cynomolgus monkeys as part of the
repeat dose toxicology studies. No macroscopic of microscopic findings of local irritation were noted
in any of these investigations.

- Other toxicity studies

*Immunotoxicity.* The activation and release of inflammatory and coagulation parameters was
investigated following administration of ofatumumab to cynomolgus monkeys (GMB-3001-013). The
blood samples used in this study were derived from the pilot dose-ranging toxicity study, in which
cynomolgus monkeys (1 male or female per group) were given ofatumumab by intravenous infusion
(30 minutes) at doses of 25, 50, 75 or 100 mg/kg on Day 1 (23315). Serum samples were taken prior
to dosing and at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-dose, and the levels of complement
factors C3b/c and C4b/c, thrombin-anti-thrombin III complex (TAT), plasmin  2-anti-plasmin
complex (PAP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), elastase-  1-antitrypsin complex (HNE/ATc, a marker for
neutrophil degranulation), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF  ) were determined using ELISA

assays.
An increase of C3b/c (activated form of C3) was noted in all monkeys at 15 minutes post-dose, but 2
to 4 hours later the level of C3b/c had decreased. C4b/c (activated form of C4) showed a similar
increase following ofatumumab administration. TAT complex levels in the circulation increased in all
monkeys at 15 minutes post-dose, but the increase was variable with the monkey treated at 50 mg/kg
showing the greatest increase. PAP levels in the circulation increased in all animals but in 3 out of 4
animals, plasmin formation was transient. Neutrophil degranulation was observed in 3 of 4 animals,
but the increase was very mild in the 25 mg/kg dose group. IL-6, one of the cytokines that increases
most in humans under inflammatory conditions, appeared to follow a biphasic course, with the early
increase possibly related to complement activation and the later increase to cellular activation. TNF 
levels were measured but were below the limit of detection. These results suggest that administration
of ofatumumab may be associated with cytokine release syndrome. However, the severity of this
syndrome in the monkeys was limited and clinical manifestations were not observed.

*Immunogenicity.* The formation of anti-ofatumumab antibodies was investigated as part of the repeat
dose toxicity studies and the embryofetal development study by the use of two ELISA assays. ADAs
were detected in all of the studies where analyses were undertaken following both intravenous and
subcutaneous dosing (data not shown, see discussion of non-clinical aspects).

**Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment**

No environmental risk assessment was submitted (see discussion of non-clinical aspects).

**Discussion on the non-clinical aspects**

In vitro binding studies indicated the specific binding of ofatumumab to CD20 and that ofatumumab
binds to a CD20 epitope somewhat overlapping and somewhat distinct from that of rituximab.

Further in vitro experiments investigated the mechanisms of ofatumumab cytotoxicity and suggested
that CDC and ADCC, but not apoptosis, mediate the cytotoxic effect. Generation of complement
activation products (anaphylotoxins) and translocation of CD20 into lipid rafts, but not homotypic
aggregation of B-cell line cells, were induced by ofatumumab. In vivo, ofatumumab was able to
protect SCID mice from implanted B-cell line tumours.
Since ofatumumab is a biotechnology-derived product with highly specific receptor targeting, it was
considered sufficient that safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated as part of the toxicology
studies.

Although no formal interaction studies have been performed with Arzerra, there are no known
clinically significant interactions with other medicinal products. Live attenuated or inactivated vaccine
efficacy may be impaired with ofatumumab (see Discussion on Clinical Safety).

It has been described in the literature that statin (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor) treatment decreases
CD20 epitope accessibility due to cholesterol depletion and this can lead to reduced binding and
activity of ofatumumab [Golab, 2007]. Monitoring of the potential for drug-drug interactions between
ofatumumab and anti-hypercholesterolemic drugs such as statins is included in the Risk Management
Plan (See section 3.5 Pharmacovigilance).

An ELISA was used for the quantification of ofatumumab in monkey serum and plasma. For the
detection of anti-ofatumumab antibodies in monkeys administered with ofatumumab, several
approaches were undertaken. Two ELISA methods were used in most studies; the F(ab’)2 binding
antibody preclinical assay and the whole ofatumumab binding antibody preclinical assay. For both
assays several concerns were raised regarding the design and the validation of the methods, especially
since the presence of ofatumumab seems to interfere with the detection of anti-ofatumumab antibodies
even at low concentrations. The applicant did not provide adequate answers to these concerns. Thus,
the results from the toxicity studies monitoring anti-ofatumumab antibodies and serum levels of
ofatumumab should be interpreted with caution.

In accordance with the ICH S6 guideline, the lack of metabolism and excretion studies is acceptable.
The lack of distribution studies is justified by 1) the fact that ofatumumab targets the CD20 molecule,
whose tissue expression is characterized 2) the fact that toxicokinetic data indicate limited distribution
beyond the plasma compartment and 3) the human cross-reactivity study indicates no potential for offtarget binding.

The lack of single-dose toxicity studies is acceptable in accordance with the concept paper on single
dose/acute toxicity (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/302413/2008).

In repeat-dose toxicity studies, haemolytic anaemia developed in cynomolgus monkeys, leading to
unscheduled deaths. The Applicant ascribed the development of the haemolytic anaemia to formation
of anti-ofatumumab antibodies, but this remains speculative and a potential clinical relevance cannot
be excluded. Haemolytic anaemia has been included as a potential risk in the RMP.

Although no thromboembolic events have been reported in the monkey studies, increased thrombinanti-thrombin / plasmin-anti-plasmin ratios were observed, indicating that ofatumumab may constitute
a risk for thromboembolic complications. However, a plausible explanation for the observed effects is
a mild, infusion related response without effects on the coagulation system, as apparent by unchanged
platelet counts. The data presented do not indicate an increased risk of procoagulating events
following the use of ofatumumab. Since thromboembolic events will be monitored through routine
pharmacovigilance activities, and since cardiovascular effects are an identified risk of ofatumumab
(included in the proposed Risk Management Plan), this is considered acceptable.

The lack of genotoxicity studies is considered justified according to ICH S6, while the Applicant
justified the lack of carcinogenicity studies by claiming that 1) ofatumumab is not expected to interact
directly with DNA or other chromosomal material, 2) ofatumumab is not pharmacologically active in
rodents and so the standard carcinogenicity bioassays are unsuitable, 3) there is no scientific evidence
to suggest that depletion of B cells by any other anti-CD20 therapeutics leads to cancer, and 4)
populations of NK cells, which are central to immune surveillance, did not change during pivotal
repeat dose studies of up to 7 months duration. The justification for not submitting carcinogenicity
studies was considered acceptable and the lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data is described in
section 5.3 of the SPC.

Considering that the median survival of CLL patients is 10 years, an evaluation of fertility as well as
pre- and post-natal development could theoretically be relevant. However, it was considered
acceptable that fertility and pre- and post natal development studies were not submitted due to 1) the
lack of ofatumumab off-target binding, 2) the lack of CD20 expression in reproductive tissues, 3) the

Page 20 of 63


-----

fact that antibodies does not appear to be able to cross the healthy blood-testis barrier, 4) the lack of a
role for B-cells in organ system development, 5) the age of the patient population (median age of 65 to
70 years old), and 6) the lack of ofatumumab affinity for CD20 in rodents and rabbits. The lack of
animal (and human) fertility data is reflected in section 4.6 of the SPC.

No maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity or teratogenicity was observed following IV
administration of up to 100 mg/kg ofatumumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once weekly from
day 20 to 50 of gestation. The mean maternal plasma exposure corresponds to 2.4-fold the clinical
exposure following administration of 2 gram ofatumumab. As expected, ofatumumab induced nearly
complete B-cell depletion in the pregnant females. Moreover, a decrease in B cells was observed in
foetal cord blood collected from the foetuses of animals in both dose groups, and B cell-depletion was
noted in splenic tissue from the foetuses. These data and relevant warnings on pregnancy (and
lactation) are included in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SPC.

The results of the immunogenicity analyses should be interpreted with caution due to limitations in the
detection methods (ELISA assays). Moreover, it is agreed that formation of primate anti-human
antibodies (PAHAs) is not predictive of the immunogenicity of the human antibody in patients. As
mentioned above, the potential of PAHAs to have induced the haemolytic anaemia observed in the
repeat-dose dose toxicity studies remains speculative, but monitoring of haemolytic anaemia has been
included in the Risk Management Plan.

As a protein, ofatumumab is exempted under current guidance from the need for a detailed
environmental assessment.
### **2.4 Clinical aspects **

**Introduction**

The clinical documentation submitted in support of this application comprises primarily data from a
pre-planned interim analysis of a single arm, open-label, multi-center ongoing pivotal study, HxCD20-406. Additional supportive evidence is provided by a phase I/II study, Hx-CD20-402.
The proposed indication was: ‘treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who
have failed therapy with a fludarabine containing regimen and have failed therapy with, or are
inappropriate for, an alemtuzumab containing regimen’. The finally approved indication is: ‘treatment
of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab’. The
recommended dose is 300 mg Arzerra for the first infusion and 2000 mg Arzerra for all subsequent
infusions. The infusion schedule is 8 consecutive weekly infusions, followed 4-5 weeks later by
4 consecutive monthly (i.e. every 4 weeks) infusions. Dosing recommendations on first and second
infusions, subsequent infusions, dose modification, reinitiation of therapy, and recommendations about
special populations are described in the SPC (see Section 4.2).
A paediatric class waiver for CLL was issued on 14 July 2008 - confirmation number EMEA/18/2008
Arzerra is not recommended for use in children below 18 years due to insufficient data on safety
and/or efficacy.
No studies in special populations, such as elderly, males/females or ethnic groups were submitted.

**GCP**

The pivotal study HX-CD20-406 and the supportive study HX-CD20-402 are stated to have been
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Pharmacokinetics were assessed in the course of the efficacy/safety studies supporting the current
application as well as the development of ofatumumab in other indications. A total of six clinical
studies with pharmacokinetics objectives and endpoints were submitted, with 433 subject receiving
ofatumumab (Table 7). Moreover, a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis and a

Page 21 of 63


-----

cross-study analysis of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were made using data from studies 001, 402,
403 Part A and B and 406. In the former analysis, data from study 406 were only available for 53
patients, compared to 129 patients in the latter analysis.

**Table 7: Listing of all clinical pharmacokinetic studies**

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a so called sandwich immuno-assay, was used for
the quantification of ofatumumab in human serum. Several approaches were used to establish a
method to monitor the development of anti-ofatumumab antibodies in patients, but only two ELISA
assays were used to test samples from the clinical trials. The difference between the two is the
specificity of the anti-ofatumubab antibody molecule detected. In the so called F(ab’)2 binding
antibody clinical assay, only antibodies against the antigen-binding region or F(ab’)2 fragment of
ofatumumab are detected, while the whole ofatumumab binding antibody clinical assay detects
antibodies against any portion of the ofatumumab molecule. The latter was used in the pivotal efficacy
study Hx-CD20-406.

- Absorption

Ofatumumab is administered by intravenous infusion. Maximum ofatumumab serum concentrations
were generally observed at or shortly after the end of the infusion. In the pivotal efficacy trial (Study
Hx-CD20-406), pharmacokinetic data were available from 146 patients with refractory CLL. The
geometric mean C max value was 63  g/ml after the first infusion (300 mg); after the eighth weekly
infusion (seventh infusion of 2000 mg), the geometric mean C max value was 1482  g/ml and geometric

mean AUC (0-  ) value was 674,463  g.h/ml; after the twelfth infusion (fourth monthly infusion;
2000 mg), the geometric mean C max value was 881  g/ml and geometric mean AUC (0-  ) was
265,707  g.h/ml.

- Distribution

Ofatumumab had a small volume of distribution (geometric mean Vss values ranged from 1.7 to 5.1 L
across studies, dose levels, and infusion number. This is consistent with distribution largely in the
systemic circulation.

- Elimination

Ofatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-independent route as with other IgG molecules and a
target-mediated route which is related to binding to B cells.
There was a rapid and sustained depletion of CD20+ B cells after the first ofatumumab infusion,
leaving a reduced number of CD20+ cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions.
As a result, ofatumumab clearance values were lower and t½ values were significantly larger after
later infusions than after the initial infusion.
Clearance and half-life values from the two studies in subjects with CLL are presented in Table 8.
Half-life values increased from 1.3 days after the first infusion to 15.8 days after the eighth infusion
and 13.9 days after the twelfth infusion.

**Table 8: Clearance and Half-life Values for ofatumumab after infusion in subjects with CLL**
**(Study Hx-CD20-402 and Study Hx-CD20-406)**

Ofatumumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides
and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes [Dempster, 2000]. The non-target
mediated clearance of ofatumumab is likely to be largely mediated by proteolysis.

- Dose proportionality and time dependencies

Mean AUC(0-∞) and Cmax after the first dose of ofatumumab, as well as mean AUC(0-∞) /dose and
mean Cmax/dose, plotted against dose, is presented in Figure 1. As seen in the figure, mean Cmax and
AUC **(** 0-∞) values for ofatumumab after the first dose seem to increase by dose more than expected in
most studies.

During repeated weekly infusions, ofatumumab AUC(0-∞) and Cmax values increased more than the
expected accumulation based on first infusion data, as also described under ‘Absorption’ above.

- Special populations

No studies specifically addressing pharmacokinetics in special populations were submitted. However,
pharmacokinetic differences in special populations were explored in the population pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic analysis and in the cross-study analysis of ofatumumab pharmacokinetics based on
data from studies 001, 402, 403 Part A and B and 406. In these analyses, the effect of body measures
(weight, body surface area) on pharmacokinetic parameters was modest (data not shown).
Age was not found to be a significant factor on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in a cross-study
population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients ranging in age from 21 to 86 years of age.
Gender had a modest effect (14-25%) on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in a cross-study analysis, with
higher C max and AUC values observed in female patients (41% of the patients in this analysis were
male and 59% were female); these effects are not considered clinically relevant, and no dose
adjustment is recommended.
Baseline calculated creatinine clearance was not found to be a clinically significant factor on
ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in a cross-study population analysis in patients with calculated
creatinine clearance values ranging from 33 to 287 ml/min. No dose adjustment is recommended for
mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min). There are no pharmacokinetic
data in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).
The potential influence of race was not assessed.
No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment. IgG1 molecules such as
ofatumumab are catabolised by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes, which are not restricted to hepatic
tissue; therefore, changes in hepatic function are unlikely to have any effect on the elimination of
ofatumumab.

- Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).

- Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

No studies were submitted.

**Pharmacodynamics**

- Mechanism of action

No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of ofatumumab action were submitted.

- Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Primary and secondary pharmacology parameters were measured in the course of the
efficacy/safety/PK studies which are summarised in Table 7. In the following, results from the pivotal
CLL study (Hx-CD20-406) are described, but references are also made to studies, 001, 402, 403A and
403B.
CD19+ B-cell counts were determined before, during, and after ofatumumab therapy to assess B-cell
depletion. The B-cell surface antigen CD19 was used as a marker for CD20, because the two antigens
have a similar expression profile on B cells and the presence of an anti-CD20 antibody binding to
CD20+ cells can interfere with the flow cytometric measurement of CD20+ cells.
There was a rapid and sustained depletion of CD20+ B cells after the first ofatumumab infusion,
leaving a reduced number of CD20+ cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions
(see Figure 2). In subjects with refractory CLL in Study Hx-CD20-406, the median decrease in B-cell
counts was 23% after the first infusion (300 mg) and 92% after the eighth infusion (2000 mg).
Peripheral B-cell counts remained low throughout therapy in most subjects and gradually increased
after the end of ofatumumab therapy, with the median decrease in B-cell counts remaining 68% below
baseline three months after the last infusion.

In general, serum IgG and IgA concentrations were stable during the studies, and serum IgM
concentrations declined, consistent with long-term B-cell depletion; in Study Hx-CD20-406 (CLL),
there appeared to be a modest decrease in mean IgG concentrations from baseline to Week 16. No
clinically significant changes in serum complement levels, T-cell counts, or NK-cell counts were
observed in the studies (data not shown).
There did not appear to be a relationship between ofatumumab dose and the incidence of infection
across the studies. In the placebo-controlled studies of ofatumumab in subjects with RA (Study 403
Part A and Part B), similar infection rates were observed in placebo subjects and in subjects receiving
ofatumumab at all three active dose levels. In subjects with CLL, no relationship was seen between
ofatumumab pharmacokinetics and occurrence of infections in study 402. In study 406 (CLL) longer
time to first major infection (defined as infections requiring at least 48 h hospitalization that occurred
during or within four weeks of completing treatment) was correlated with higher AUC(0-∞) and Cmin
values at the eighth infusion (data not shown).
Anti-ofatumumab antibodies were detected in only two samples out of the 274 subjects who received
ofatumumab in studies 001, 402, 403 Part A and B. However, conclusions regarding these results are
limited because the assay used to measure anti-ofatumumab antibodies was not capable of detecting
antibodies to all ofatumumab domains (F(ab’)2 binding antibody clinical assay). An assay which can
detect antibodies to any epitope on ofatumumab was subsequently developed and is being used to test
for anti-ofatumumab antibodies in ongoing study 406. In the 46 subjects who received at least eight
infusions and for whom data have been generated at ofatumumab concentrations <500 ng/ml (33 of
whom received all twelve infusions), there have been no positive samples (see SPC section 5.1). The

Page 26 of 63


-----

positive result in the subject in study 403 Part B was not confirmed using the whole ofatumumab
binding antibody clinical assay.
In study 402 (CLL), statistically significant associations were seen between objective response and
ofatumumab exposure after the fourth infusion (241% higher AUC, 43% higher Cmax, and 94%
higher Cmin values in subjects who responded compared to those who did not respond); higher AUC
values were associated with longer duration of response, delayed time to progression, and delayed
time to next anti-CLL therapy (data not shown). In study 406 (CLL), ofatumumab exposure was
higher at the eighth infusion (last weekly infusion) in subjects who responded (37% higher AUC, 23%
higher Cmax, and 91% higher Cmin values) than in subjects who did not respond, as assessed by
objective response from screening to Week 24; however, there was substantial overlap in exposure
values between subjects who responded and who did not respond. No differences in exposure were
seen at the twelfth infusion (last monthly infusion) between subjects who responded and subjects who
did not respond. Longer progression-free survival was associated with higher exposure (AUC, Cmax,
and Cmin values) at both the eighth and twelfth infusions (data not shown). Finally, there was little
apparent relationship between differences in ofatumumab exposure and clinical response in study 001
(FL) or study 403 Part A (RA). In study 403 Part B (RA), subjects who responded at Week 24 had
higher ofatumumab exposures (data not shown).

**Discussion on clinical pharmacological aspects**

As also mentioned in the discussion of non-clinical aspects, several concerns were raised concerning
the design and validation of the ELISA used to measure ofatumumab and the two ELISA methods
used to detect and quantify anti-ofatumumab antibodies. These concerns have not been fully resolved
by the applicant’s responses. Anti-ofatumumab antibodies in ongoing and future studies should solely
be monitored with the so called whole ofatumumab binding assay that seems capable of giving a more
correct picture of the production of antibodies when patients are administered ofatumumab.

Ofatumumab is eliminated in two ways: a target-independent route like other IgG molecules and a
target-mediated route which is related to binding to B cells. There was a rapid and sustained depletion
of CD20 [+] B cells after the first ofatumumab infusion, leaving a reduced number of CD20 [+] cells
available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions. As a result, ofatumumab clearance values
were lower and t ½ values were significantly larger after later infusions than after the initial infusion;
during repeated weekly infusions, ofatumumab AUC and C max values increased more than the
expected accumulation based on first infusion data.

No significant effect of impaired renal function, gender, age, and body measures (height, weight, body
surface area) on pharmacokinetic parameters was found. The potential influence of impaired hepatic
function and race was not assessed. Missing pharmacokinetic information in children and adolescents,
in severe renal impairment and in hepatic impairment is reflected in the SPC.

No drug interaction studies were submitted. As stated in the EMEA ‘Guideline on the clinical
investigation of the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins” (EMEA/CHMP/89249/2004):
‘Interaction studies should be considered (…) when suppression of the immunological system is
likely.’ An example of the latter is methotrexate, which significantly decreases the clearance of coadministered antibodies.’ The potential interaction with methotrexate will be investigated by the
Applicant in ongoing clinical studies.

CD19+ B-cell counts were used to assess B-cell depletion, the B-cell surface antigen CD19 being
considered as a marker for CD20. In the dose-finding study in patients with CLL (Hx-CD20-402),
there were only three patients in each of the two lower dose groups, thus the evidence supporting the
selected dose of the applied posology seems weak.

There was a significant drop in the IgM concentrations and a slight decrease in IgG concentrations
after initiation of ofatumumab therapy. However, the changes did not result in increased risk of
infections. The changes observed therefore do not give rise to immediate concern. However, these
findings and plans to monitor this potential side effect prospectively have been included in the risk
management plan.

Page 27 of 63


-----

The overall immunogenicity risk assessment for ofatumumab seems to be low. However, conclusions
regarding these results are limited because the assay used to measure anti-ofatumumab antibodies in
most studies was restricted to detection of antibodies of just one isotype (IgG1) and was not capable of
detecting antibodies to CH2 and CH3 domains. Immunogenicity data from clinical trials are described
in section 5.1 of the SPC. Immunogenicity is also listed as an identified risk in the Risk Management
Plan and actions to monitor the risk of treatment failure and risk of adverse reactions (e.g. anaphylactic
reactions) based on immunogenicity are described.

The relationship between plasma ofatumumab concentration and pharmacodynamic effect is complex
and its interpretation is not straightforward. Higher exposures may result in more tumour reduction;
however, lower or reduced tumour burden will result in reduced clearance and therefore higher

exposures.

**Clinical efficacy**

The primary evidence of the efficacy of ofatumumab is provided by the results of the interim analysis
of the ongoing pivotal study Hx-CD20-406. In addition, efficacy results from one completed
supportive study, Hx-CD20-402 are provided. The number of subjects treated in these studies is
summarized in the table below.

**Table 9: Summary of ofatumumab efficacy studies**

- Dose response study

Thirty-three subjects were enrolled into the Hx-CD20-402 dose-escalation study. Patients received 4
weekly infusions of ofatumumab:
Group A (n=3) received a first infusion of 100 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 500 mg
Group B (n=3) received a first infusion of 300 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 1000 mg
Group C (n=27) received a first infusion of 500 mg, and 3 subsequent infusions of 2000 mg.
The absolute doses applied in the current study were selected based on previous studies with rituximab
in FL and CLL, and on previous experience with ofatumumab in FL patients. One subject in Group C
was withdrawn from treatment after the first infusion due to an SAE of cytolytic hepatitis (elevation of
transaminases, maximal CTC Grade 3), considered related to study medication. Subjects had a

median age of 61 years, ranging from 27 to 82 years, and 42% of subjects were female. All subjects
were Caucasian. Most subjects were in the low or intermediate risk stage of their disease with Rai
Stage I or II (39% and 45%), or Binet Stage A or B (21% and 67%), respectively. No subjects in
Group A or Group B had constitutional symptoms. In Group C, 6% of subjects experienced extreme
fatigue and 15% experienced night sweats. The median number of prior CLL therapies was 4 in
Group A, 3 in Group B, and 2 in Group C.

Rapid, efficient, and sustained depletion of malignant and normal B cells was observed in all subjects
in Group C during the study period. The median time to progression in Group C was 4.4 months in
the full analysis population and 5.3 months in the subgroup of responders. The duration of response
was 4.4 months, and the time to next CLL therapy was 12.1 months.
Based on the results of this study a dose of 2000 mg was chosen for the pivotal study. Higher doses of
ofatumumab were not tested in this or any subsequent clinical study nor were any other phase I/II
studies submitted in support of the choice of dose as well as the frequency and duration of treatment
(see also section on supportive studies).

- Main study

Hx-CD20-406

This is an ongoing, single arm, open-label, multicentre (41 sites in 10 countries) study of ofatumumab
in subjects with B-CLL who are either refractory to both fludarabine and alemtuzumab, or who are
refractory to fludarabine and were considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab treatment due to bulky
lymphadenopathy. Single agent ofatumumab was administered as 8 weekly infusions followed by 4
monthly infusions over 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was response rate over a 24 week period.

M ETHODS

*Study Participants*
Adult subjects were eligible for participation if they had active CLL and were refractory to prior
therapy defined as a minimum of 2 cycles of fludarabine and at least 12 administrations of
alemtuzumab (double refractory, DR). Subjects were also eligible if they were refractory to prior
therapy defined as a minimum of 2 cycles of fludarabine and were considered inappropriate candidates
for alemtuzumab treatment due to the presence of bulky lymphadenopathy, defined as lymph node size
of >5 cm (bulky fludarabine refractory, BFR).
Main inclusion criteria were: Tumour cell phenotype consistent with B-CLL (CD5+CD20+CD23+),
patients with active B-CLL and with an indication for treatment defined as presenting one of the
conditions defined by the NCIWG criteria (evidence of progressive marrow failure, massive or
progressive splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, progressive lymphocytosis, weight loss/fever/night
sweats), refractory to one fludarabine-containing treatment regimen (failure to achieve at least PR or
disease progression while on treatment or disease progression in responders within 6 months of
treatment), failing at least one alemtuzumab-containing treatment regimen defined as either refractory
to one alemtuzumab-containing treatment regimen (as above) or considered inappropriate for
treatment with alemtuzumab due to lymphadenopathy with at least one lymph node >5 cm, ECOG
Performance Status of 0-2, life expectancy of at least 6 months.

Page 29 of 63


-----

Main exclusion criteria included various concomitant or prior therapies, other malignancies or
transformation of B-CLL to more aggressive malignancies, CNS involvement of B-CLL, other
significant comorbidities, poor performance status or short life expectancy.
The trial population included 3 populations established by Independent Review Committee (IRC)
review, which were analyzed separately: patients refractory to both fludarabine treatment and
alemtuzumab treatment (DR group), patients refractory to fludarabine treatment and were considered
inappropriate to alemtuzumab treatment due to bulky lymphadenopathy (BFR group), other, i.e.
patients who were intolerant/ineligible to fludarabine treatment and/or intolerant to alemtuzumab
treatment and who were not included in either of the 2 groups above. Patients who fulfilled the
definition of both double refractory and bulky fludarabine refractory were assigned to the DR group.

*Treatments*
The intended treatment consisted of 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab (first dose: 300 mg; second –
eighth dose: 2000 mg) followed by 4 monthly infusions of ofatumumab (ninth – 12th dose: 2000 mg).
The first monthly infusion was administered 5 weeks after the last weekly infusion and the following 3
monthly infusions were administered every 4 weeks. Thus, the first dose was administered at Week 0
(Visit 2) and the last dose was administered at Week 24 (Visit 14). The trial design is shown in Figure
3 below.

**Figure 3: Ofatumumab treatment schedule, study Hx-CD20-406**

*Objectives*
The primary objective of the pivotal trial was to evaluate the efficacy of ofatumumab in patients with
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who had failed fludarabine and alemtuzumab. Secondary
objectives were to determine the safety of ofatumumab, the host immune response to ofatumumab and
the pharmacokinetic profile of ofatumumab.

*Outcomes/endpoints*
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was response rate (RR) measured over a 24 week period
from the start of treatment, as determined by the IRC. Clinical assessments were done by investigators,
but response evaluations and classification of patients into DR, BFR and Other (the Other group did
not meet either the DR or BFR classification criteria) were done centrally by an IRC based on
evaluations of CRF data on lymph nodes and organomegaly (physical examination), relevant

laboratory data, constitutional symptoms, and medical history. In case of a possible CR, a CT scan and
a bone marrow examination were to be performed 8 weeks after a patient fulfilled the NCIWG 1996
guidelines requirements of a CR for the first time. CT scans were required only for the documentation
of suspected CR, otherwise, CT scans were not required nor done to confirm PR. Subjects not meeting
the criteria for CR, PR or PD were considered to have Stable Disease (SD). Transformation to a more
aggressive histology, including Richter’s syndrome or prolymphocytic leukaemia with >55%
prolymphocytes, was considered progressive disease.
Subjects were classified as responders or non-responders as follows: complete remission (CR),
nodular partial remission (nPR), and partial remission (PR) were classified as responders, while stable
disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) were classified as non-responders. Responses were
required to be maintained for at least two months (56 days). The definitions of each response category
are shown in Table 11.

**Table 11: Response criteria, NCIWG 1996 [Cheson, 1996]**

The secondary efficacy endpoints included: duration of response, progression-free survival, time to
next CLL therapy, overall survival, reduction in tumour size, CD5+CD19+, CD5+CD20+ in
peripheral blood, and expressions of CD19, CD20, CD55, and CD59 on CD45+CD5+ cells, progress
of constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, fever and extreme fatigue), resolution of
lymphadenopathy and organomegaly, improvement in ECOG Performance Status, haemoglobin,
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and number of blood transfusions. Another secondary endpoint
was evaluation of the prognostic value of fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) parameters, CD38+,
VH mutational status, Fc receptor polymorphisms,  2 microglobulin, thymidine kinase, circulating
CD20 and antigen density. At the time of the interim analysis, these results were not reported.

*Sample size*
Based on advice from clinical experts, it was estimated that the objective response rate on best
supportive care in these patient populations was 15% and that an objective response rate of 30% on
ofatumumab would be a clinically important improvement. Assuming that the response rate was 30%,
the probability that the two-sided 99% confidence interval (CI) would exclude a response rate of 15%
was 63%, based on data from 66 patients (primary endpoint interim analysis) and 92% based on data
from 100 patients (primary endpoint analysis). This applied equally for both the double refractory and

Page 31 of 63


-----

the bulky fludarabine refractory groups. A primary endpoint interim analysis was instituted at the
initial estimated cohort of 66 patients, which was the minimum number of patients that would enable a
reasonable power to test the null hypothesis.
The objective response rate with salvage chemotherapy is 20-25%, and 0% with monoclonal
antibodies [Tam, 2007], thus observing a 30% overall response rate that excludes a 15% overall
response rate at the 1% significance level indicates meaningful efficacy in this refractory population.

*Randomisation*
No randomisation was performed as this is an open-label trial.

*Blinding (masking)*
The pivotal study was a one-arm study with no control arm and blinding was not attempted.

*Statistical methods*
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients who had been exposed to trial drug irrespective of
their compliance to the planned course of treatment. This was the primary analysis population used for
evaluation of all endpoints and all 3 population subgroups. The per protocol (PP) analysis population
included patients who had not deviated from the protocol in such a manner that the assessment of
efficacy endpoints could be biased. Exclusions from the PP set were also considered on visit level, i.e.
a patient could be included in the PP population but the data from a certain visit excluded.
Standard statistical analyses for each of the trial endpoints were used.
The patients still on trial at week 12 (landmark time) were separated into 2 response categories
according to whether they responded before that time. An analysis was performed (landmark analysis)
for which probability estimates and statistical tests were conditional on the response status of patients
at the landmark time. The null hypothesis that ‘survival from landmark does not depend on response
status at landmark’ versus the alternative that ‘subsequent survival does depend on land-mark response
status’ was tested using the two-sided logrank test.

At the time that the primary efficacy endpoint data from the estimated 66 DR subjects were available,
this triggered the pre-defined interim analysis of the IRC assessed response rates. The 66 DR subject
trigger was based upon sponsor assessment of eligibility information and status. The IRC confirmed
eligibility of 59 subjects in the DR group for this interim analysis, and ultimately reallocated 7
subjects from the DR to the BFR group. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) reviewed
the IRC assessed response rate analysis. In addition, sponsor generated data queries resulted in two
reconsensus meetings of the IRC members to verify the final interim analysis response rates. The IRC
was only instructed to downgrade responses to non-responses during this process, and non-responders
were not re-evaluated.

R ESULTS

*Participant flow*
Only patients with potential of having primary endpoint data at cut-off were evaluated (i.e. patients
with planned or completed Visit 2 ). This included 198 screened patients of whom 154 were allocated
and exposed to ofatumumab. Patient assignment based on the IRC assessment included 59 exposed
DR patients, 79 exposed BFR patients, and 16 exposed CLL patients assigned as Other. The patient
disposition is presented in Figure 4.

d. Due to bone marrow transplant; started new treatment; no response; allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
e. Seven patients died during extended follow-up due to SAEs with onset during treatment or follow-up phase.
f. Due to palliative care only; lost to follow-up.

*Recruitment*
The trial was initiated 13-Jun-2006 (first informed consent signed) and is still ongoing. The cut-off
date for this protocol specified interim analysis was 19-May-2008.

*Conduct of the study*
The trial protocol underwent 5 amendments which primarily resulted in changes to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria and the number of subjects planned. A summary of the major changes is given in
the following table.

**Table 12: Major amendments to the protocol**

|Amendment number and date|Key changes in the amendment|
|---|---|
|Amendment 1 27 February 2006|Updates on inclusion and exclusion criteria including:  Criteria for definition of refractoriness to alemtuzumab  Bulky lymphadenopathy (>5 cm lymph nodes) added as definition of ineligibility for alemtuzumab therapy No subjects were enrolled prior to the implementation of this amendment.|
|Amendment 2 26 September 2006|Clarification of primary study objective to include only efficacy. Updates on inclusion and exclusion criteria including:  Removal of inclusion criteria for intolerance and ineligibility to fludarabine therapy  Specification of minimum number of treatment cycles to define refractoriness to prior d fludarabine and alemtuzumab Minimum Residual Disease (MRD) analysis was added to the secondary endpoints.|
|Amendment 3 16 April 2007|e s Definition of trial population to include two main groups to be analyzed separately: i  Subjects refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab r  Subjects refractory to fludarabine and considered inappropriate for alemtuzumab due o to bulky lymphadenopathy h The assumptions for the sample size calculations were updated, the maximum number of t u subjects to be enrolled in the trial was increased from 100 to 150 (target of 66 per group) and the Data Monitoring Committee stopping rules based on critical AEs were updated a accordingly. r Clarification of response evaluations: e  Removal of the requirements of radiographic techniques from the CR definition g  Addition of lymphocyte requirements to the CR definition  Lymphadenopathy was defined as lymph nodes with the largest diameter ≥1.0 cm|
|Amendment 4 31 October 2007|n o Increase in planned number of subjects to be enrolled from 66 subjects to 100 subjects in each l subject group, to a maximum of approximately 225 subjects. Update to statistical analysis plan including testing for the primary endpoint to exclude a 15% o response rate. n Inclusion of interim analysis comprising superiority and futility analysis when primary t endpoint data is available from 66 subjects in double-refractory group. Three secondary c endpoints (early death, major infections and infections requiring hospitalization and IV antibiotics) were added.|
|Amendment 5 15 July 2008|u d Administrative changes in accordance with transfer of trial sponsorship from Genmab to GSK as of 28 April 2008|


Amendments 2 and 3 defined the subject eligibility definition consistent with the DR and BFR subject
populations and the study would no longer enrol subjects who had demonstrated lack of tolerability to
fludarabine and alemtuzumab. As a result, 16 subjects who were intolerant/ineligible to fludarabine or
intolerant to alemtuzumab and enrolled prior to Amendment 2 were included in the interim analysis,
and are described and analyzed separately as “Other”.

monoclonal antibodies (60%). Some subjects have been treated with investigational agents as well.
The majority of subjects in all groups also received prior treatment with rituximab, either as
monotherapy or as part of combination therapy.

The majority of subjects (57%) had prior treatment with one or more rituximab containing regimen.
The most common regimen was FCR, particularly in the DR group.

*Numbers analysed*
Efficacy results for Study Hx-CD20-406 are presented for the DR, BFR and combined DR+BFR
subjects (combined group), since these represent the fludarabine-refractory CLL population. The FAS
population was the analysis population used throughout the presentation of results. Seven patients
were screened and allocated to treatment, but were not treated with ofatumumab and they were
therefore not included in the FAS. Among these, 4 patients were ineligible according to selection
criteria at Visit 2 and 1 patient had progression of disease related symptoms prior to the first infusion.
These 5 patients were considered as screening failures. Furthermore, prior to any ofatumumab
exposure, one patient withdrew consent and one patient withdrawn due to deep vein thrombosis. The
total number of patients analysed is thus 138, with 59 in the DR group and 79 in the BFR group. There
were no major protocol deviations requiring exclusion of patients from the FAS or the PP population.

*Outcomes and estimation*

Per protocol, investigators were instructed to determine an assessment of response at each clinical
evaluation visit. However, investigators were not instructed to determine an overall response for each
individual subject.  As a result, there was no overall response assessment for each subject determined
by the investigator. An algorithm was applied to the individual investigator assessment of response at
each visit to derive an overall response for each subject, from which an Investigator Assessment
response rate was calculated. A summary of the IRC assessment, Investigator assessment and the
Sponsor assessment of response rate is provided in the following table.

**Table 17: Summary of Response Rates as Assessed by IRC, Investigator and Sponsor**

An expert panel of IRC members applied the protocol specified method of response determination to
assure an independent, consistent and medically appropriate application of this composite measure of
response in CLL. Differences in the response rate assessment according to the three measures largely
reflected differences in clinical assessment of transient changes that an expert would not interpret as
evidence of disease progression. The algorithmic approach by the sponsor did not account for this,
and so represented the most stringent test of the response rate. Nevertheless, the concordance rates
between assessments by the IRC and Sponsor were 80% for the DR group and 84% for the BFR
group. Investigators evaluated subjects for response at each visit and may not have referred to
baseline measurements when determining response. In contrast, the IRC was provided all relevant
data at the same time, including baseline measurements, for a more comprehensive assessment of
overall response. This may explain the differences between investigator response rates and IRC
response rates. This sensitivity analysis provided a range of possible response rate interpretations.

**Secondary Efficacy Endpoints**

Reduction in Lymph Node SPD. Lymph node size, as measured by physical exam and reported as the
sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) was assessed from baseline until Month 24. Within 4
weeks of ofatumumab treatment, median lymph node SPD decreased in the combined group from 36.9
cm [2] to 17.0 cm [2], from 26.3 cm [2] to 5.0 cm [2] in the DR group, and from 51.0 cm [2] to 23.0 cm [2] in the BFR
group. This corresponds to an overall 60% decrease in median SPD over 4 weeks (DR: 71%, BFR:

51%). At Week 8, the overall median decrease in SPD versus baseline was 69% (DR: 76%, BFR:
63%). Reductions in median lymph node SPD continued during the treatment period. At Week 24,
the reduction in median SPD versus baseline in the combined group was 81% (DR: 78%, BFR 83%).

Reduction in Lymphocyte Count. Lymphocyte counts were assessed from baseline to Week 24.
Within 1 week of initiation of ofatumumab treatment, the combined group median lymphocyte count
was decreased from 18.1x10 [9] cells/L at baseline to 10.6x10 [9] cells/L, with a reduction in the DR group
from 14.7x10 [9] cells/L to 8.5x10 [9] cells/L, and from 28.5x10 [9] cells/L to 11.4x10 [9] cells/L in the BFR
group. This corresponds to a 41% combined median reduction (DR: 42%, BFR: 60%). By Week 4,
the combined group median lymphocyte count was 3.1x10 [9] cells/L, with a reduction in the DR group
to 3.0x10 [9 ] cells/L, and 3.2x10 [9 ] cells/L in the BFR group, an 83% combined group median reduction
compared to baseline (DR: 81%, BFR: 89%).

Malignant B cells in peripheral blood. Malignant B cells are CD45+CD5+CD19+ or
CD45+CD5+CD20+ cells. Ofatumumab binds to CD20 and could interfere with the
CD45+CD5+CD20+ assay, therefore, the CD45+CD5+CD19+ assay was also used.
Immunophenotyping was done at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. Malignant B cells showed
changes similar to those of total lymphocytes (data not shown).

Duration of response. Duration of response was defined as the time from initial response to disease
progression or death, and was defined only for subjects who responded (CR, nPR or PR) during the 24
week period from start of treatment. A sensitivity analysis of duration of response was also
performed, which defined the duration of response as the time from initial response until progression
reported by local investigator, or AE, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason including disease
progression, new CLL treatment, treatment toxicity and death. The median time to onset of response,
median duration of response, median duration of response sensitivity analysis, and the median
duration of response after last infusion are shown in the following table.

combined.

**Figure 5: Duration of response**

The median duration of response was 7.1 months in the DR group, and 5.6 months in the BFR and
combined groups), indicating that the median duration of response was nearly as long as the intended
treatment duration with ofatumumab (24 weeks or 6 months).

Progression - free survival. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from baseline
(allocation to treatment) until progression of CLL or death. The progression events were defined in
the protocol, and progression dates were verified by the IRC. PFS is presented in the table below for
the 102 subjects (DR: 40, BFR: 62) with an observed progression of CLL or death.

**Table 19: Summary of Progression** **-** **Free Survival, Study Hx** **-** **CD20** **-** **406**

Time to next CLL treatment. Time to next CLL treatment was defined as the time from baseline
(allocation of treatment) to the time of first administration of the next CLL treatment other than
ofatumumab. A total of 31 DR (53%) and 51 BFR subjects (65%) with disease progression during the
study period received subsequent CLL therapy, see table below:

ofatumumab in this trial. A total of 46 different treatment combinations were used as new CLL
therapy that included chemotherapy, immunotherapy, chemo-immunotherapy, radiotherapy, allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation and leukapheresis.

Overall Survival. At the time of the interim analysis, 27 DR and 31 BFR subjects (58 combined group)
had died. The median overall survival was similar across groups.

**Table 21: Summary of Overall Survival**

Constitutional symptoms. Constitutional symptoms were reported by subjects and results captured by
investigators every 4 weeks during the treatment period (Week 0 to Week 24) and through the followup period (Week 28 to Month 24) as part of assessment of response. More than three-quarters of
subjects with baseline constitutional symptoms experienced complete resolution of all symptoms at
some point during the study (79%, 61/77). All but one of these subjects experienced complete
resolution during the treatment period. Nearly all responders with baseline constitutional symptoms
experienced complete resolution (93%, 40/43). In addition, all subjects without constitutional
symptoms at baseline remained symptom-free during the study.

Resolution of lymphadenopathy. Complete resolution of lymphadenopathy was defined as the
presence of palpable lymph nodes  1 cm at baseline followed by palpable lymph nodes of normal size
(<1 cm) at a later time. One-fifth of the combined group subjects with baseline lymphadenopathy had
complete resolution at some point during the study (20%, 25/128); the majority had some persistent
lymphadenopathy during study treatment. There were no subjects without baseline lymphadenopathy
that developed new lymphadenopathy during the study.

Resolution of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Complete resolution was defined as the presence of an
enlarged palpable spleen or liver at baseline followed by absence of splenomegaly post-baseline. More
than half of subjects in the combined group experienced complete resolution of splenomegaly some
time during the study (60%, 42/70), and all occurred during the treatment period. Of these, 34
subjects experienced complete resolution of splenomegaly during response. More than two-thirds of
subjects in the combined group experienced complete resolution of hepatomegaly some time during
the study (71%, 24/34), and all occurred during the treatment period. Of these, 17 subjects
experienced complete resolution of hepatomegaly during response. The absence of organomegaly was
maintained in the majority of subjects without baseline organomegaly, two subjects had worsening of
splenomegaly and one subject had worsening of hepatomegaly as best response during the study
period.

Improvement in ECOG performance status. Nearly half of subjects with the opportunity to improve in
ECOG performance status from baseline did improve (48%, 41/86), with the improvement occurring
during the treatment period in 39 of 41 subjects. Most improvements in responders occurred during
the time of response to ofatumumab (64%, 27/42). More than one-third of subjects with the
opportunity to improve maintained their ECOG performance status (41%, 35/86), and very few
subjects declined (5%, 4/86). Nearly all subjects with an ECOG performance status of 0 did not
worsen during the study period (96%, 50/52).

Improvement in haemoglobin values. Haemoglobin values increased steadily from baseline through
the treatment period and into the follow-up period, as shown in the following Figure 6.

Improvement in platelet counts. Almost half of subjects with low platelets at baseline had documented
improvement in platelet levels at some time during the study (46%, 46/100), with most of the
improvements occurring during the treatment period. Nearly all of the subjects with normal or high
platelet levels at baseline maintained their levels during the study (97%, 36/37). Only one subject had
a worsening of a normal platelet level during the study.

Improvement in neutropenia. Median neutrophil counts remained above the lower limit of normal
from baseline through the treatment period and into the follow-up period, as shown in the following
Figure 7.

*Ancillary analyses*
The Applicant submitted a number of ancillary analyses which indicated that the effect of ofatumumab
was independent of prior cyclophosphamide, rituximab and FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and
rituximab) treatment and independent of the number of prior CLL therapies employed (data not
shown).

- Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

No analyses across trials were submitted.

- Clinical studies in special populations

Analyses in special populations of the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 indicated that there was no
difference in response to ofatumumab due to age, sex and geopraphic region. As very few patients
were non-Caucasian, no race differences could not be assessed. Baseline disease characteristics,
including bone marrow involvement and number and size of enlarged lymph nodes were not found to
affect the response to ofatumumab. With regard to chromosomal abnormalities, 17q deletion, 11q
deletion and 12q trisomy were not found to affect the response to ofatumumab, as opposed to 13q
deletion, which seemed to favour the response.
Over-expression of CD38+ is an adverse prognostic marker for CLL. Subjects were assessed at
baseline for CD38 expression levels. Subjects were considered CD38+ if the percentage of CD38+
among CD5+CD19+ cells was greater than 20% as compared to isotope controls. CD38+ status
appeared to be predictive of response in DR subjects, but not in BFR subjects. DR subjects who were
CD38+ had a response rate of 41%, versus 80% in subjects who were CD38- (p=0.0036).
Subjects were assessed at baseline for Fc receptor polymorphisms, and were classified by one of three
phenotypes of Fc  IIa (H/A, A/A, H/H), and by one of three phenotypes of Fc  IIIa (V/P, P/P, V/V).
The response rates were similar for all phenotypes within both the DR and BFR groups, suggesting
that Fc receptor polymorphisms are not predictive of response to ofatumumab.

- Supportive study

The only study in CLL apart from the pivotal Hx-CD20-406 study was the dose-finding Hx-CD20-402
study. A juxtaposition to the pivotal study Hx-CD20-402 is presented in the following table.

- Discussion on clinical efficacy

The CHMP considered that the uncontrolled design of the pivotal trial Hx-CD20-406 was of major
concern. Although ofatumumab showed activity in CLL, the lack of control group made it impossible
to conclusively assess the efficacy of ofatumumab relative to other treatments in subjects with double
refractory or fludarabine refractory-bulky lymphadnopathy CLL. The Applicant’s view that it was not
feasible to conduct a comparative study was questioned and the use of a historical comparison was not
considered adequate. Similarly, the comparison of time-dependent endpoints in responding patients vs
non-responders (landmark analysis) was questioned, as response could simply be a marker for patients
with pretreatment characteristics that favour longer survival. Although no single therapy stands out as
the treatment of choice for refractory patients, a comparison against “physician’s choice” or standard
of care was felt to have been an option. Mono- or combination therapies of alkylators, antimetabolites
or monoclonal antibodies were proposed as potential comparators.

An Oncology Scientific Advisory Group (SAG-O) was convened to provide their clinical expert
opinion on these issues. The SAG was asked to discuss potential acceptable active comparators for a
confirmatory phase III trial in a comparable population to the one included in the pivotal phase II trial
(patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab or refractory to fludarabine and ineligible for
alemtuzumab due to bulky lymphadenopathy) also taking into account that 80% were deemed
refractory to alkylating agents and that a substantial number of patients had progressed on
chemotherapy with rituximab as add-on. They were also asked whether a comparison to physician’s
choice would be feasible. The SAG argued that it is important to distinguish two separate groups of
patients, namely patients whose disease is refractory to at least two regimen including fludarabine and
alemtuzumab (“double-refractory”), versus patients whose disease is refractory to fludarabine and
ineligible for alemtuzumab due to bulky lymphadenopathy (“bulky fludarabine refractory”). These two
groups differ significantly in terms of disease biology, number of therapies received, available
treatment options.

For double-refractory disease, the SAG agreed that it was unfortunate that no comparative data were
available, for example, to assess the effect of ofatumumab on overall survival, but also acknowledged
that choice of comparator was very problematic. In this group, particular after disease progression
after multiple regimens chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies, performance status is often poor
and there are no regimens with established efficacy and safety, according to scientific standards.
Although in practice salvage chemotherapy is attempted when possible, such regimens are associated
with significant toxicity including mortality. Therefore, their use as active controls could bias efficacy
comparisons in favour of the less toxic treatments, regardless of efficacy. Thus, the SAG agreed that

Page 43 of 63


-----

although theoretically possible, the choice of an active and safe control in double-refractory disease
was very difficult due to the lack of an established regimen. However, one SAG member disagreed
arguing that even in this population it is feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials against
physician best choice, and that in the absence of randomized trials the relative effects in terms of
efficacy and safety cannot be established.

The SAG agreed that the situation is different in “bulky fludarabine-refractory” disease, where patients
are less pre-treated and in a better condition to tolerate salvage therapies. In this second-line
indication, acceptable comparators including salvage chemotherapy or chemotherapy and rituximab
should be considered, although their activity is considered lower than for fludarabine-refractory
patients. Indeed a number of patients had received such 2nd line regimen including rituximab. The
SAG agreed that patients with “bulky fludarabine-refractory” disease that is refractory to at least two
regimens (at least one of which included fludarabine), are considered to be in a similar situation as that
of patients with “double-refractory” disease.

The SAG was also asked to discuss the acceptability and feasibility of a phase II trial with best
supportive care as comparator. The SAG agreed that if the performance status allows it, best
supportive care would not be an acceptable comparator due to the significant symptoms and rapid
worsening of the disease. In patients when the performance status is poor and supportive care is the
only available option, phase III trials would be difficult to conduct, due to the very poor prognosis and
the limited chances for new treatments to change the course of the disease.

As an answer to the question whether an unmet medical need existed for the population in question,
the SAG agreed that for patients with double-refractory disease there is clearly an unmet medical need.
Available regimens have not been established according to scientific standards and are associated with
significant toxicity including toxic deaths. The situation is different in “bulky fludarabine-refractory”
disease, where patients are less pre-treated and in a better condition to tolerate salvage therapies;
however following second line therapy no therapeutic option is available. Thus the unmet medical
need for patients with “bulky fludarabine-refractory” disease that is refractory to at least two regimens
(at least one of which included fludarabine), is similar to that of patients with “double-refractory”
disease.

Finally, in response to the question whether the apparently high response rate observed in the pivotal
trial is clinically relevant, the SAG agreed to the following: The population of patients whose disease
is refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab was adequately represented in the pivotal Study HxCD20-406. In this subgroup, the median number of prior therapies was 5, 93% of patients received
prior alkylating agents and 59% received prior rituximab. The SAG agreed that the ORR observed in
this population was high, the onset of the response was rapid and the duration of response was longlasting. The SAG agreed that it is reasonable to assume that this effect will lead to some improvement
in disease related symptoms and that this is expected to be of clinical relevance. The clinical
improvements may in principle allow further clinically relevant benefits, e.g., allowing further salvage
treatments (or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) in general not doable in such patients.

Indeed, in the pivotal trial responses were associated with clinical improvement in disease-related
symptoms and this would be of immediate clinical relevance to the patients. However, this is based on
exploratory analyses of a single-arm trial and firm conclusions cannot be drawn.

The SAG agreed that further studies should address the basis for stopping treatment after 24 weeks,
because treatment discontinuation was associated with loss of response.

The SAG agreed that drug refractoriness should be clearly defined in the prescribing information, in
line with the definition used in the pivotal study, namely, failure to achieve at least a partial response
with fludarabine or alemtuzumab treatment, or disease progression within 6 months of the last dose of
fludarabine or alemtuzumab.

The SAG agreed that similar considerations applied to patients with “bulky fludarabine-refractory”
disease that is refractory to at least two regimens (at least one of which included fludarabine). These

Page 44 of 63

patients were included in the study and similar response rates and durations were observed as for the
double-refractory subgroup.

**Clinical safety**

The safety database included subjects who were exposed to at least one dose of ofatumumab. The
studies contributing to the safety analysis are reported in Table 23. Because patients in other
indications received significantly lower doses of ofatumumab in the course of their treatment, as
detailed in Table 23, only CLL patients are considered in the following.

- Patient exposure

A total of 648 subjects were exposed to ofatumumab in 12 studies across oncology and non-oncology
indications as of the cut-off date for this submission, 20 June 2008. The number of patients in each
study and the doses of ofatumumab administered in these studies are summarised in the following
Table 23.

**Table 23: Overview of Subjects Contributing to the Safety Analysis of Ofatumumab**

1. In the blinded studies, subjects in the active arm received 700 mg ofatumumab.
2. Study Hx-CD20-406 (pivotal monotherapy CLL study) - subjects exposed to treatment up to 24 weeks
(ongoing study). An additional 31 subjects were enrolled but not included in the interim analysis because
primary endpoint data for interim analysis was not available at the time of the data cut-off. Only SAE data as
of the cut-off date of 20 June 2008 is included for these 31 subjects.
3. Study Hx-CD20-402 (monotherapy dose escalation study) – subjects exposed to treatment up to 3 weeks
(completed study).
4. Study Hx-CD20-407 - 14 subjects received 500 mg ofatumumab plus FC, and 14 subjects received 1000 mg
ofatumumab plus FC - subjects exposed for up to 20 weeks (ongoing study).
5. Study Hx-CD20-001 (completed study) – subjects exposed to treatment up to 3 weeks.
6. Study Hx-CD20-405 (ongoing single-arm study) was a double-blind, two-dose study prior to a protocol

of the study (parallel dose escalation), 58 subjects received 300 mg, 57 subjects received 700 mg, and 54
subjects received 1000 mg ofatumumab.
10. Study GEN410 (blinded ongoing study)- Subjects in the active arm received 700 mg ofatumumab in addition

14. One subject (402614) was allocated to 2000 mg dose group, but only received one infusion of 500 mg
(priming dose).

The safety of Arzerra in patients with relapsed or refactory CLL was evaluated in two open label
studies. In study Hx-CD20-406, 154 patients were enrolled to receive an initial dose of 300 mg
followed by 7 consecutive weekly infusions of 2000 mg, followed five weeks later with 4 consecutive
monthly infusions of 2000 mg. The second study (Hx-CD20-402) was a dose-finding study and
patients in three cohorts (3 patients, 3 patients, 27 patients) received a starting dose of 100 mg, 300 mg
or 500 mg, followed a week later with 3 consecutive weekly infusions of 500 mg, 1000 mg or
2000 mg of Arzerra, respectively. The adverse reactions reported are from final data from the initial
dose-range finding and a planned interim analysis of study Hx-CD20-406.
Most subjects in study 406 (90%, 139 subjects) received all 8 weekly infusions, 69% (107 subjects)
received at least 10 infusions and 55% (85 subjects) received all 12 infusions (completed 24 weeks of
treatment). In the supportive study 402, most subjects in the 2000 mg group received the intended 4
infusions (25/27).

- Adverse events

An overview of adverse events in the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 as of the cut-off date for the interim
analysis (19 May 2008) is given in Table 24.

**Table 24: Overview of AEs in Subjects in Study Hx** **-** **CD20** **-** **406 (Treatment or Follow** **-** **up)**

1. 5 additional subjects had disease progression listed as the AE that resulted in discontinuation.

In addition to infections and infusion reactions, common adverse events (experienced by ≥10%) were:
Pyrexia (31 subjects, 20%), cough (30 subjects, 19%), diarrhoea (28 subjects, 18%), pneumonia (25
subjects, 16%), neutropenia (25 subjects, 16%), anaemia (25 subjects, 16%), fatigue (23 subjects,
15%) and dyspnoea (22 subjects, 14%). Most of the adverse events were seen in subjects on treatment
(81%). Infusion reactions occurred with the greatest incidence (44%) on the first infusion day (300 mg
or 500 mg), decreased to 26% with the second infusion (2000 mg) and declined further during
subsequent infusions (2000 mg).
In the supportive study Hx-CD20-402, 27 (82%) patients reported 246 AEs which predominantly
(92%) were of CTC grade 1-2 intensity. A total of 23 of 33 (70%) subjects had infusion related events
(i.e. events with onset on an infusion day). Of the 138 infusion related events 84 (61%) were reported

on the day of the first infusion. Sixteen of the 33 (48%) subjects had infections. The most common
infections were of the respiratory tract (10 subjects, 30%). Eleven of the 33 subjects (33%) had
 Grade 3 AEs. Thrombocytopenia (3 subjects, 9%), neutropenia (2 subjects, 6%), and pyrexia (2
subjects, 6%) were the most common  Grade 3 AEs.
Adverse events considered related to treatment by the investigator (adverse drug reactions) in both
CLL studies (402 and 406) are shown in Table 25. A total of 21% of subjects in the study had an
adverse event in the Infections and infestations SOC that was considered related to treatment.
Symptoms that characterize infusion reactions were considered drug-related in 47% of the subjects.
Adverse drug reactions are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class and by frequency. Very
common (≥ 1/10); Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); Uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); Rare (≥ 1/10,000
to < 1/1,000); Very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within
each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Infections
Infections reported in the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 were of Grade 1 or 2 in severity in 91 of 154
patients (59%).
A total of 31 (20%) subjects had 39 Grade 3 infections (in 27 subjects, these events were also reported
as SAEs). In 8 subjects with Grade 3 infections, the events were considered drug-related by the
investigator (pneumonias: 4 subjects; septic complication: 1 subject, other infections: 3 subjects). Six
of these infections were also reported as SAEs.
Eight of 154 subjects (5%) had Grade 4 infections, all of which were also reported as SAEs. The
majority of these infections (6 events in 6 subjects) were respiratory tract infections, with pneumonias

being the most common events (4 subjects, 4 events). Grade 4 infections in 6 subjects were considered
drug-related (pneumonias: 3 subjects; septic complication: 1 subject, other infections: 2 subjects).
Grade 5 (fatal) infections occurred in 16 subjects (10%) during treatment or follow-up; 9 occurred
within 30 days of the last dose of ofatumumab, 5 occurred within 30 to 60 days after last dose of
ofatumumab, and 2 occurred beyond 60 days after the last dose of ofatumumab. During extended
follow-up, an additional 14 subjects (9%) died due to infection (6 pneumonia, 7 sepsis, 1 aspergillus
infection). Two of these 14 deaths occurred in close proximity (i.e., within 30 days) to last dose, one
being categorized as an early death (defined as occurring within 8 weeks of starting treatment). Both
deaths occurred after the start of new CLL therapy (one patient started on high dose steroids and died
38 days after the last dose, and the other started on high dose steroids and lenalidomide and died 32
days after the last dose.
A total of 40 (26% of 154) subjects had infections that required hospitalization and IV antibiotics.
A total of 24 of 154 subjects (16%) had 27 infections that were considered opportunistic based on
clinical practice. All but one serious opportunistic infection occurred in non-responders. The
opportunistic infections that were serious included herpes zoster, aspergilloma, fusarium infection,
pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, fungal pneumonia and PML.
Factors associated with higher frequency and/or increased severity of infection included advanced
stage of the disease, high number of prior treatments and baseline neutropenia (especially severe).
In the dose escalation supportive study Hx-CD20-402, 16 subjects (48%) had infections reported as
AEs. Respiratory tract infections were the most common events, occurring in 10 of 33 subjects (30%).
In contrast to the pivotal study, infections of the upper respiratory tract were more common (9
subjects, 27%) than lower respiratory tract infections (1 subject, 3%). The most common upper
respiratory infection was nasopharyngitis occurring in 5 subjects (15%). Other infections occurred in 7
subjects (21%). There were no cases of sepsis reported.
A total of 3 subjects had 4 infections that were considered to be related to study treatment: one subject
had herpes zoster and pustular rash, one subject had upper respiratory tract infection, and one had
varicella. Three subjects reported infectious SAEs: Grade 3 herpes zoster, Grade 3 pneumonia, and
Grade 2 event of sinusitis. Three subjects had Grade 5 (i.e., fatal) infections. One subject had ILD
during the main study period and 2 subjects had pneumonia after completion of the study.

Infusion reactions
In the pivotal study, 41% of subjects had infusion reaction AEs following the first infusion declining
to 6% for the last infusion. One subject stopped treatment due to an infusion reaction. The events were
usually mild (  Grade 2). Seven subjects had infusion reactions classified as SAEs. There were no
deaths due to infusion reactions. Anaphylactoid events included 5 patients with cytokine release
syndrome, all but one subject had cytokine release syndrome during their first infusion.

Predominant SAEs reported during extended follow-up, i.e., after treatment withdrawal or withdrawal
from follow-up, were infections (6 DR, 7 BFR, and 2 Other subjects) and disease progression/CLL (4
DR, 6 BFR, 0 Other subjects).
A total of 25 (16%) subjects had 39 SAEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to
ofatumumab (11 subjects in the DR group, 8 in the BFR group, 6 in the Other group).

Supportive CLL Study (Hx - CD20 - 402) and CLL Combination Stud y ( Hx- C D2 0 -407)
Nine of 33 subjects (27%) had 10 SAEs during study Hx-CD20-402; the majority were in the 2000 mg
group: neutropenia (2), haemolytic anaemia, carotid artery stenosis, angina pectoris, ILD, pneumonia,
herpes zoster, sinusitis and cytolytic hepatitis. Five SAEs were considered drug-related: herpes zoster,
2 events of neutropenia, ILD and cytolytic hepatitis.
For the combination therapy study Hx-CD20-407, 12 subjects (43%) had 23 SAEs. The most common
SAEs were neutropenia (5) and febrile neutropenia (3). Four of the subjects had drug-related SAEs:
rhabdomyolysis, neutropenia, fungal pneumonia and decreased neutrophil count.

Deaths
A summary of all deaths observed in all ofatumumab studies is presented in the following Table 27.

A total of 61 subjects (clinical cut-off 19 May 2008) died during the pivotal study Hx-CD20-406); 24
during treatment or follow-up and 37 during the extended follow-up (7 before and 30 after initiation of
new CLL treatment). Most subjects died >60 days after the last dose of ofatumumab (Table 16)
including 2 subjects who died >1 year after last dose of ofatumumab. In addition, four deaths (disease
progression, pulmonary oedema, cardiac arrest and bladder cancer) occurred after the clinical cut-off
date. Seven deaths occurred during the extended follow-up, with no specific diagnosis given as cause
of death. Six subjects died within 8 weeks after the start of treatment (i.e., early death): 1 due to
pneumonia (after initiation of new CLL therapy), 2 due to sepsis, 1 each due to fungal pneumonia,
fusarium infection and myocardial infarction. None of these early deaths were considered related to
treatment by the investigator.

Sixteen of the 24 deaths during treatment and follow-up were due to infections: 10 (17%) of 59 DR
subjects, 5 (6%) of 79 BFR subjects and 1 (6%) of 16 Other subjects. The most common infections
were septic complications (15 subjects) and pneumonia (10 subjects). Of all deaths in this study four
cases were considered related to treatment by the investigator: sepsis, pneumocystis jiroveci
pneumonia, pneumonia, PML.
The remaining eight deaths were caused by disease progression, including CLL transformation and
hemiparesis in 6 subjects and cardiac events in 2 subjects during treatment or follow-up.
In the supportive CLL study Hx-CD20-402, there were 3 deaths, one during treatment and 2 after
withdrawal from the study. One subject died of ILD 29 days after the last dose of ofatumumab; this
fatal SAE was considered drug-related. This subject had a 10-year history of CLL, had 4 prior
treatments for CLL, prior treatment for chronic hypogammaglobulinemia, and had several episodes of
pneumonia (interstitial pneumopathy) prior to entry into the study. The investigator considered the
event to be drug-related. Two subjects died after withdrawal from the study (pneumonia, disease
progression). These events were not considered related to treatment.
There have been no deaths in the CLL combination study (Hx-CD20-407) or the FL combination
study (Hx-CD20-409) as of the cut-off date of 14 April 2008. Seven deaths were reported in the FL
monotherapy studies (Hx-CD20-001, Hx-CD20-405), none of which were considered related to
treatment. Three deaths occurred on study and were caused by disease progression (2 cases, 63 days

and 6 months after last dose) and sepsis (37 days after last dose). Four cases occurred after withdrawal
from study and were caused by sepsis, disease progression (2) and peritonitis.

Immunogenicity
Subjects were tested for Human anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) at baseline, and at the indicated
times over the course of the individual studies. A positive result was defined as an 8-fold increase
over the baseline titre of HAHA.
There were no reports for the development of HAHA in any of the CLL studies. Of the 3 studies in
Folicular Lymphoma (FL), one patient in one study was scored HAHA positive (8-fold increase in
titre) in a single instance. In the Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) study, one patient had a positive result
(16-fold increase in titre) at a single instance, which was not confirmed using the whole ofatumumab
binding antibody clinical assay.

- Laboratory findings

Haematologic Assessments
A decrease in the median neutrophil count within the first few weeks of ofatumumab treatment was
evident. The neutrophil count in subjects with baseline neutropenia did not appear to worsen during
the treatment period. Neutropenia, including Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, was observed in subjects with
baseline neutropenia as well as in some subjects with a normal neutrophil count at baseline. Decrease
in the neutrophil count (including AEs with the preferred terms neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis,
neutrophil count decreased, and febrile neutropenia) has been associated with anti-CD20 antibody
therapy and it was reported in the pivotal study in 19% of subjects in at least one instance.
Anaemia was observed as an AE in 19% of subjects although many had anaemia at baseline.
However, no decrease in median hemoglobin values and no clinically meaningful shifts to worse CTC
grades were observed in the study population. On the contrary, there was evidence for an increase in
median haemoglobin values during the 52 week observation period.
Thrombocytopenia was observed as an AE in 2 (1%) subjects and both were thrombocytopenic at
baseline. However, no decrease in median platelet count and no clinically meaningful shifts to worse
CTC grades were observed in the study population. On the contrary, there was evidence for an
increase in median platelet counts during the 52 week observation period.

Biochemistry Assessments
Forty percent (40%) of patients had elevated values for uric acid of at least Grade 3 intensity, which is
not unexpected due to the rapid cell destruction induced by ofatumumab. Three patients had
hyperuricemia reported as an AE of which one was considered by the investigator to be related to
ofatumumab. Despite these results, no AEs of tumour lysis syndrome were reported as of the cut-off
date (19 May 2008).
Of the 6 patients who had AEs associated with potassium levels, none of these AEs were considered
related to ofatumumab by the investigator. For the 5 patients that had laboratory transitions from
Grade 0, 1 or 2 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 on study, all normalized and none of these patients had
concomitant AEs related to cardiac dysfunction.
A total of 3 patients had decreased laboratory values for sodium. Each of these patients had a single
Grade 3 sodium value. One of these 3 abnormal sodium values was reported by the investigator as an
AE considered by the investigator to be related to ofatumumab. The same patient also had arrhythmia
reported on study day 86 during the dosing period, 5 days prior to laboratory assessment that revealed
decreased sodium.
Three patients had creatinine abnormalities that were reported as adverse events. None of these
abnormalities were >Grade 2 and patients recovered from each event.
Grade 3 hepatobiliary abnormalities were observed in 1% of the 154 subjects. There were no Grade 4
hepatobiliary abnormalities reported. No subject had concurrent elevation of GPT (ALT) and total
bilirubin.

- Safety in special populations

Adverse events were analysed in the pivotal study by age. The incidence of AEs was higher in subjects
 65 years of age compared with the younger subject population. Overall, the incidence of AEs was

Page 51 of 63


-----

92% in subjects <65 years of age, 98%  in subjects ≥65 years of age, and 94% in subjects ≥75 years of
age. There were few notable differences in the AE profile based upon age, though interpretation is
limited by the small number of subjects in the oldest age group and the small number of subjects with
AEs in each age (data not shown).
Among all subjects in the pivotal study, the overall incidence of AEs was similar in male subjects and
female subjects. Male subjects had higher rates of respiratory tract infections and fatigue while female
subjects had higher rates of anaemia (data not shown).
The majority (94-97%) of subjects in all studies were Caucasian. Therefore, no meaningful clinical
conclusions can be drawn from analyses of AEs by race.
No specific studies of the effect of renal or hepatic impairment have been submitted with ofatumumab,
nor has it been administered to subjects with significant hepatic or renal impairment.
No studies addressing the effect of ofatumumab on male and female fertility and on pregnant and
lactating women were submitted. No information on the use of ofatumumab in children or adolescents
was submitted.

- Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical safety).

- Discontinuation due to adverse events

In the pivotal Study Hx-CD20-406, 27 (17%) of 154 subjects had AEs that led to withdrawal from
treatment (21 subjects) or follow-up (6 subjects) as of the data cut-off date of 19 May 2008. 14
subjects discontinued due to fatal infections (8 DR subjects, 5 BFR subjects, 1 Other subject). The
most common AEs that resulted in withdrawal were pneumonia (6 subjects: 4 DR, 2 BFR) and sepsis
(6 subjects: 4 DR, 2 BFR).
The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to withdrawal (excluding 5 subjects who discontinued
due to disease progression but were listed as AEs) was higher in the DR group than in the BFR group
(DR: 11/59 [19%]; BFR: 8/79 [10%], respectively). In the Other group, 3/16 subjects (19%) had an
AE that led to withdrawal.
The majority of subjects had AEs leading to discontinuation that were considered by the investigator
to be not related to study drug (23/27, 85%). Four subjects had AEs that were considered to be related
to study medication; 2 in the DR group (pneumonia and hypersensitivity), 1 in the BFR group
(pneumonia) and 1 in the Other group (neutropenia).
Nineteen subjects had 20 SAEs resulting in withdrawal from treatment or follow-up and 11 subjects
were withdrawn due to SAEs with fatal outcome.

- Post marketing experience

Not applicable.

- Discussion on clinical safety

The CHMP considered that the safety profile of ofatumumab could not be sufficiently characterised
due to the uncontrolled design of the pivotal trial. Particular concern was raised with regard to
infections and deaths, the latter resulting primarily from infections. The SAG Oncology was consulted
as to whether the safety profile was sufficiently evaluated. The SAG considered that this toxicity is not
unacceptable compared to other salvage regimens that are commonly used in this setting, based on the
literature. For instance, Tam et al reporting on 58 fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory CLL
patients treated at a single institution found that early deaths (defined as death within 8 weeks of
starting therapy) occurred in 16% of patients and 60% of patients suffered major infections. The phase
II study reported by Perkins et al (2002), although on 27 patients, reports 89% severe infections and
48% fatal infections. The SAG agreed by consensus that for patients with double-refractory disease,
the toxicity profile has been sufficiently evaluated and is considered acceptable.

Ofatumumab was associated with infusion reactions leading to temporary interruption of treatment or
withdrawal of treatment. Pre-medications attenuate infusion reactions but these may still occur,
predominantly during the first infusion. Infusion reactions may include anaphylactoid events, cardiac
events, chills/rigors, cough, cytokine release syndrome, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, fatigue, flushing,
hypertension, hypotension, nausea, pain, pyrexia, rash, and urticaria. Even with pre-medication,
severe reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, were reported. In cases of severe infusion
reaction, the infusion must be interrupted immediately and symptomatic treatment instituted.

Infusion reactions occur more frequently on the first day of infusion and tend to decrease with
subsequent infusions. Patients with a history of decreased pulmonary function may be at a greater risk
for pulmonary complications from severe reactions and should be monitored closely during infusion
(see SPC section 4.2 and 4.4).

Arzerra should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of cancer
therapy and in an environment where full resuscitation facilities are immediately available (see SPC
section 4.2).

Patients should be premedicated prior to Arzerra infusion according to the dosing schedule described
in the SPC (see SPC section 4.2).

Arzerra is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to ofatumumab or to any of the excipients (see
SPC section 4.3).

In patients with CLL, tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur with use of ofatumumab. Management
of TLS includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function, maintenance of
fluid balance and supportive care (see SPC section 4.4).

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been reported in CLL patients
receiving cytotoxic pharmacotherapy, including ofatumumab. A diagnosis of PML should be
considered in any patient who reports the new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurologic signs and
symptoms. If a diagnosis of PML is suspected ofatumumab should be discontinued and referral to a
neurologist should be considered (see SPC section 4.4).

The safety of, and ability to generate a primary or anamnestic response to, immunisation with live
attenuated or inactivated vaccines during ofatumumab treatment has not been studied. The response to
vaccination could be impaired when B cells are depleted. Due to the risk of infection, administration
of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during and after treatment with ofatumumab, until B cell
counts are normalized. The risks and benefits of vaccinating patients during ofatumumab therapy
should be considered (SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).

Hepatitis B infection (HBV), including fatal infection, can occur in patients taking ofatumumab.
Hepatitis B reactivation including fulminant hepatitis and death occurs with other monoclonal
antibodies directed against CD20. Patients at high risk of HBV infection should be screened before
initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory
signs of active HBV infection during treatment with and for 6-12 months following the last infusion.
Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop viral hepatitis, and appropriate treatment
should be instituted. Insufficient data exist regarding the safety of administration of ofatumumab in
patients with active hepatitis (see SPC section 4.4).

Patients with a history of cardiac disease should be monitored closely. Ofatumumab should be
discontinued in patients who experience serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (see SPC
section 4.4).

Bowel obstruction was reported in patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy,
including ofatumumab. Patients who present with abdominal pain, especially early in the course of
therapy, should be evaluated and appropriate treatment instituted (see SPC section 4.4).

Page 53 of 63


-----

Since ofatumumab binds to all CD-20-positive lymphocytes (malignant and non-malignant), complete
blood counts and platelet counts should be obtained at regular intervals during therapy and more
frequently in patients who develop cytopenias (see SPC section 4.4).

Arzerra contains 64.5 mg sodium per 300 mg dose and 430 mg sodium per 2000 mg dose. This
should be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet (see SPC section 4.4).

There are no data from the use of ofatumumab in pregnant women. The effect on human pregnancy is
unknown. Besides an expected pharmacological effect, i.e., depletion of B-cells, animal studies do not
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maternal toxicity, pregnancy or
embryonal/foetal development (see section 5.3). Pre- and postnatal development studies have not
been performed with ofatumumab. Ofatumumab should not be administered to pregnant women
unless the possible benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risk to the foetus. Women of
childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after the last
ofatumumab treatment (see SPC section 4.6).

The safe use of ofatumumab in humans during lactation has not been established. The excretion of
ofatumumab in milk has not been studied in animals. It is not known whether ofatumumab is secreted
in human milk; however, human IgG is secreted in human milk. Published data suggest that neonatal
and infant consumption of breast milk does not result in substantial absorption of these maternal
antibodies into circulation. Breastfeeding should be discontinued for the duration of treatment with
Arzerra unless the possible benefit outweighs the possible risk (see SPC section 4.6).

There are no data on the effects of ofatumumab on human fertility. Effects on male and female
fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies (see SPC section 4.6).

No studies on the effects of Arzerra on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
No detrimental effect on such activities are predicted from the pharmacology of Arzerra. The clinical
status of the subject and the ADR profile of Arzerra should be borne in mind when considering the
patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills (see SPC section
4.7).

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.
### **2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation **

**Quality**

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the defined
conditions in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.
Commitments are made by the applicant to update some missing information, which does not impact
on the risk benefit assessment of the mAb.

**Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology**

Ofatumumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that binds specifically to a distinct epitope
encompassing both the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The CD20 molecule
is a transmembrane phosphoprotein expressed on B lymphocytes from the pre-B to mature B
lymphocyte stage and on B cell tumours. The B cell tumours include CLL, that generally expresses
lower levels of CD20, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, with high CD20 expression occurring on >90%
tumours. The CD20 molecule is not shed from the cell surface and is not internalised following
antibody binding.

The binding of ofatumumab to the membrane-proximal epitope of the CD20 molecule induces
recruitment and activation of the complement pathway at the cell surface, leading to complementdependent cytotoxicity and resultant lysis of tumour cells. Ofatumumab has been shown to induce
appreciable lysis of cells with high expression levels of complement defence molecules. Ofatumumab
has also been shown to induce cell lysis in both high and low CD20 expressing cells and in rituximabresistant cells. In addition, the binding of ofatumumab allows the recruitment of natural killer cells
allowing the induction of cell death through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Preclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans.
Intravenous and subcutaneous administration to monkeys resulted in the expected depletion of
peripheral and lymphoid tissue B cell counts with no associated toxicological findings. As anticipated,
a reduction in the IgG humoral immune response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin was noted, but there
were no effects on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. In a few animals, increased red cell
destruction occurred as a result of monkey anti-drug antibodies coating the red cells. A corresponding

increase in reticulocyte counts seen in these monkeys was indicative of a regenerative response in the
bone marrow.

Intravenous administration of ofatumumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at 100 mg/kg once
weekly from days 20 to 50 of gestation did not elicit maternal or foetal toxicity or teratogenicity. At
day 100 of gestation, as expected, B-cells were depleted in foetal cord blood and foetal splenic tissues.

As ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies have not been
conducted with ofatumumab.

**Efficacy**

The planned interim analysis of an ongoing pivotal study Hx-CD20-406 (single-arm, open-label,
multicentre), and one completed supportive study, Hx-CD20-402 (open-label, dose ranging,
multicentre) supported the efficacy of ofatumumab in the treatment of CLL.

In the pivotal trial, ofatumumab was administered as a monotherapy to 154 patients with CLL. Of
these 154 patients, 138 were refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab therapy (n=59), or were
refractory to fludarabine and had bulky lymphadenopathy (defined as at least one lymph node > 5cm)
and were inappropriate for alemtuzumab therapy (bulky fludarabine refractory, n=79). Patients
received 300 mg Arzerra in the first infusion and 2000 mg Arzerra for all subsequent infusions. The
infusion schedule was 8 consecutive weekly infusions, followed 5 weeks later by a single infusion for
the following 4 consecutive months. The primary endpoint of this ongoing study was response rate
over a 24 week period. The overall response rates were 58% in the fludarabine and alemtuzumab
refractory group and 47% in the bulky fludarabine refractory group. All responses were partial
remissions, with the exception of one patient in the bulky fludarabine refractory group who achieved a
complete remission.

In the supportive trial, 33 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL received 4 weekly infusions of
ofatumumab with 27/33 in the highest dose group (1st dose: 500 mg; 2nd, 3rd and 4th dose: 2000 mg).
Treatment with ofatumumab led to a 50% objective response rate in the highest dose group and
included 12 partial remissions and one nodular partial remission.

**Safety**

Infections and infusion reactions occurred in 70% and 64%, respectively, of ofatumumab treated CLL
patients in the pivotal trial Hx-CD20-406. Other common adverse events were: pyrexia, cough,
diarrhoea, neutropenia, anaemia, fatigue and dyspnoea. Infusion reactions occurred with the greatest
incidence (44%) on the first infusion day (300 mg or 500 mg), decreased to 26% with the second
infusion (2000 mg) and declined further during subsequent infusions (2000 mg). A total of 21% of
subjects in the pivotal trial had an adverse event in the Infections and infestations SOC that was
considered related to treatment. Symptoms that characterize infusion reactions were considered drugrelated in 47% of the subjects.

The most common serious adverse events observed in CLL clinical trials with ofatumumab included
infections, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. The majority of deaths occurred in the course of
infection, although it is noted that the disease also predisposes to infection and the minority of
infections and infectious deaths were considered related to ofatumumab treatment.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in CLL clinical trials have been included in
the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

- User consultation

A User Testing Report was submitted. The results and user comments were incorporated in the
finalisation of the Package Leaflet and the result is considered satisfactory.

**Risk-benefit assessment**

Ofatumumab treatment was accompanied by a high response rate in CLL patients refractory to
fludarabine and alemtuzumab treatment (58%) and a slightly lower response rate (47%) in fludarabine
refractory bulky lymphadenopathy patients for whom aletuzumab therapy is considered inappropriate.
At the same time, the use of ofatumumab was accompanied by serious and life-threatening
complications (infections and neutropenia), which, however, are also manifestations of the underlying
disease, so that the safety profile does not cause particular concern overall. Having considered the
argumentation put forward by the Applicant and the recommendation of the oncology Scientific
Advisory group (SAG), the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk of ofatumumab is positive for the
double (fludarabine and alemtuzumab) refractory population but not for the fludarabine refractory,
bulky lymphadenopathy population. However, there is a need to further confirm the positive benefitrisk in the double refractory population through the conduct of controlled trials in CLL disease settings
in which such trials are feasible (fludarabine refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy population and earlier
lines of therapy). Thus, the CHMP proposed a conditional marketing authorisation, after having
consulted the applicant. The CHMP considered that ofatumumab is both a medicinal product which
aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease and an orphan medicinal product, and therefore falls
within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006. Moreover, the CHMP considered that ofatumumab
fulfils the requirements of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 based on the following grounds:

(a) Efficacy in terms of response rate was demonstrated in a pivotal and a supportive open label,
single arm trials conducted in fludarabine and alemtuzumab double-efractory patients. Overall, a
response rate of 58% was observed. Treatment with ofatumumab was associated with adverse events
indistinguishable from the underlying disease which don’t give rise to particular concern. Therefore,
the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product, as defined in Article 1(28a) of Directive
2001/83/EC, is positive.

(b) There is a need to gain more understanding about the benefit-risk profile of ofatumumab. To
this end, the applicant will provide comprehensive clinical data from ongoing Phase III randomised,
controlled clinical studies in earlier disease settings. In addition, it is important to further confirm the
high response rate and control of the disease in the refractory setting through controlled trials and
extended ofatumumab treatment. The applicant will conduct a controlled trial comparing ofatumumab
against physician’s choice in fludarabine refractory, bulky lymphadenopathy patients. After 24 weeks
of treatment, patients on the ofatumumab arm will be further randomised to either extended
ofatumumab treatment or to observation alone. Finally, the applicant will conduct a Phase IV
observational study. The applicant has provided draft proposals and estimated timelines as well as
assurance about the feasibility of the last two studies. The timelines of these studies will be confirmed
upon submission of the final study protocols within three months of the conditional marketing
authorisation date. Thus, it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the
comprehensive clinical data.

(c) Currently there are no approved treatment options for fludarabine and alemtzumab refractory
CLL patients. Ofatumumab has shown a high response rate and this effect was clinically significant in
this patient population. In accordance with the definition of Article 4, paragraph 2, of Regulation (EC)
No 507/2006, the medicinal product concerned will be of major therapeutic advantage to those
affected. Therefore, unmet medical needs will be fulfilled.

(d) In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the immediate availability on the market
outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.

A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the
opinion that:

  - routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product

Page 61 of 63


-----

  - no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product
information.

**Recommendation**

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Arzerra in the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia
(CLL) in patients refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab was favourable and therefore
recommended the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation.
