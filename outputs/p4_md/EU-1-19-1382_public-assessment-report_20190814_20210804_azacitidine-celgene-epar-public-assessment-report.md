### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1. Problem statement *** **Disease or condition **

MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) is a rare and life threatening disease that can affect children and adults,

although the highest prevalence occurs in those over 60 years of age. The incidence of MDS has been

estimated as 4.1/100,000 population. The incidence rises with increasing age: 4.9 for people aged 50 to

70 years and 22.8 for people older than 70 years.

MDS encompasses a group of haematological disorders that is characterised by clonal haematopoietic

stem cell disorder, usually of the granulocytic, erythroid or platelet lineage, that results in abnormalities

in proliferation, differentiation and maturation of the myeloid lineage. This leads to one or more

peripheral cytopenias and progressive bone marrow failure. As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for

symptomatic anaemia, infection and bleeding.

The clinical presentation of MDS is generally non-specific. However, initial findings of MDS can usually be

attributed to the underlying cytopenias. MDS can arise de novo (primary MDS) or following treatment

with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or chemical injury (secondary MDS). Depending on the subtype of

myelodysplasia, there is a risk of approximately 50% for development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML),

which is often refractory to standard treatment.

The diagnosis and classification of MDS can be based on two classification systems, the

French-American-British (FAB) classification system and the WHO classification system (table 1).

The International Prognostic Scoring System issued in 1997 provides a method for evaluating clinical

prognostic risk factors for patients with MDS. The 3 critical factors include risk-based cytogenetic

subgroups (good, intermediate, and poor), bone marrow blast percentage and cytopenias. Patients are

grouped into 4 risk categories based on total scores from these prognostic factors (table 2).
##### **Table 2 IPSS for MDS - Prognostic risk based survival and AML evolution **
###### Total Score Value 0 0.5-1.0 1.5-2.0 ≥ 2.5 Clinical outcome Low Intermediate-1 Intermediate-2 High Overall Survival (median in years) 5.7 3.5 1.2 0.4 25% AML evolution ( median in years ) 9.4 3.3 1.1 0.2

Total Score Value is determined based on the combination of individual score of bone marrow blasts, karyotype and cytopenia

Despite current treatment strategies, approximately half of the patient population with MDS dies within 4

years. Cure may be achieved only in patients who can receive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell

transplantation (allo HSCT). However, depending on a patient’s age and general health condition, best

supportive care (BSC), consisting in transfusions, growth factors, iron chelation therapy, is most

frequently applied. Otherwise, low-dose chemotherapy or standard combination chemotherapy may be

used for the various subclasses of MDS but without a standard approach of care. Only intensive

chemotherapy followed by allo HSCT was shown to result in improved survival in patients with

Intermediate-2 or high risk MDS or AML that progressed from MDS (AML-MDS) when compared with

non-intensive treatment or supportive care only (actuarial survival at 4 years of 26% vs. 10%).

AML evolving from MDS is often less responsive to standard treatment than de novo AML. The usually

higher age at diagnosis makes these patients more vulnerable to toxic effects from induction- and

consolidation chemotherapy (with e.g., cytarabine, etoposide and idarubicin) and the HSCT.

##### **About the product **

Azacitidine belongs to the group ‘anti-metabolites’. Azacitidine is an analogue of cytidine, which means

that it is incorporated into the genetic material of cells (RNA and DNA). It is thought to work by altering

the way the cell turns genes on and off and also by interfering with the production of new RNA and DNA.

These actions are thought to correct the problems with the maturation and growth of young blood cells in

the bone marrow that cause myelodysplastic disorders, and to kill cancerous cells in leukaemia.

This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of

Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.

Accordingly, the MAH of the reference product, Vidaza, has provided consent to allow access to Module 2

to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and

approved. The complete assessment history of Vidaza is available on the EMA website.

The proposed indication for Azacitidine Celgene is the same as the approved indication for the reference

product. ***2.2. Quality aspects ***

Since this application is an informed consent of the Vidaza application, the quality data in support of the

Azacitidine Celgene application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Vidaza dossier, which

have been assessed and approved. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects ***

No non-clinical data have been submitted in the Azacitidine Celgene dossier. Since this application is an

informed consent of the Vidaza application, the non-clinical data in support of the Azacitidine Celgene

application are identical to the up-to-date non-clinical data of the Vidaza dossier, which have been

assessed and approved. **2.3.1. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

An environmental Risk Assessment has been provided, which is identical to the one that was submitted

for Vidaza.

Azacitidine Celgene is submitted as an informed consent application intended to be administered at the

same dose levels as Vidaza and for the same indication as already approved in the EU. Based on the

assumption that the product is to be substituted for the identical product Azacitidine Celgene, the

approval of the product does not result in an increase of the total quantity of the active ingredients

released into the environment. ***2.4. Clinical aspects ***

No clinical data have been provided within this application. Since this application is an informed consent

of the Vidaza application, the clinical data in support of the Azacitidine Celgene application are identical to

the up-to-date clinical data of the Vidaza dossier, which have been assessed and approved by the CHMP.

Following the signal of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy for Azacitidine - VIDAZA (EPITT ref.

No. 19422), the PRAC has agreed that the MAH for Vidaza (Celgene) should submit by 28 August 2019,

a cumulative review of all cases of progressive multifocal leukoencelopathy associated with azacitidine.

The outcome of this post-authorisation commitment should be implemented in Azacitidine Celgene.

The submitted Risk Management Plan (version 15.0), is identical to the latest approved RMP for the

reference product.

In line with the reference product the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the

risks of the product in the proposed indications.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/445484/2019 Page 9/12


-----

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application, is of the opinion that no additional

risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.
##### ***2.6. Pharmacovigilance *** ***Pharmacovigilance system ***

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. ***Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements ***

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out

in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC

and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. ***2.7. New Active Substance ***

The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that azacitidine is not a new active substance, as it is

a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. Azacitidine is

contained in the marketing authorisation Vidaza which was authorised in the European Union on 17

December 2008. ***2.8. Product information *** **2.8.1. User consultation **

A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet

has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:

The Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product, Vidaza, was the subject of a user testing

study, which was completed successfully in January 2008.

As the Patient Information Leaflet for Azacitidine Celgene is identical (with the exception of the product

name) to that of the reference product, the user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet for the

reference product can be taken to apply equally to Azacitidine Celgene.
### **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **

The application has been submitted in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended

(Informed consent Application) under automatic access to the centralised procedure.

Azacitidine Celgene is identical to Vizada, previously approved by the CHMP. The quality, non-clinical,

efficacy and safety data for Azacitidine Celgene is therefore considered satisfactory and the benefit-risk

profile for Azacitidine Celgene is positive.

Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/445484/2019 Page 10/12


-----

### **4. Recommendations **
##### ***Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products ***

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Azacitidine Celgene is not similar to Revlimid, Dacogen,

Rydapt, Mylotarg or Vyxeos within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

See appendix 1. ***Outcome ***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that

the benefit-risk balance of Azacitidine Celgene is favourable in the following indication:

Azacitidine Celgene is indicated for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for haematopoietic

stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with:

  - intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) according to the International

Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS),

  - chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) with 10-29 % marrow blasts without

myeloproliferative disorder,

  - acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with 20-30 % blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia, according to

World Health Organisation (WHO) classification,

  - AML with >30% marrow blasts according to the WHO classification.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

conditions: ***Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use ***

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product

Characteristics, section 4.2). ***Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation ***

**Periodic Safety Update Reports**

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out

in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC
