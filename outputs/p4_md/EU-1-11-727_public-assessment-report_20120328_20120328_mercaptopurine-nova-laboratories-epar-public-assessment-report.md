## **2. Scientific discussion **

### ***2.1. Introduct***

### ***ion ***


**Problem statement**

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is a malignant proliferation of lymphoid cells (blast cells), a
biologically heterogeneous disorder among patients. A clinical diagnosis is generally refined using
morphologic, immunologic, cytogenetic, biochemical and molecular genetics tests of bone marrowderived blasts. These tests classify patients into two broad subsets, namely ‘T’ and ‘B’ cell, and thence
into subtypes of ‘T’ and ‘B’ cell leukaemia. The clinical and biological characterisation of a patient’s
disease are used together to direct treatment and as a guide to prognosis.
ALL is the most common malignancy diagnosed in children, representing nearly one third of childhood
cancers. Although a few cases of ALL are associated with inherited genetic syndromes, the cause of
ALL remains largely unknown.

The lymph nodes, liver and spleen are the most common sites of extra-medullary involvement in ALL.
These organs and tissues are enlarged as a result of infiltration by blasts. Lymph node, hepatic or
splenic enlargement may be asymptomatic. However, intra-thoracic lymph node enlargement can
present as a mediastinal mass with associated respiratory difficulty. Central nervous system and, in

boys, testicular involvement is less common. Signs or symptoms of CNS involvement include headache,

nausea and vomiting, lethargy, irritability, neck stiffness and papilloedema. Signs of cranial nerve
involvement (the third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves are most frequently involved) may
occur. ALL can also present as an intracranial or spinal mass causing numerous neurological symptoms,
most of which are due to nerve compression. Testicular involvement appears as painless testicular
enlargement and is most often unilateral.

The achievement of a complete remission is a prerequisite for the long-term survival of patients with
acute leukemia. First remissions in ALL using amethopterin, an analogue of methotrexate were
demonstrated in 1948 (Sidney Farber). Since then, combinations of various agents have been
successful in inducing remissions, such as vincristine and prednisone(or dexamethasone),
Daunorubicin and L -asparaginase (or PEG– L -asparaginase). The use of additional drugs, such as the
anthracyclines (daunorubicin or doxorubicin) or cyclophosphamide is often reserved for children with
high-risk ALL.

It has been estimated that approximately two to three logs of leukemic blasts are killed during the
induction phase of therapy, leaving a residual leukemic burden of approximately 100 million cells.
Therefore, additional treatment is necessary to prevent relapse. In the past, children with ALL relapsed
within a median of 4 to 6 months when treatment was not continued beyond the remission induction

phase. In the late 1960s, investigators at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital developed a "total

therapy" approach for the treatment of children with ALL. The model included remission induction,

continuation chemotherapy with or without intensification, and preventive CNS therapy. The choice of

continuation therapy was empiric. The early St. Jude studies evaluated 6-mercaptopurine,
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine in various doses and combinations. The best
outcome was achieved in patients who received 2 to 3 years of daily oral 6-mercaptopurine and
weekly methotrexate. Long-term follow-up of patients treated with this latter combination show a 42%

disease-free survival rate for children with initial WBC counts of fewer than 25,000 cells per L,

whereas it was only 16% for all other patients. Recent clinical trials have confirmed the importance of
intensive re-induction therapy or dose-intensified antimetabolite therapy, even for patients with
favorable risk features.

**About the product**

The development of the purine analogues in cancer chemotherapy (deVita et al 2005) began in the
early 1950s with the synthesis of thiopurines. The purine analogues 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and
6-thioguanine (6-TG) continue to be used principally in the management of acute leukemia. 6-MP has
an important role in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas 6-TG is

active in remission induction and in maintenance therapy for AML. These analogues have a single
substitution of a thiol group in place of the 6-hydroxyl group of the purine base. 6-MP is a structural
analogue of hypoxanthine, whereas 6-TG is an analogue of guanine. 6-MP is an inactive pro-drug
which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake and intracellular anabolism to

thioguanine nucleotides for cytotoxicity. Finally, azathioprine is a derivative of 6-MP and acts as a
prodrug to provide sustained release of 6-MP.

                  Figure 1 The metabolic fate of 6 Mercaptopurine

6-MP in its monophosphate nucleotide form inhibits *de novo* purine synthesis and purine
interconversion reactions, whereas the nucleotide triphosphate metabolites are incorporated directly
into nucleic acids. The relative contribution of each of these actions to the mechanism of cytotoxicity is
unclear. 6-MP is converted to monophosphate forms by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl
transferase (HGPRT). The ribonucleotide monophosphate inhibits the first step of *de novo* purine
synthesis catalyzed by glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate aminotransferase and block the

conversion of inosinic acid to adenylic acid or to guanylic acid. Inhibition of purine nucleotide synthesis
leads to the buildup of 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, which facilitates the activation of 6-MP and
6-TG to their active nucleotide forms by HGPRT. Both thiopurine ribonucleotide and
deoxyribonucleotide metabolites are formed, which can then be incorporated into cellular RNA and

DNA, respectively. In some experimental model systems, incorporation of thiopurine nucleotides into

DNA correlates with cytotoxicity.

The efficacy of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) for the treatment of ALL has been established over many
years through a number of national and international trials. Consequently, all treatment protocols used

by EU member nations for treating childhood ALL include oral 6-MP. Actual daily doses of 6-MP for the

treatment of childhood ALL appear to vary from as little as 7.5 mg to a high of 125 mg. There is no
maximum dose of 6-mercaptopurine recommended, as the dosage should be adjusted to suit the
individual patient, based on absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelet count.

Currently, 6-MP is only available as oral tablet which poses a number of difficulties for the patients and
the care giver, especially when used in children. However, for standard maintenance therapy, most
children need doses other than that obtained from the 50 mg tablet. In addition, taking whole tablets
can be difficult especially in young children and that means that the tablet has to be crushed, which
also involves safety risks for the person handling the tablet.

The rationale for the development of Novapurine oral suspension was that a liquid formulation would
provide advantages over the single-strength, solid tablet for the treatment of a serious disease in
children. The proposed oral suspension offers more flexibility and accuracy in terms of dosing and
improved ease of administration (and hence compliance) for children. This is particularly important
given that the ideal dosing is to titrate according to haematological values.
Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories oral suspension (20 mg/ ml) contains 6-MP as monohydrate. The
applicant applied for the following indication: *treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It may*
*be utilised in induction and consolidation phases of therapy of ALL. It is particularly indicated, however,*
*for the continuous phase of therapy* . The finally approved indication is: *Mercaptopurine Nova*
*Laboratories is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults,*
*adolescents and children* . The dose is governed by cautiously monitored haematotoxicity and the dose
should be carefully adjusted to suit the individual patient in accordance with the employed treatment

protocol. Depending on phase of treatment, starting or target doses generally vary between

25-75 mg/m [2] body surface area (BSA) per day.
### ***Type of application and aspects on development ***

The Applicant submitted on 22 [nd] February 2010 a request for accelerated assessment. The request
was rejected since, even though an age appropriate formulation is expected to facilitate the
administration of 6-MP to children, the currently available formulation (Puri-Nethol 50 mg tablet) has

been used to treat children for many years with good treatment results, and therefore the unmet
medical need was questioned.

Mercaptopurine was designated as an Orphan Drug for ALL on 30 April 2009 (EU/3/09/628). ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

This Marketing authorization application concerns a centralized procedure for Mercaptopurine Nova
Laboratories 20mg/ml oral suspension from Nova Laboratories Ltd. The drug product has been granted

### ***Manufacture ***

The description of the manufacturing process includes a micronisation step and the process controls

have been provided along with a synthesis chart. Information related to the reagents and raw

materials (solvents, catalysts) and conditions of synthesis is considered satisfactory.

Full details of the manufacturing process are presented in an Active Substance Master File (ASMF).

The structure of the active substance has been fully elucidated on one batch of in-house reference
material by [13] C NMR and [1] H NMR (Nuclear magnetic Resonance), MS (Mass Spectrometry), IR
(infrared), and UV (ultraviolet) spectroscopy.

A discussion on potential impurities of mercaptopurine including their structure and limits was
presented in the application including organic impurities, degradation products and residual solvents. ***Specification ***

Specification of the active substance mercaptopurine includes the following tests: identification (UV

Ph.Eur. and IR), sulphated ash (Ph.Eur.), assay (Ph.Eur.), water content (Ph.Eur. Karl-Fischer), organic

volatile impurities (GC), residual solvents (GC), related substances (HPLC), particle size distribution

(laser diffraction).

Specifications applied by the drug product manufacturer are in accordance with the Ph.Eur. monograph.
Additionally, the active substance manufacturer applies internal specifications for related substances,
residual solvents, and particle size distribution. Limits for residual solvents are below the ICH Q3C
recommended levels.

Regarding the analytical methods, the active substance manufacturer has used the Ph.Eur. methods
except for the additional tests, where in-house methods are used and described. The validation of the

in-house methods has been presented and followed the ICH guidelines.

Results were presented for 3 commercial scale batches of mercaptopurine from the ASMF holder and
from the finished product manufacturer and the results were found in line with the specification.

The results were compliant with the Ph.Eur. Additional specifications for residual solvents are set by
the drug substance manufacturer and are in accordance with ICH Q3C. Specifications for particle size
were considered acceptable.

The primary packaging is made of transparent polyethylene bags, placed into black bags and then in

fibre or plastic drums. The material complies with the Ph.Eur. The in-house specification includes

identification by IR and thickness.

The ASMF holder declared that the polyethylene bag is suitable for pharmaceutical materials and
provided certificate of analysis from the supplier (stating conformity to the Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.3)
and metal residues analysis results. A certificate of suitability (CEP) has been granted by EDQM for the

active substance in the packaging material “transparent polyethylene bag”, therefore the information
provided was deemed sufficient. ***Stability ***

Stability data have been presented on 10 commercial scale batches kept in the commercial packaging
under ICH long term conditions (up to 60 months at 25°C/60%RH) and accelerated conditions (6
months at 40°C/75%RH). In addition, a forced degradation study has been performed and showed that
the HPLC method was stability indicating.

Under long-term and accelerated conditions, no significant changes have been noted for assay, water
content, and related substances. Results on long term (25°C/60%RH) and accelerated (40°C/75%RH)
conditions were conformed to the specification throughout the duration of the study.

A satisfactory re-test period under the recommended storage conditions (room temperature, protected
from light) has been justified.
### ***Comparability exercise for Active Substance ***

Not applicable **2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product **

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories 20mg/ml oral suspension is an aqueous suspension of
mercaptopurine. It is packed in 100ml amber glass bottles, closed with tamper evident, child resistant

cap.

The medicinal product contains the following compendial excipients: xanthan gum (viscosity modifier),
aspartame (sweetener), concentrated raspberry juice (flavouring agent), methyl parahydroxybenzoate
and propyl parahydroxybenzoate (antimicrobial preservative), water (diluent/vehicle). The composition

of the concentrated raspberry juice has been detailed.

The suspension is filled into amber glass bottles at a nominal fill of 100 ml, and closed with a
polyethylene screw cap. In use, a polyethylene adaptor is inserted to facilitate the use of a dosing
syringe. Graduated 1 ml and 5 ml dosing syringes are provided with each bottle. The bottle and other
components are packed in a cardboard carton. ***Pharmaceutical Development ***

Mercaptopurine is a well studied active substance that has been on the market for several decades in
the EU in the form of a tablet formulation. It is described as “practically insoluble in water” in the Ph
Eur therefore is an ideal candidate for a suspension formulation. Mercaptopurine is labile in both strong
acid and base; but in neutral pH it is stable in suspension. Furthermore, the limited solubility reduces
the unpleasant taste of the active substance and simplifies the taste masking procedure, and
consequently also patient compliance.
The fine particle size distribution of the drug substance, as chosen, helps improving suspension
physical stability and the content uniformity of the product, and improved also compliance by
eliminating “grittiness” from larger particles.
Since Mercaptopurine is cytotoxic, the formulation design has to take into account minimisation of the
potential for unnecessary contact with users and patients during use.

The excipients included in Mercaptopurine 20 mg/ ml suspension are well established compendial
excipients (Ph.Eur except the raspberry flavour that complies with the British Pharmacopoeia 1988
monograph). Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients is known due to the applicant’s
earlier experience of extemporaneous manufacture of mercaptopurine suspensions and has since been

supported by stability tests. The strength of the formulation is chosen to give a typical oral drug
product dose volume of 1–5 ml.

Excipients used are namely: xanthan gum (viscosity agent), aspartame (sweetener), concentrated
raspberry juice (flavouring agent), methyl para-hydroxy benzoate (antimicrobial preservative), propyl
para-hydroxy benzoate (antimicrobial preservative),
Concentrated raspberry juice is prepared from the juice of *rubus lutaeus* L. with sucrose added to
adjust the weight per ml in the final concentrate. Sulphur dioxide is also added as a preservative and
limited without safety concern.
The role of xantham gum and raspberry flavour and their concentration in the finished product are well
justified. Xanthan gum modifies the viscosity and thus physically stabilises the suspension to allow
accurate dosing.

Aspartame was used to improve the taste. Sucrose as a sweetening agent was not considered
appropriate for chronic medication, due to the potential for causing dental caries over the 2 to 3 year
treatment period.
The preservatives methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate are included in the
formulation, due to the multidose use of the product.
The Applicant intends to introduce a revised preservative system by variation of the Marketing
Authorization. Refer to section 2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

The analytical procedures used are those described in the Ph.Eur. monograph. Validation was therefore

not deemed necessary. No justification of the specification was requested since the excipients are all
compendial. Certificates of analysis in line with the specification are included for each excipient.

Although mercaptopurine has been available for several decades in the form of Purinethol tablets, .
there was a need for another formulation to address the treatment of paediatric patients. Furthermore,
the suspension may also be of help for adult patients with swallowing difficulties.

The proposed formulation is an extension of an already successful “Specials” formulation, which is not
authorised but is manufactured under GMP conditions in the UK, developed from it with minimal

change from the composition point of view.

The bioavailability of the suspension has been assessed and compared to Purinethol tablets. The
suspension was shown to be systemically available faster and more reproducibly.
This suspension should allow more accurate dosing and should be more easily accepted, especially by
paediatric patients.

The manufacturing process has been adequately described and can be considered as a standard
process. The process is simple and can be divided into three parts: preparation of the base,
incorporation of the active substance and filling. The manufacturing process has not changed much
since the beginning of the pharmaceutical development. The process allows to maintain the active

substance homogeneity until the end of the filling step.

The drug product is filled into 100 ml amber type III glass bottles with child-resistant cap. An adaptor
is inserted for in-use dose measurements and graduated 1 ml and 5 ml syringes are provided with
each bottle. The container size is chosen to provide sufficient suspension for one month treatment. The
description and the choice of the container have been appropriately detailed. A filling overage of 3 ml
is added to ensure that a nominal volume of 100 ml can be withdrawn.

The drug product is packaged in a glass bottle with a cap/expanded polyethylene wad. In use the cap
is removed, an adaptor for use with HDPE oral dosing syringes is inserted into the neck of the bottle

### ***Manufacture of the product ***

The manufacturing process can be summarised as follows: preparation of the parabens solution, then
dissolution of aspartame, xanthan gum, raspberry flavour and dispersion of Mercaptopurine, and filling
of the bottles. Process parameters have been controlled in a satisfactory manner and in-process
controls included tests such as: mixing speed, mixing duration, bottle filling.

Three consecutive batches of mercaptopurine 20 mg/5 ml oral suspension have been manufactured at
production scale. Process verification data have been provided including: description of the process
parameters, IPC data on the bulk before addition of Mercaptopurine, data recorded on the product
after filling (beginning, middle and end of the filling step). The tests included: appearance, pH, density,
identification of drug substance, drug substance content, preservatives content, aspartame content,

uniformity of mass of delivered dose, dissolution, viscosity and particle size, data on the filling weight.

All data complied with the specifications with an adequate intra and inter batch variability. The data
presented for the three industrial scale batches can stand for a preliminary process validation study. It
can be considered that the manufacturer has good control over the process.

It is declared that Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories 20mg/5ml does not contain any excipient of
human or animal origin. Therefore no TSE risk is anticipated. ***Product specification ***

The release and shelf life specifications of the Mercaptopurine 20 mg/ml suspension are adequate for

this pharmaceutical form and the following parameters are tested: appearance (visual), pH (Ph.Eur.), density (Ph.Eur.), uniformity of mass of delivered doses ( Ph Eur ), viscosity ( Ph. Eur.), particle size ( Ph. Eur. ), dissolution (Ph. Eur. ), mercaptopurine content (HPLC), identification (HPLC, BP method), related

substances (HPLC), preservative content (HPLC), homogeneity of suspension, aspartame content
(HPLC), microbial contamination (Ph.Eur.).

Analytical methods have been described and in-house methods validated in accordance with I *CHQ2*

guidelines.

Results for 3 consecutive production scale batches of the medicinal product were presented,
representative of the manufacturing process.

Batch analysis results conform to specifications and are consistent, batch-to-batch. Specifications are
adequately justified and impurities levels are below the ICH limits and do not present any specific
toxicological concern. ***Stability of the product ***

Stability studies have been conducted on 3 production scale batches under ICH long term (5°C) and
accelerated conditions (25°C/60%RH, 40°C/75%RH). The batches were studied for 12 months at 5°C
and 25°C and 6 months at 40°C.
The following parameters were investigated during those stability studies: appearance, density,
uniformity of mass of delivered doses, viscosity, particle size, dissolution, mercaptopurine content,

identification, related substances, preservative content, homogeneity of suspension, aspartame
content, microbial contamination.
The analytical methods used were the same as those ones used for the control of the finished product.
Post approval, the manufacturer commits to place on stability one batch per year,

The only parameters showing any trend on storage at 25°C/60%RH are aspartame content, viscosity
and propyl parahydroxybenzoate content. The reductions were minimal and results remained within
the finished product acceptance criteria. Therefore, the product remains in specification for at least a
year at 25°C. Preservative efficacy data is included at 12 months for 2 batches performed both by the
finished product manufacturer and at an external specialist contract laboratory. The results complied
with the requirements of Ph.Eur. In addition preservative efficacy results were also included for one
batch after for 18 months at 25°C/60%RH and these results also complied with Ph.Eur.

A change management protocol is in place to re-formulate the preservative system, to eliminate
potential toxicity due to propyl hydroxybenzoate, and to improve the robustness of fungal preservation.

As an interim measure, agreed at a clarification meeting, a shelf life of 1 year is proposed when the

product is stored at a temperature not exceeding 25°C.

In addition, Supportive stability data for the extemporaneous formulation is included in the
documentation, covering twelve batches and 3–26 months data under ambient conditions. Assay

results were reported as variable, which may be caused by factors outside of the control of the drug

product manufacturer. The stability of mercaptopurine in the suspension was unaffected with no
evidence of degradation.

The packaging for mercaptopurine oral suspension consists of a 100ml amber glass bottle as the
primary container within a cardboard box secondary container. A photo-stability study for the
suspension was conducted where samples were exposed to 1.354 million lux hours and 2492 watt
hours/m [2] . Results indicate that storage in amber glass bottles is sufficient protection for
mercaptopurine against photo-degradation. Nevertheless, the data indicate that mercaptopurine is
prone to photodegradation. This is in accordance with the storage condition requirement in the Ph. Eur.
monograph for mercaptopurine which states that it should be stored protected from light.

In use, the patient dose is titrated so that every patient will be administered a dose tailored to their
specific response. The volume of suspension drawn up by each patient therefore varies. An in-use
stability study was conducted on two batches of suspension (12 and 46 weeks old) where 0.5ml of
Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories suspension was withdrawn every working day over a time span of
42 days (6 weeks). This would ensure withdrawal of a typical volume on 30 occasions, which mimics

one month of openings, from a single bottle of suspension. As the study was conducted over an
extended period of time the suspension was subjected to a maximum challenge. There was no

detectable bioburden at the end of the study confirming the efficacy of the preservative system. A

summary of the data showed there was no loss of potency of mercaptopurine during the study and
related substances remained well within specification. All analytical and microbiological parameters

remained within specification over the complete study. Microbiological contamination remained at very

low levels.

In general the results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects ** **Quality Development **

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance mercaptopurine and the

oral suspension has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of test carried out on the

active substance and the drug product indicate adequate consistency and uniformity of important

quality characteristics and these should lead to a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical

practice.

### **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality of the product is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and quality aspects relevant to the uniform performance of the

product have been investigated and satisfactorily controlled. There is no concern related to the TSE

safety. **2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development  **

The applicant should investigate the possibility to eliminate propyl-parahydroxybenzoate from the

formulation. The revised formulation will be introduced by a variation as detailed in the Change
management protocol presented by the applicant. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

As mercaptopurine is a well-known active substance, non-clinical studies have not been submitted and
the application was supported by a literature review. The majority of literature data describing single
dose and repeat dose toxicity were reported in a publication (Clarke et al., 1953).

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP pertaining to the non-clinical aspects of the

dossier and more specifically to the need for non-clinical pharmacology or toxicology studies in relation
to the excipients intended to be used in the ‘to be marketed’ formulation. **2.3.2. Pharmacology ** ***Primary pharmacodynamics ***

*In* vitro, the cytoxicity of 6-MP was investigated in several human leukaemia cell lines.
Exposure of Molt-4 (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line), CCRF-CEM (T-cell acute
lymphocytic leukaemia cell line), HL-60 (acute myeloid leukaemia cell line) and Wilson (Burkitt’s
lymphoma cell line), to 14C-6-MP (10 μM) over a three hour period resulted in a progressive increase
in the intracellular levels of TIMP (predominant metabolite), thioguanosine monophosphate (TGMP) and
6-thioxanthine monophosphate (TXMP). These nucleotide metabolites represented over 80% of the
total metabolites derived from 6-MP (Zimm S et al., 1985).

In Molt F4 cells, exposure to mTIMP reduces cell growth and viability, and the depletion of adenine
nucleotides is thought to be an important contributor in mTIMP mediated cytotoxicity (Stet EH, 1995).

Results of published studies investigating the relationship between incorporation of TGNs into DNA and

cytotoxicity in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell lines and Molt-4 cells have also been provided. In mouse
lymphoma L5178Y cell lines, 0,4% replacement of guanine with TGN was associated with a 99,9% cell
kill rate (Tidd DM, 1974). In some studies, 6-MP has been shown to exhibit classical antimetabolite
cytotoxicity profiles, with cell kill increasing as a function of both drug concentration and exposure time
(Adamson PC et al., 1994). Other studies have found that delayed growth inhibitory effects following a
13 hour exposure time were only found for 6-MP concentrations of 25 -100 μM (Tidd DM, 1974).
Moreover, the Applicant has provided published results of studies investigating the relationship
between incorporation of TGNs into DNA and cytotoxicity in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell lines and
Molt-4 cells. In mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell lines, 0,4% replacement of guanine with TGN was
associated with a 99,9% cell kill rate (Tidd DM, 1974).
In some studies, 6-MP has been shown to exhibit classical antimetabolite cytotoxicity profiles, with cell
kill increasing as a function of both drug concentration and exposure time (Adamson PC et al., 1994).

Other studies have found that delayed growth inhibitory effects following a 13 hour exposure time
were only found for 6-MP concentrations of 25 -100 μM (Tidd DM, 1974).
Similarly, for Molt-4 cells, prolonged exposure to 1 μM 6-MP was not associated with cytotoxicity, and
exposure times of greater than 8 h with 6-MP concentrations >5 μM were required for significant cell
kill (Adamson PC et al.,1994). CCRF-CEM cells too have been shown to require >48 hour exposure to
10 μM 6–MP for any significant cytotoxic effect (da Silva et al., CP 1996).

Results of *in vivo* studies investigating the anti-tumour potency of 6-MP have also been provided. In
mice implanted with S-180 tumours, a dose of 50 mg/kg of 6-MP significantly retarded tumour growth
and delayed tumour-expansion death from 3 to 6 weeks compared to controls. (Clarke DA et al., 1953).
Sugiura (Sugiura K, 1953) showed the activity of MP in altering the growth of a variety of mouse and
rat tumours. 6-MP showed activity in a variety of mouse cell leukaemias (Law LW, 1954; Burchenal JH,
1953; Law LW et al., 1954).

### ***Distribution ***


iscussion on non-clinical


An *in vivo* intravenous distribution study in the monkey has been reported (Narang Pk et.al, 1983).
Following a single intravenous dose of 6-MP, 6-MP in plasma and CSF had a mean half-life,lambda(z),
of 2.9 hours and an apparent volume of distribution (Vd,lambda(z) of 3.00 litres/hr/kg. In the postdistributive phase, the decline of 6-MP concentration from the CSF paralleled that from plasma.
### ***Metabolism***

6-MP is a pro-drug and therefore requires metabolism before being able to exert its therapeutic
cytotoxic effect. It is activated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), followed
by extensive metabolism to TGNs, before being incorporated into the DNA and RNA. The main enzymes
competing for the initial metabolism of 6-MP are HGPRT, thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT),
aldehyde oxidase (AO) and xanthine oxidase (XO). Both XO and AO produce metabolites believed to
have little or no cytotoxic action (Coulthard S et al., 2005).

In vivo studies in rat showed 6-MP undergoes a high rate of first-pass metabolism following oral
administration (Sasaki H et al., 1987).

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report
Page 19


-----

In a study performed in rats after repeated administration of 6-MP by ip route for 12 days (Innocenti F
et al., 1999), 6-MP was actively metabolised. 6-MP biotransformation can be modulated by agents

acting on enzymes of the purine metabolism, resulting in significant changes in erythrocytes and tissue
levels of 6-mercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MPN) and the active 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN).
### ***Excretion ***

No studies and no information from the published literature have been submitted (see discussion on
non-clinical aspects). ***Pharmacokinetic drug interactions ***

*In vivo* studies in rabbit showed that intravenous co-administration of allopurinol with 6-MP caused a

2-fold increase in the half-life and AUC of 6-MP, a 2-fold decrease in total body clearance and an
approximate 3-fold decrease in elimination rate constant. Allopurinol had negligible effects on the

pharmacokinetic parameters of the major metabolite, 6-thiouric acid, suggesting that allopurinol

serves to increase plasma levels of 6-MP by inhibiting its catabolism and thus contributing to a greater

availability of 6-MP to the tissues (Tterlikkis L et Al., 1983). **2.3.4. Toxicology **

The pre-clinical toxicology of mercaptopurine was reported in published reports from 1953 and 1954
(Clarke DA et al., 1953; Philips FS et al., 1954; Sugiura K 1953; Burchenal JH 1954; Law LW 1954;
Law LW et al., 1954) by the same groups that demonstrated its efficacy in mammalian tumours. All
data below come from these reports unless specifically stated otherwise. ***Single dose toxicity ***

Single dose toxicity studies were reported in the literature (Clarke DA et al., 1953). The LD 50 s of
mercaptopurine in mouse, rat and cat by various routes of administration are provided in the following
table.

**Table 1** **: Summary of Single Dose Toxicity of mercaptopurine in various animal**

**species**

Regardless of the route of administration, the pattern of mortality following single high doses of

mercaptopurine were similar in mice with mortality typically occurring 4 to 7 days after dosing, with
animals typically appearing normal for up to 6 hours after dosing. For sub-lethal doses, transient
bodyweight losses were noted for up to a week after dosing which were subsequently recovered during
the following week. Mortality occurred at an earlier stage in rat, with the majority of mortalities
occurring within 24 to 48 hours of dosing. At these high doses, there were severe effects on respiration
in rat which was not noted in mouse.

**Repeat-dose toxicity**

The results of a repeated dose toxicity study performed in dogs and published in the literature have
been provided (Clarke DA et al., 1953) as well as data from a small study in monkeys (Product
Monograph Purinethol, Canada 2003). Results are summarised in the following table:

### ***Genotoxicity ***

As would be expected with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic, mercaptopurine is clearly genotoxic both *in*
*vitro* and *in vivo.*

A number of genotoxicity studies have been reported in the literature. The Applicant has provided an

article of Mosesso P et al, which is a review of data related to the genetic toxicology of 6-MP.
Consistent positive results have been observed for point mutation induction ( *S. typhimurium* ) and
DNA damage in bacteria ( *Bacillus subtilis,* *E. coli* ). [Mosesso P et al., 1993]. In mammalian cells
cultured *in vitro,* including human hepatocytes, positive results were found for the induction of point
mutations, chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). [Mosesso P et al., 1993].
In rodents treated *in vivo,* mercaptopurine clearly induced micronuclei, chromosomal aberrations and
SCEs in somatic cells and dominant lethals, chromosomal aberrations and SCEs in germinal cells.
However, mercaptopurine does not appear to be an inducer of aneuploidy. [Mosesso P et al., 1993]. ***Carcinogenicity ***

In the IARC monograph (1987), it is reported that 6-MP was tested by intraperitoneal administration in
mice and by intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous injection in rats. Limitations to the data in
all reports precluded evaluation of possible carcinogenicity of this compound.

A 2-year carcinogenicity study published in the literature was also provided to document the
carcinogenic potential of 6-MP. In this study (Maekawa A et al., 1990), mercaptopurine was
administered to F344 rats via the diet at dose levels of 0, 25 or 50 ppm for 2 years.
In males, there was no significant increase in the incidence of any tumour in the treated groups over
that arising spontaneously in the control group.
In females, there were positive trends noted in the occurrence of several tumour types, including C-cell
tumours, pheochromotytomas, uterine adenocarcinomas and glioma, with the incidence of C-cell

tumours and pheochromocytomas in the 50 ppm group being significantly higher than in the
concurrent control group.

Mercaptopurine is classified by the IARC as ‘Group 3’, meaning that the evidence of its carcinogenicity

in humans is inadequate, even if mercaptopurine is clearly genotoxic in vitro and in vivo.
### ***Reproduction Toxicity ***

The Applicant has provided an article by Mossesso et al (1993) which is an overview of all available

data on 6-mercaptopurine including studies focusing on teratogenic, embryotoxic and reproductive
effects of the drug compond.

A study designed to evaluate the effects of chemotherapy on the mouse testis found that
mercaptopurine did not affect the viability of differentiated spermatogonia and stem cells as evidenced
by testicular sperm head counts on Days 29 and 56 of treatment. However, there were some large
round spermatids which were presumed to be diploid and a high frequency of abnormally shaped
elongated spermatids (Mosesso P et al., 1993).
Mercaptopurine is embryotoxic in rodents at doses not eliciting maternal toxicity.
In one study mercaptopurine, administered as 2 doses on Days 7 and 8 of gestation, was embryolethal
with 50% and 90% of foetuses being resorbed following doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg/dose, respectively
(Mosesso P et al., 1993) but no malformations were noted.
Embryolethality and teratogenic effects induced by mercaptopurine in rats dosed on Days 7 and 12,

respectively, were also reported (Mosesso P et al., 1993).

Mercaptopurine, when administered to Wistar rats on Days 6-12 of gestation caused 100% death of

embryos while lower doses (0.5-0.75 mg/kg) induced anomalies of the nervous system and the eyes.

Nervous system anomalies were also induced in Swiss Albino mice dosed on Days 6 to 8 of gestation at
doses of 0.5-1 mg/kg.

Limb malformations were seen in both rat (dose of 50 mg/kg on Day 12) and Swiss albino mouse
(dose of 60 mg/kg on Day 11), with mandible malformations also observed in mouse on Day 11 of
gestation (dose of 60 mg/kg).

In rabbits, and in comparison to mouse and rat, far lower doses of 1 mg/kg were sufficient to induce
severe limb malformations.

In addition to a direct lethal effect on foetuses, mercaptopurine reduced the ability of the surviving
female offspring (F1 generation) of mice to reproduce upon reaching maturity, and the number of
foetuses (live and dead) per pregnant mouse was significantly reduced. Histological examination of
ovaries from the F1 offspring revealed reduced numbers of oocytes and ovarian follicles, reflecting the
possible reason for small litter sizes in the offspring. Malformations were observed in the second and
third generation of offspring (Mosesso P et al., 1993). ***Local tolerance ***

The local skin irritation properties of mercaptopurine were studied as part of a transdermal drug
delivery system. No non-clinical studies to assess oropharyngeal toxicity have been submitted (see
discussion on non-clinical aspects). ***Other toxicity studies *** **Immunotoxicity **

The effects of mercaptopurine on immediate and delayed hypersensitivity were studied in the rabbit
(Borel Y, et. al, 1964). Mercaptopurine was show to exert both central and peripheral actions on
immune reactions. The central effects were inhibition of humoural antibody formation and suppression
of delayed hypersensitivity. Mercaptopurine was also able to block the peripheral manifestations of
immunity (skin reactions to antigens) without affecting the immune status of the animal. These various
actions of mercaptopurine were brought out under selected conditions of timing, dosage and mode of
antigen administration. The processes leading to the development of delayed hypersensitivity were

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report
Page 22


-----

found to be very sensitive to the effects of mercaptopurine, with 4 days treatment being able to
suppress this response without inhibiting humoural antibody production or inflammatory responses.
The suppression of skin reactions in hyperimmunized rabbits is presumed by the author of the studies
to be due to an anti-inflammatory effect of mercaptopurine and inhibition of the local passive Arthus

reaction (local type III hypersensitivity reaction) was a function of the amount of antibody in the test

serum.
### **Studies on impurities / excipients **

***Hydroxybenzoate Preservatives***

The proposed oral mercaptopurine suspension contains methylhydroxybenzoate
and propyl-hydroxybenzoate in quantities that are usually recommended for pharmaceutical
formulations. There are numerous data addressing the effect of p-hydroxybenzoic acids on
spermatogenesis and a LOAEL (lowest observed adverse effect level) value of 12.4 mg/kg has been

established for propyl-hydroxybenzoic acid (Johnson and Steer, 2005). The quantity of

propylhydroxybenzoate in this formulation is less than 0.25% of LOAEL at doses typically used in the
treatment of ALL. In the absence of toxicokinetic data and a sufficient number of animals it is not
possible to have a clear idea of the frequency of appearance of observed effects (in particular to
specify a threshold of toxicity).

***Xanthan gum (Xantual 75)***

Xanthan gum (CAS No. 11138-66-2. E415) is a commonly used component of both pharmaceutical

products and foodstuffs, having been extensively tested in animals and accepted as a food additive in

Europe and USA. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) given by the Food and Agricultural Organization of

the United Nations and the World Health Organisation (FAO/WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives

(JECFA) is ‘not specified’ meaning that, on the basis of available data on safety and tolerance, there is
no limit for ADI and the gum may be used at a quantity suitable for its application. The amount of
xanthan gum contained in the proposed mercaptopurine oral suspension is normal for pharmaceutical
formulations.

***Aspartame***

Aspartame (CAS No. 22839-47-0, E951) is an artificial non-saccharide sweetener which is a methyl
ester of the dipeptide of the amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is both widely used as a
sugar substitute in food and beverages and used in pharmaceutical formulations as a sweetening

agent. It is included in the proposed formulation with raspberry juice concentration to provide a
palatable product to be acceptable to children and to help ensure patient compliance. The ADI values
specified by the US FDA and the EFSA for aspartame are 50 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg bodyweight,
respectively. The amount of aspartame contained in the proposed mercaptopurine suspension is less
than 1% of the ADI.

***Raspberry juice***

The concentrated raspberry juice is a well known and natural (non-synthetic) flavour with a high
degree of acceptability.

mercaptopurine can be considered to be 150 mg (for a 60 kg adult and a dose of 2.5 mg/kg

bodyweight per day). Based on estimations from published epidemiological data (assuming a 100%

market share for child and adult ALL) and clinical information, a refined value for market penetration

(Fpen) of 0.0000154 for 6-mercaptopurine in Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories 20 mg/ mL Oral

Suspension has been established.
Using the refined Fpen value of 0.0000154, the PEC SURFACEWATER values for 6 mercaptopurine has been
calculated to be 0.00116 μg/L.
The log partition coefficient in octanol/water (log Kow) values of 6-mercaptopurine is <4.5, such that
this drug substance does not present any hazards with respect to bioaccumulation and persistence.
Therefore, 6-mercaptopurine is not classifiable as a Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT)

substance.
### **2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

The pharmacodynamic properties of mercaptopurine are well-known and there is extensive clinical
experience with the compound. The Applicant provided a literature review of relevant non-clinical data.
This was considered acceptable and the conduct of additional animal studies, including secondary
pharmacology, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic interaction studies was not considered
necessary, as it would not add significantly to the existing knowledge. In terms of safety pharmacology
it should be noted that mercaptopurine is not associated with obvious adverse effects on behaviour,
respiratory or cardiovascular endpoints in clinical use.

Data on the pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine are limited but due to the extensive clinical
experience with mercaptopurine, the metabolism in humans is well understood.

Overall, the toxicity profile is as expected for this class of compounds. Literature data published mostly
in 1953 and 1954 have shown that there are no acute toxicities shown with mercaptopurine and that
mortality typically occurs 4-7 days after dosing. In general, disturbances in hematopoietic system, the
gastrointestinal tract, and the liver were common findings in animal species tested (rat, mice, dog and
monkey). Species specific side effects causing mortalities were also seen such as severe respiratory
effects in rats. Additionally myocarditis and pulmonary lesions were reported in rats. Generally,
mortalities occurred at earlier stages (24-48 hours of dosing) in rats when compared to mice in which
mortalities occurred mostly 4-7 days after the dosing. In both dog and monkey, recovery was rapid
upon cessation of dosing with mercaptopurine.

No specific information on non-clinical toxicokinetics from the literature was submitted. The lack of
toxicokinetic information from animal studies is considered acceptable given the extensive clinical

experience with mercaptopurine.

As it has been established that mercaptopurine is genotoxic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction,
the safety concerns towards mercaptopurine have already been identified and thus no additional
testing in this regard is warranted.

As would be expected with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic and in common with other antimetabolites,
mercaptopurine is mutagenic and causes chromosomal aberrations *in vitro* and *in vivo* in mice and rats.
Increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of leukaemic
patients, in a renal cell carcinoma patient who received an unstated dose of 6–mercaptopurine and in
patients with chronic renal disease treated at doses of 0.4 – 1.0 mg/kg/day.

A 2 year oral (dietary) carcinogenicity study in rat showed positive trends towards a higher incidence
of certain tumours such as C-cell tumors, pheochromocytomas, uterine adenocarcinomas and gliomas,

and the incidences of C-cell tumors and pheochromocytomas in the highest dose group were

significantly higher than the values in the respective control group. In addition, the total numbers of
malignant tumors increased significantly in the female in the high dose group. Most of the tumors
showing high incidence in this study are frequently observed as spontaneous lesions in this strain of
rats, however the study is of insufficient quality to allow for an adequate assessment. Nevertheless,
due to the clear genotoxic potential of mercaptopurine shown both in-vitro and in-vivo, the
carcinogenic potential of mercaptopurine cannot be excluded. This is adequately expressed in sections
4.4 and 5.3 of the SPC.

6-MP, in common with other cytotoxics, has shown to be teratogenic in experimental animals at doses

similar or greater than those used therapeutically in humans. Increased frequencies of fetal death,

central nervous system, facial and limb anomalies were observed among offsprings of mice, rats and
rabbits treated at various times during organogenesis. In all species, the degree of embryotoxicity and
the type of malformations are dependent on the dose and stage of gestation at the time of
administration. In addition to a direct lethal effect on foetuses, mercaptopurine affected the ability of
surviving female foetuses to reproduce upon reaching maturity and malformations in the second and
third generation of offspring were reported. Mercaptopurine did not affect the viability of differentiated
spermatogonia and stem cells in the mouse but did produce some large round spermatids (presumed
to be diploid) and a high frequency of abnormally shaped elongated spermatids. The text in section 4.6
and relevant instructions in the package leaflet adequately reflect this information.

No juvenile toxicology studies have been conducted but the clinical experience in this regard is
considered sufficient.

The local skin irritation properties of mercaptopurine were studied as part of a transdermal drug
delivery system. This study is however not relevant for the current application.

No non-clinical studies have been conducted to assess oropharyngeal toxicity. Given the long history of
use of mercaptopurine and the extensive clinical database, the Applicant considers that the non-clinical
assessment of local tolerance is unnecessary.

Oropharyngeal mucositis is considered unlikely to be influenced by local exposure to mercaptopurine,
but will be influenced by systemic levels of TGN, the active metabolite.

Mercaptopurine has been tested for skin irritation in mouse and human with 23 hour exposure per day

for 21 days and shown to be non-irritant.

According to the CHMP Scientific Advice given, data on local tolerance of the new formulation in an
adequate animal study would be considered of relevance since the surface of oral, pharyngeal and

oesophageal mucosa and peri-oral skin (due to accidental spilling) exposed to dissolved drug is

expected to be considerably higher after intake of a liquid formulation than after intake of a tablet.
Since these data were insufficient this issue is addressed in the clinical section.

Scientific advice has been sought by the Applicant as to whether there is a need for non-clinical
pharmacology or toxicology studies in relation to the excipients intended to be used in the ‘to be
marketed’ formulation. The CHMP advised that the necessity of any excipient used in the formulation
has to be demonstrated and the content of all excipients should be restricted to a minimum without
affecting the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug product. The discussion can be based on thorough

literature research, considerations of the long term administration of the proposed drug product and

special emphasis on the intended use in children undergoing chemotherapy. The CHMP also advised
the applicant to discuss risk associated with the use of the preservatives propyl parahydroxybenzoate
and methyl parahydroxybenzoate at the proposed long term treatment in accordance with the
Guideline on “Excipients in the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use”.

All of the excipients in the liquid formulation of mercaptopurine are considered known and commonly
included as food additives and/or as ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations and not associated
with toxicity, including any local tolerance effects. However, the choice of preservatives as esters of *p* hydroxybenzoic acids (parabens), perhaps especially propylhydroxybenzoate (propylparaben) in the
paediatric populations is generally questioned.

Parabens are known to have oestrogenic activity (EFSA scientific opinion 2004), and published
available toxicological information showed uncertainties regarding parabens as food additives. The
conclusion from the expert panel was that dietary administration of propyl paraben (propyl
hydrobenzoate) induced adverse effects (sperm cells, impaired spermatogenesis, and reduced
testosterone) in male rats at dose levels of 10 mg/kg/day. No ADI could be recommended for propyl
paraben because of the lack of a clear NOAEL. The NOAEL for methyl and ethyl paraben was

considered to be 1000 mg/kg/day.

Generally, the use of propyl hydrobenzoate in pharmaceuticals for the paediatric population should be
avoided because of its endocrine disrupting properties. However, the level of propyl hydrobenzoate

exposure for patients treated with Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories is calculated by the Applicant to

be less than 0.25% of the LOAEL which is considered to be low. The applicant has acknowledged the
recommendations of the CHMP to minimize or eliminate the content of higher esters of
hydroxybenzoate in Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories. If required, a revised formulation will be
introduced by variation of the marketing authorization.

The content of aspartame in the liquid formulation of mercaptopurine is low and at the typical doses
prescribed for ALL will be less than 1% of the accepted daily intake (ADI). This is acceptable and in line
with the CHMP Scientific advice given.

The estimated UVmax for mercaptopurine seems to be 328nm and biodistribution studies in the

pigmented tissues are lacking. Normally, in these situations the lack of phototoxicity studies should be
justified but due to the extensive clinical experience with mercaptopurine the lack of photoxicity
studies is considered acceptable.

In order to evaluate the potential environmental risk in the EU resulting from the use of 6mercaptopurine monohydrate in Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories 20 mg/ mL Oral Suspension, an
environmental risk assessment has been performed and submitted.
Based on estimations from published epidemiological data (assuming a 100% market share for child
and adult ALL) and clinical information, a refined value for market penetration (Fpen) of 0.0000154 for
6-mercaptopurine in Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories 20 mg/ mL Oral Suspension has been
established. This value is considerably lower than the default value of 0.01 in the CHMP Guideline on
the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report

01 June 2006). Using the refined Fpen value of 0.0000154, the PEC SURFACEWATER [ values for ]
6-mercaptopurine has been calculated to be 0.00116 μg/L. This value is nearly 10 times lower than the
action limit of 0.01μg/L. Therefore, Phase II environmental fate and effects assessments were not
considered necessary, which is acceptable and in line with the aforementioned guideline.
In conclusion, mercaptopurine is of negligible risk to the environment from the use of Mercaptopurine
Nova Laboratories 20 mg/ mL Oral Suspension for the treatment of ALL, when used in accordance with
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the Package Leaflet.
### **2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

6-MP has now been used clinically for over 50 years. During this period, many thousands of children

with ALL, throughout the world, have been administered 6-MP as part of a chemotherapy regimen. A
great deal of understanding of the pharmacology and toxicology of the compound has therefore been
acquired. No new preclinical data has been submitted for this new formulation of mercaptopurine and

the literature data summarised by the applicant is considered sufficient.

### **2.3.8. Recommendation fo**

### **r future pre-clinical development **


A dis scussed in section 2.3.6. above, the use of parabens as excipients should be avoided.
The CHMP recommended to the Applicant to investigate the possibility to eliminate propylparahydroxybenzoate from the formulation.
### ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction **

This is an application for oral suspension containing mercaptopurine. To support the marketing
authorisation application the applicant submitted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design
under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment.

The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as
well as efficacy and safety of mercaptopurine based on published literature.

Formal scientific advice was given on clinical aspects by the CHMP for this medicinal product. The
submission of only bioequivalence data to support the clinical aspects of this application is in line with
this Scientific Advice. For the clinical assessment, the *Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence*
*(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1* ) in its current version is of particular relevance.

In certain EU countries such as the UK, manufacturers of so called ‘specials’ have provided unlicensed
liquid formulations of 6-MP for some time, including the currently applied formulation of
Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories. ***GCP ***

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The bioequivalence clinical study was performed at AddClin Research (Pty) Ltd., Pretoria, South Africa.
The study was monitored by Shandon Clinical Trials Ltd, Cork Ireland. The applicant has provided a
statement to the effect that the study was conducted in accordance with South African law, the
European Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC), the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
(CPMP/ICH/135/95, January 17, 1997) and the Declaration of Helsinki Directive 2001/20/EC.

of South Africa (MCC) in November 2005, November 2007 and on 21 - 23 July 2010 (Pending).

Shandon Clinical Trials has been audited by the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) most recently in 2004

(GCP), 2007 (GMP) and 2010 (GCP).

*Internal audits* : The study report informs that on behalf of Nova Laboratories Ltd a GLP compliance
audit on 18 Aug, 2009 was performed by Triclinium (a private CRO) at the analytical laboratory (GBN
Analytics – division of Parexel (Pty) Ltd., South Africa). Pre-study audits for GCP compliance were
performed by Shandon Clinical Trials (accompanied by the Nova Laboratories representative) at
AddClin Research (Aug 4-5, 2009) and at Parexel (Pty) Ltd. (Aug 7, 2009). Triclinium performed

various monitoring visits at AddClin during the course of the clinical phase of the study. The statistics

were quality assured by the Shandon Clinical Trials Ltd. Quality Assurance unit, which also checked the
study final report according to ICH GCP.
### **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

The pharmacokinetic properties of 6-mercaptopurine tablet formulation are well known out of the

experience with Puri-Nethol 50 mg tablets and are summarised below. A bioequivalence study

intended to bridge the existing data with the new liquid formulation was submitted as a basis for this
application. ***Absorption***

About 50% of an oral dose of 6-MP is suggested to be absorbed from the GI tract. However, the
absolute oral bioavailability is lower due to high first-pass metabolism, which is also subject to large
inter-individual variation. A mean oral bioavailability of 16% has been reported in children, with a
range from 5 to 37%. The mean Tmax is 2.2 hours with a range of 0.5 to 4 hours.

6-MP disappears rapidly from plasma, with t 1/2 values of 20 to 90 minutes reported after intravenous
administration. Generally, no parent compound is detected in plasma 8 hr after dose. However, 6-MP is
activated intra-cellularly by conversion to cytotoxic ribonucleotide derivates, which have a longer halflife (approximately 5 hours).

In the liver, mercaptopurin is rapidly and extensively metabolised by methylation and oxidation as well
as the formation of inorganic sulfates. S-metylated metabolites are formed via tiopurine
methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity is highly variable in patients due to genetic polymorphism. In

a Caucasian population approximately 89% have normal enzyme activity, 11% intermediate activity

and 0.3% low or non-detectable activity. On chronic dosing, low TPMT activity leads to a high
accumulation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides in erythrocytes, which has been associated with
myelosuppression. The inactive metabolite 6-thio uric acid is formed via xanthine oxidase and is
excreted in urine. About 7% of an oral dose has been reported to occur as unchanged parent
compound in urine within 12 hours.
The absolute oral bioavailability is low due to high first-pass metabolism, which is also subject to large
inter-individual variation. A mean oral bioavailability of 16% has been reported in children, with a
range from 5 to 37%. The mean Tmax is 2.2 hours with a range of 0.5 to 4 hours.

The Stockley’s drug interaction database reports three food interaction studies in children. In one study,

administration of mercaptopurine 15 minutes after a standard breakfast including milk delayed Tmax
and reduced the AUC and Cmax by 26% and 36%, respectively. However, in another study a high
inter-individual variation was seen, but no clear effect of a breakfast consisting of milk or yoghurt,
cereal and sandwiches, on mercaptopurin bioavailability. Yet another study showed a not statistically
significant decrease in AUC and/or Cmax by 20-22% after a standardised breakfast, again with a wide
inter-individual variation. *In vitro* data indicate that mercaptopurine is catabolised in cow’s milk,
suggested due to the presence of the mercaptopurine-metabolising enzyme xanthine oxidase which is
present in milk.

The Applicant presented a case report (Sofianou-Katsoulis *et al*, 2006) of a patient who during the
maintenance phase had elevated peripheral blood counts despite increasing the 6-MP dose to 160% of
the calculated dosage for his body surface area (BSA). It was found out that the boy routinely took the

chemotherapy with cow’s milk. After changing to water, the 6-MP dose could be reduced to the normal
dose (100% of the calculated dose for his BSA). The authors suggest that the reduced bioavailability of
6-MP at administration with cow’s milk could be due to the high content of xanthine oxidase in 6-MP.
Rivard *et al*, 1989, showed that incubation of 6-MP with pasteurised cow’s milk at 37 º C for 30 minutes
resulted in 30% catabolism of 6-MP. There was no effect if the milk was boiled for 5 minutes. In a
study in 17 children with ALL, Riccardi *et al*, 1986, demonstrated that administration of 6-MP with a
breakfast, including 250 ml milk, reduced AUC by about 27%. In a study by Lonnerholm *et al*, 1989,

on the other hand, there was no difference in the mean bioavailability of 6-MP when taken with
breakfast compared with the fasted state (mean ratio 1.03) but the individual fed/fasted ratios varied
considerably, between 0.33 and 1.81.
### **Bioequivalence **

**Clinical bioequivalence study (SC02808)**

In support of the application, one original clinical study report has been submitted. The primary
objective of the study was “to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics and compare the
bioavailability of a Test formulation (Mercaptopurine Oral Suspension 100 mg/5 ml) and the marketed
Reference formulation (Puri-Nethol 50 mg Tablet) using a single-dose, randomised, two-period
crossover design”.

**Methods**

*Study design*

The study was a randomised, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence single-dose crossover study
conducted in 60 male, healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. After an overnight fast, subjects
were dosed with either one 50 mg Puri-Nethol tablet (reference) or 2.5 ml of the 6-MP oral suspension

20 mg/mL(test). Subjects were not served any food until 4.5 hours after the dose. Blood-samples were

collected pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.33, 1.67, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 and
12.0 hours after drug administration. The study periods were separated by a wash-out period of at
least 72 hours. The clinical part of the study was conducted between Sept 25 and Oct 7, 2009, at
AddClin Research (Pty) Ltd., Pretoria, South Africa. The study was monitored by Shandon Clinical
Trials Ltd, Cork Ireland. The study was sponsored by Nova laboratories Ltd. The analytical part of the

study was conducted between Nov 25 and Dec 7, 2009, at Parexel Bioanalytical Services Division,

Mosselbay, South Africa.

*Test and reference products*

*Test product:* Mercaptopurine oral suspension, 100 mg/5ml, manufactured by Nova Laboratories Ltd.

Leicester, UK, batch No. 0790W001, expiry date: Oct 6, 2009.

*Reference product:* Puri-Nethol, 50 mg tablet, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, UK, batch No.
902797, expiry date: Dec 31, 2013.

*Population studied*

The study was conducted in healthy, male volunteers. A total of 60 adult healthy volunteers were to be
enrolled. Dropouts were to be replaced if the number of subjects completing the study would
otherwise be less than 60. However, there were no drop-outs and all 60 subjects completed both study
periods and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.

*Analytical methods*

Plasma samples were stored at -70ºC in the clinic until shipped to the analytical laboratory. Plasma
concentrations of mercaptopurine were determined with a validated LC/MS/MS method. 6-thioguanine
was used as internal standard. Altogether, 1920 plasma samples from 60 volunteers were analysed.

*Pre-study validation*
The validation range for mercaptopurine was 0.508 - 128 ng/ml for 6-mercaptopurine. The lowest
recorded concentration of mercaptopurine was 0.5 ng/mL and the highest was 255 ng/mL. A dilution
test showed that concentrations of up to 205 ng/ml of 6-mercaptopurine in plasma could be analysed
reliably when diluted into the calibration range. High variability of analyte peak areas was observed in
the presence of haemolysed blood (1 %). The internal standard provided sufficient compensation so
that the precision of the peak area ratios was well within acceptance criteria.

Specificity was shown employing 6 independent sources of human plasma. Sensitivity at the limit of
quantification, 0.508 ng/ml, was shown. Satisfactory between- and within-run accuracy and precision
was shown for low, medium and high QC sample concentrations. Dilution integrity was demonstrated.
Stability in plasma was demonstrated for 6 h at room temperature, and over 3 freeze-thaw cycles.

*Within-study validation*
The assay method was subject to partial re-instatement validation in connection with analysis of study

samples. The validation range for mercaptopurine was 0.497 ng/ml - 130 ng/ml. Specificity was

demonstrated in blank plasma from six sources. Recovery was 87%, 86% and 84% for high, medium

and low QC samples, respectively. Satisfactory method performance during study sample analysis was

demonstrated. Appropriate batch acceptance criteria were used. Repeated analysis was adequately
justified.

ntal methods. The


The statistical analysis was performed at Shandon Clinical Trials Ltd. To compare the pharmacokinetics

of the two products, ANOVA was used on log-transformed AUC 0-t, AUC 0-, and C max and 90%

confidence interval for the test/reference ratio were calculated. The protocol stated that the oral
suspension and the tablet were to be concluded bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals for the
test/reference ratio of the population geometric means fell within 80-125% for AUC 0-t [ and C] max [. ]


**Results**

The pharmac


okinetic results of the study are presented in Table 4and Figure 1below.


The extent of exposure (AUC) and the peak concentration (Cmax) were approximately 13% and 40%

higher, respectively, for the oral suspension than for the tablet. The absorption rate was higher for the

suspension, with a point estimate for Tmax ratio (suspension vs. tablet) of 0.48 (90% CI:s 0.28-0.61).

The inter-subject variability was lower for the suspension (treatment A) than for the tablet (treatment
B), as can be seen in Table 5. More specifically, the inter-individual CVs for AUC were 30% and 39%
for the suspension and for the tablet, respectively. The inter-subject variation in Cmax was 46% for

the suspension and 69% for the tablet. Also the Cmax range was narrower for the suspension, 37.7 212 ng/ml vs. 6.72 - 255 ng/ml for the tablet. As a result, the lowest as well as the highest Cmax

detected was for the tablet (Figure 2a and b).

### ***Elimination ***

6-MP disappears rapidly from plasma, with t 1/2 values of 20 to 90 minutes reported after intravenous
administration. Generally, no parent compound is detected in plasma 8 hr after dose. However, 6-MP is
activated intra-cellularly by conversion to cytotoxic ribonucleotide derivates, which have a longer halflife (approximately 5 hours). The active 6-MP ribonucleotides are formed via hypoxantin guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase in a step-wise process. 6-MP ribonucleotide inhibits purine nucleotide
synthesis and metabolism which in turn alters the synthesis and function of RNA and DNA.

In the liver, mercaptopurine is rapidly and extensively metabolised by methylation and oxidation as
well as the formation of inorganic sulfates. S-metylated metabolites are formed via tiopurine
methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity is highly variable in patients due to genetic polymorphism. In
a Caucasian population, approximately 89% have normal enzyme activity, 11% intermediate activity
and 0.3% low or non-detectable activity. On chronic dosing, low TPMT activity leads to a high

accumulation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides in erythrocytes, which has been associated with
myelosuppression. The inactive metabolite 6-thio uric acid is formed via xanthine oxidase and is

excreted in urine. About 7% of an oral dose has been reported to occur as unchanged parent
compound in urine within 12 hours.

### ***Special pop***

There are no specific studies on the pharmacokinetics or safety of 6-MP in patients with renal or
hepatic impairment.
### **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics **


No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented (see discussion on clinical pharm

acology).


The pharmacological profile of 6-mercaptopurine is well known. The bioavailability of oral 6–
mercaptopurine shows considerable inter-individual variability, which probably results from its firstpass metabolism. When administered orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m [2 ] to 7 paediatric patients, the
bioavailability averaged 16% of the administered dose, with a range of 5 to 37%.

Data on the effect of food on mercaptopurine bioavailability appears to be inconsistent and based on

the variability observed (in published literature data) it is suggested that the main concern might be

milk products, since these contain xanthine oxidase. Although, based on the presented data, it might
be difficult to discern the effect of food in general from the effect of milk, recommendations to avoid
concomitant intake of milk products were included in the product information. Since drug
administration in the fasted state may be difficult, especially in small children, appropriate
recommendation that for the individual patient, administration should be standardised with regard to
concomitant food, but that concomitant milk products should be avoided is included in the SPC. This is
considered adequate, given that the dose will be individually titrated based on haematological response.

Given the divergent results of food interaction studies, and that administration in the fasted state
might be difficult, especially in small children, the following recommendations have been introduced in
the Summary of product Characteristics and reflected in the Package Leaflet:

Section 4.2:
*Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but patients*

*should standardise the method of administration. The dose should not be taken with milk or dairy*

*products (see section 4.5). Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories should be taken at least 1 hour before*
*or 2 hours after milk or dairy products.*

Section 4.5 :
*The administration of 6–mercaptopurine with food may decrease systemic exposure slightly but this is*
*unlikely to be of clinical significance. Therefore, Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories may be taken with*
*food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose*
*should not be taken with milk or dairy products since they contain xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which*
*metabolises 6–mercaptopurine and might therefore lead to reduced plasma concentrations of*
*mercaptopurine.*

The available evidence suggests administration of mercaptopurine in the evening results in greater
efficacy and hence reduced risk of relapse, therefore the optimal time of the day for Novapurine intake
is in the evening. The following wording is included in section 4.2:

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report
Page 33


-----

*Mercaptopurine displays diurnal variation in pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Administration in the*
*evening compared to morning administration may lower the risk of relapse. Therefore the daily dose of*
*Novapurine should be taken in the evening*

As there are no specific studies on the pharmacokinetics or safety of 6-MP in patients with renal or

hepatic impairment, the SPC recommends caution in these populations.

The bioequivalence study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Testing of cytotoxic agents in healthy
volunteers is considered problematic from the ethical point of view. The Applicant considered the use
of healthy volunteers as justified since a single dose was administered on two separate occasions only,
while studies in humans and animals have indicated that the effects of 6-MP on the human body are
caused by chronic administration. In childhood and adult leukaemia, doses vary from 1.5 - 5
mg/kg/day (continuously). Thus, in an adult male weighing 70 kg the minimum dose will be 105
mg/day. In this study, volunteers were given a single 1 x 50 mg dose of 6-MP (as an oral suspension
or tablet) at each of the two dosing visits with a washout period of at least 3 days between visits. The
relatively low dose and the dosing schedule was suggested to minimise the risk of any short- or longterm toxicity from two doses of 6-MP. Furthermore, subjects were phenotyped for thiopurine
methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. Only subjects with normal or high enzyme activity were recruited
into this study.

There have been cases where bioequivalence studies have been conducted in healthy volunteers (e.g.
generic versions of 6-MP and azathioprine -a pro-drug of 6-MP tablets) and this approach has been
considered acceptable as part of a Marketing Authorisation application. However, since 6-MP is an antipurine metabolite with a significant toxicity profile, it was appropriate to limit the number of adult
healthy volunteers recruited as part of the bioequivalence study.

The Applicant suggested that use of adult instead of paediatric volunteers was justified since
6-mercatopurine as Puri-Nethol (the reference formulation) is used in both adults and children without
any difference in dosing, which is given on a mg/m [2] basis.

There are no data to suggest that age is likely to influence the performance in vivo of different 6-MP
formulations and hence absorption. A bioequivalence study in children would pose a number of
significant challenges:
- The ALL population is heterogeneous with significant covariates (e.g. co-medications such as
methotrexate) which could influence the rate and extent of 6-MP absorption.

- The dosing is individualised; 6-MP is initiated at a dose of 75mg / m [2] during the continuation phase
of ALL treatment (i.e. according to the child’s body surface area). During the course of therapy, the
dose is individualised for each child according to absolute neutrophil and platelet counts. Thus, the
possibility of recruiting children that are taking a single (or multiples of) 50mg Puri-Nethol tablet(s) will

be extremely limited and present a significant challenge. For the majority of children, the 50mg tablet

is split to achieve as near as possible to the desired dose. As already mentioned in the Section 6, this
can result in administering a dose which varies significantly from that intended and therefore may bias
the trial outcome.
Moreover, it is recognised, that according to “Guideline On The Role Of Pharmacokinetics In The
Development Of Medicinal Products In The Paediatric Population” (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CHMP/EWP/
147013/2004), bioequivalence studies for bridging paediatric clinical documentation between two
formulations should preferably be performed in adults, since the applicant can justify that the study
results can be extrapolated to the paediatric population. Hence the inclusion of healthy volunteers was
considered acceptable provided the risks are acceptable for healthy volunteers.

The results indicated that the extent of exposure (AUC) and the peak concentration (Cmax) were
approximately 13% and 40% higher, respectively, for the oral suspension than for the tablet, although
the 90% confidence interval for the AUC ratio fell within the normally applied limits for concluding
bioequivalence between two products. The absorption rate was clearly higher for the suspension, with
a point estimate for Tmax ratio (suspension vs. tablet) of 0.48 (90% CI:s 0.28-0.61). Cmax is
approximately 40 % higher with the suspension and therefore switch from tablet to liquid should be
done with caution. The following statement is included in section 4.2 of the SmPC:

*Switching between tablet and oral suspension and vice versa*
*A tablet form of 6–mercaptopurine is also available. The 6-mecaptopurine oral suspension and tablet*
*are not bioequivalent with respect to peak plasma concentration, and therefore intensified*
*haematological monitoring of the patient is advised on switching formulations (see section 5.2).*

The difference in pharmacokinetic profile between the suspension and the tablet was described in the
SmPC, section 5.2, as follows:

*‘In a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=60), 50mg* *of Novapurine oral*
*suspension was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 50mg tablet for AUC, but not Cmax.*
*The mean (90% CI) Cmax with the oral suspension was 39 % (22% - 58%) higher than the tablet*
*although there was less between-subject variability (%C.V) with the oral suspension (46%) than the*
*tablet (69%).* ’The elimination half-life of 6–mercaptopurine is 90 ± 30 minutes, but the active
metabolites have a longer half-life (approximately 5 hours) than the parent compound. The apparent
body clearance is 4832 ± 2562 ml/min/m [2] . There is low entry of 6–mercaptopurine into the
cerebrospinal fluid.

The main route of elimination for 6–mercaptopurine is by metabolism. The intracellular anabolism of 6merpactopurine is catalysed by several enzymes to eventually form 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs),
but a variety of intermediary TGNs are formed en route to the TGNs. The first step is catalysed by
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase yielding thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). 6–
mercaptopurine is also subject to S-methylation by the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT),
yielding methylmercaptopurine, which is inactive. However, TPMT also catalyses the S-methylation of
the principle nucleotide metabolite, TIMP, to form methylthioinosine monophosphate (mTIMP). Both
TIMP and mTIMP are inhibitors of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase, an enzyme which is
important in de novo purine synthesis. Xanthine oxidase is the main catabolic enzyme and it converts
the 6–mercaptopurine into the inactive metabolite, 6-thiouric acid. This is excreted in the urine.
Approximately 7% of an oral dose is excreted as unchanged 6–mercaptopurine within 12 hours after
administration.

There are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the TPMT enzyme activity who are very sensitive
to the myelosuppresive effect of 6–mercaptopurine and prone to developing rapid bone marrow
depression following the initiation of treatment with 6–mercaptopurine. This problem could be

exacerbated by coadministration with active substances that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine,

mesalazine or sulfasalazine. Some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency, although these tests
have not been shown to identify all patients at risk of severe toxicity. Therefore close monitoring of
blood counts is necessary. Substantial dose reductions are generally required for homozygous-TPMT
deficiency patients to avoid the development of life threatening bone marrow suppression.

A possible association between decreased TPMT activity and secondary leukaemias and myelodysplasia
has been reported in individuals receiving 6–mercaptopurine in combination with other cytotoxics

In terms of other drug interactions, inhibition of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, when given with
6–mercaptopurine, has been reported. Monitoring of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) value is
recommended during concomitant administration with oral anticoagulants.

Cytotoxic agents may decrease the intestinal absorption of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of the

phenytoin serum levels is recommended. It is possible that the levels of other anti-epileptic medicinal

products may also be altered. Serum antiepileptic levels should be closely monitored during treatment
with Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories, making dose adjustments as necessary.

When allopurinol and Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories are administered concomitantly it is essential
that only a quarter of the usual dose of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories is given since allopurinol

decreases the rate of metabolism of 6–mercaptopurine via xanthine oxidase. Also other xanthine
oxidase inhibitors, such as febuxostat, may decrease the metabolism of mercaptopurine and
concomitant administration is not recommended as data are insufficient to determine an adequate
dose reduction.
### **2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology **

In conclusion, the results of the submitted comparative bioavailability study indicate that the
bioavailability from the suspension is in the same range as for the tablet, since bioequivalence was
demonstrated for AUC, i.e. extent of absorption. The suspension also appears to perform more

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report

-----

predictable than the tablet. The rate of absorption was higher for the suspension than for the tablet,
leading to a higher Cmax.

The pharmacokinetic data are considered sufficient for a new pharmaceutical form.
It is concluded that the pharmacokinetic study shows that the Novapurine oral suspension has reliable
pharmacokinetics. The liquid product should also enable more precise dosing. These two factors
(reliable pharmacokinetics and precise dosing) should facilitate more predictable dosing on an

individual basis.

Pharmacology issues discussed are appropriately reflected in the product information.
### ***2.5. Clinical efficacy ***

No new clinical efficacy data have been submitted. Reference to literature data and experience with the
Puri-Nethol tablet was made. This approach is in compliance with the CHMP Scientific Advice. **2.5.1. Discussion on clinical efficacy  **

The basic approach to ALL therapy consists of a relatively brief remission-induction phase, followed by
intensification (consolidation) treatment and then prolonged maintenance therapy. Although 6-MP may
be administered during intensification (consolidation), its main use is during the continuation phase.
Daily mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate constitutes the basis of most continuation regimens.
This combination given to the limits of tolerance is associated with improved clinical outcome.

Although all children with ALL require prolonged continuation therapy (2 - 2.5 years), the reasons for
this are not well defined. However, decreasing the duration of continuation phase of chemotherapy (to
12 - 18 months) produced worse outcomes (event free survival) overall. While there may be a subgroup of children who do not need prolonged therapy, it is not possible at present to identify them
prospectively.

Since thioguanine is more potent than mercaptopurine in model systems and leads to higher
concentrations of thioguanine nucleotides in cells and cytotoxic concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid
several randomised trials have been done to compare the effectiveness of these two drugs Thioguanine,
given at a daily dose of 40 mg/m² or more, produced superior anti-leukaemic responses to
mercaptopurine but was associated with profound thrombocytopenia, an increased risk of death in
remission, and an unacceptably high rate (10–20%) of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Although the
lower activity of thiopurine methyltransferase is associated with thioguanine-related liver damage, this
measure cannot identify reliably patients at risk 6-MP, therefore, remains the drug of choice for acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia, although thioguanine could still be given in short-term courses during the
intensification phase of treatment.

There is no doubt that 6-MP is considered integral to curing children with ALL. The efficacy of 6-MP for
the treatment of ALL is unquestioned and has been established over many years through a number of
national and international trials aimed at improving outcomes. Furthermore it would be unethical to

conduct any efficacy studies with 6-MP in Europe.

This application is to seek the indication of ALL for an oral 6MP liquid formulation where tablets are the
only available formulation so far. This liquid alternative would allow treating patients (including adults)
in whom tablets are not appropriate due to difficulties in swallowing. More important, it would solve the
problem of dose adaptation in children since the currently available tablets make it necessary to crush
or divide tablets with a risk of dosing error related to imprecision.

6-MP is titrated according to haematological response, usually measured by neutrophil and platelet
counts. Therefore, the reliability of the formulation from a pharmacokinetic point of view is the key
factor in assessing its ability to induce and maintain remission. The use of toxicity as a factor for
determining over-dosing or under-dosing is common practice in cancer cytotoxic therapy as some level

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report

-----

of toxicity is required to achieve the desired anti-cancer effect. The toxicity target is therefore more
important than the actual dose given. With a liquid formulation an exact measure of fluid
corresponding to the dose required is possible.

In this application no further clinical efficacy studies were provided with 6-mercaptopurine because
there is enough clinical experience from currently available data. In addition, oral 6-MP in the tablet
form (Puri-Nethol) is already licensed in the EU for the treatment of ALL in Children.

The CHMP put special emphasis on the acceptability of the liquid formulation to the paediatric patients.
At the request of the CHMP the Applicant collected all data currently available in the EU from use of the
proposed oral suspension to provide reassurance that the formulation is accepted by children in terms
of palatability which may have implications on compliance (and thereby efficacy).

Data from the availability of the product through continuous supply of the product as a ‘Special’ to the
UK market (unlicensed medicine manufactured for individual patients under the MHRA Specials License)
were presented. The Applicant claimed that the palatability and acceptability of Novapurine suspension
to children has been demonstrated since there have been no complaints. However, the fact that no
complaints have been registered from patients administered with Novapurine as a ‘Special’ is not
sufficient to provide reassurance on Novapurine palatability since this investigation was not planned a
priori.

The Applicant has conducted a questionnaire based survey to obtain feedback on the ‘collective
experience’ of the hospital pharmacists, nurses and patients as to the acceptability / palatability of the
formulation. The responses were from pharmacists (6), nurses (2) and a combination of pharmacist /
nurse (2). The majority (8/10) of respondents stated that Nova’s oral mercaptopurine suspension was
dispensed for children only in their hospital; in two hospitals it was also dispensed for adults. This

survey revealed the acceptability/palatability of the product in the paediatric population.

In addition, palatability of Novapurine was assessed in adults (n=6), on a 7-point scale for bitterness,
sweetness, sourness, saltiness. It reveals that the product maintains acceptable palatability throughout
its proposed shelf life (0, 6 months, 12 months).
The survey on children was limited to 10 participants (pharmacists, nurses) who relay the children’s
feeling regarding palatability. This information should have been retrieved from either patients
themselves (if age permits) or their carers (parents).

Following CHMP recommendation the applicant proposed to conduct a study to investigate the
palatability of the product, in the context of a prospective, open-label, single dose, non-randomised,

questionnaire-based survey in children (aged 3-16 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The
palatability tool for assessing the end points can be chosen following a thorough literature review, but

is likely to be based on visual analogue/verbal scales. It is anticipated that young children as well as
adolescents will be recruited from leukaemia centres in the UK. A full protocol will be discussed with
the CHMP before a study is initiated.
### **2.5.2. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy **

In this application no further clinical efficacy studies were provided with 6-mercaptopurine because
there is enough clinical experience from currently available data since oral 6-MP in the tablet form

(Puri-Nethol) is already licensed in the EU for the treatment of ALL. This is in line with Scientific Advice
given to the Applicant.
At the request of the CHMP the Applicant collected all data currently available in the EU from use of the
proposed oral suspension to provide reassurance that the formulation is accepted by children in terms
of palatability. This may have implications on compliance (and thereby efficacy) and reassurance is
needed that compliance is not lower than it is for the tablet.

The bioequivalence study suggested that the two products have similar bioavailability (AUC) but that
absorption was more rapid from the suspension, with a considerably higher Cmax. Given that the 6-MP
dose is always individually titrated based on haematological response/toxicity, and since toxicity is
coupled to the pharmacological action of 6-MP, it is agreed that additional clinical data to confirm
efficacy of the oral suspension are not considered necessary, despite the difference in rate of

-----

absorption compared with the tablet. In this respect, the liquid formulation is suitable even for minimal

dose adjustments. However, it should be confirmed that the formulation is acceptable to children.
### **2.5.3. Recommendations for future clinical efficacy development **

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

- The Applicant should investigate the palatability of the product, in the context of a prospective,
open-label, single dose, non-randomised, questionnaire-based survey in children (aged 3-16 years)

with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The palatability tool for assessing the end points can be
chosen following a thorough literature review, but is likely to be based on visual analogue/verbal

scales. It is anticipated that young children as well as adolescents will be recruited from leukaemia

centres in the UK. A full protocol will be discussed with the CHMP before a study is initiated. ***2.6. Clinical safety ***

In this application, limited further clinical safety data with 6-mercaptopurine were provided, because
there is adequate clinical experience from currently available data. This is in line with the CHMP

Scientific advice given on clinical aspects of this application. Limited additional safety data were

derived from the previously described bioequivalence study.

60 adult healthy volunteers were included in this study. The Mean age was 22.98 years. Data for all 60
volunteers entered for the study were included in the safety evaluation.

In each of the two study periods, one of the following treatments was administered orally:
Treatment A: 2.5 ml Mercaptopurine 20 mg/mLOral Suspension
Nova Laboratories Ltd., Leicester, UK.
Treatment B: 1 x Puri-Nethol ® 50 mg tablet,
GlaxoSmithKline, UK.
Volunteers were given a single 1 x 50 mg dose of 6-MP (as an oral suspension or tablet) at each of the
two dosing visits with a washout period of at least 3 days between visits.
In the bioequivalence study, three adverse events were recorded in three volunteers. One volunteer
treated by Mercaptopurine 20 mg/mLOral Suspension had a headache three hours thirty minutes after
dosing in Period 2. Two volunteers treated by Puri-Nethol 50 mg tablet had out-of-range blood test
results at post study. The case of headache was treated with an icepack. The out-of-range blood tests
were repeated, with satisfactory results.

There were no deaths, serious adverse events or significant adverse events.

At pre-study screening 52 volunteers had one or more biochemistry/haematology results slightly

outside the laboratory ranges. Ten subjects had a slightly raised total bilirubin pre-study. These total
bilirubin increased were not associated with elevated AST or alkaline phosphatase. Post study, 50
volunteers had one or more biochemistry/haematology results slightly outside the laboratory ranges.
None of the post study out-of-range results were considered by the Investigator to be clinically
significant, with the exception of two possible related events of moderate intensity of reversible
elevated AST (>5 x ULN at maximum intensity) in one subject and reversible leucopenia with
neutropenia (Grade 1 CTCAE v4). These two volunteers had received the tablet formulation as their
second treatment. Repeat tests were carried out for these volunteers, with satisfactory results.

Elevated AST (>5 x ULN at maximum intensity) and reversible leucopenia with neutropenia (Grade 1
CTCAE v4) are two adverse events included in 4.8 section of Puri-Nethol.

**Post marketing experience**

The issue of local tolerance has been investigated in the pharmacovigilance database of the recent
UKALL2003 trial. This is an academic trial comparing the efficacy of different combinatons of
chemotherapy for ALL and employs mercaptopurine in the form of both tablet oral suspension. The
Applicant was the principle supplier of oral mercaptopurine suspension to the trial until 2008, and
afterwards remained one of two suppliers. Data on the incidence of stomatitis were analysed by the

trial statistician at the Applicant’s request and they are presented in the following table.

**Table 6: Incidence of stomatitis in the UKALL 2003**
### **2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety **

The safety profile is of 6 MP is well known and derives from 50 years-clinical use. The major doserelated toxicities of 6-MP (de Vita et al, 2005) are myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Gastrointestinal toxicities include nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, and stomatitis.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are maximal 7 days after treatment. Anaemia is observed less
frequently. Full haematologic recovery usually occurs after 14 days. Careful monitoring of
haematological parameters should be conducted during therapy. The leucocyte and platelet counts
continue to fall after treatment is stopped, so at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in the counts,
treatment should be interrupted immediately. Bone marrow suppression is reversible if 6–
mercaptopurine is withdrawn early enough. In TPMT-deficient patients, dosage reduction to 5% to 25%
of the standard dosage (75 mg/m [2] /d) is necessary to prevent excessive toxicity (see also discussion on
clinical pharmacology).
Finally, due to myelosuppression, the concomitant use of mercaptopurine with yellow fever vaccine is
contraindicated. Moreover, immunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause
infection in immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not
recommended.
6-MP is hepatotoxic and hepatotoxicity occurs in up to 30% of adult patients and is manifested mainly
as cholestatic jaundice, although elevations of hepatic transaminases may also be seen. Hepatotoxicity
is usually mild and reversible after discontinuation of 6-MP, but frank hepatic necrosis can occur after
high doses of the drug. Combinations of 6-MP with other known hepatotoxic agents should be avoided,
and liver function test results should be closely monitored. The mechanism of liver toxicity is not
known but may relate to the cytochrome P-450–dependent metabolism of 6-MP to a hepatotoxic
metabolite or accumulation of 6-MP metabolites in the liver. Liver function tests should be monitored

weekly during treatment. More frequent monitoring may be advisable in those with pre-existing liver
disease or receiving other potentially hepatotoxic therapy. The patient should be instructed to
discontinue Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories immediately if jaundice becomes apparent
Similarly, during remission induction when rapid cell lysis is occurring, uric acid levels in blood and
urine should be monitored as hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria may develop, with the risk of uric
acid nephropathy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation may minimize potential renal complications.
Pancreatitis has been reported to occur at a frequency of ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 (“common”) in patients
treated for inflammatory bowel disease.
One bioequivalence study to bridge the existing knowledge with the new formulation was submitted.
Only three adverse events were collected from the bioequivalence study: Headache, elevated AST and
leucopenia with neutropenia and these are in line with the known adverse event profile of
mercaptopurine.

Since treatment with mercaptopurine per se is associated with toxicity on the oropharyngeal mucosa,
potential additional adverse effects caused by topical exposure were discussed as it was questioned
whether the pharmaceutical formulation may promote or worsen the potential risk of oral mucositis.

The Applicant was asked to collect all data currently available in the EU from use of the proposed oral
suspension to provide reassurance on the local tolerance of mercaptopurine oral suspension with
special attention to chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. The issue of local toleranc e has been

investigated through the pharmacovigilance database of the recent UKALL2003 trial. The analysis was
conducted by the UKALL2003 trial statistician and at the request of Nova Laboratories.
Although a specific evaluation of the effect of oral mercaptopurine formulations (tablet versus
suspension) on rates of local toxicity was not an *a priori* objective of UKALL2003, toxicity data collected
thus far in excess of 2000 children suggests that potential differences in local exposure to
mercaptopurine as a consequence of formulation does not appear to have an effect on the rates of
stomatitis, which overall are very low during the maintenance phase. This data was also presented to
the PDCO during the PIP application, who consequently waived the need for further evaluation of local
tolerance in their final opinion.

The rates of stomatitis are very low (0.2– 0.3%) in all age categories during the maintenance phase of

therapy, where mercaptopurine is predominantly administered. The total rates of stomatitis are higher
in children over 10 years old, than in children under 5 years old or those aged between 5-10 years.
This is not surprising since it is known that incidence of all toxicity is higher in adolescent leukaemic
subjects.

The data on local tolerance are also supported by the known pharmacology of mercaptopurine. The
anti-proliferative and cytotoxic pharmacology of mercaptopurine requires systemic absorption and
activation to thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) which are principally formed following first pass

metabolism in the liver. Oro-pharyngeal toxicity is therefore influenced by systemic exposure and not

local exposure and any theoretical local (epithelial) activation of mercaptopurine will be minimal and
insignificant relative to the overwhelming levels of circulating TGNs following liver activation (first
pass) of an oral dose.

Mercaptopurine Nonva Laboratories contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine and it may
be harmful for people with phenylketonuria.

It also contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoates which may cause
allergic reaction (possibly delayed).

As this medicine contains sucrose, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance,
glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.
Long term use increases the risk of dental caries and it is essential that adequate dental hygiene is
maintained.

Gastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia may be early symptoms of
overdose having occurred. The principal toxic effect is on the bone marrow, resulting in
myelosuppression. Haematological toxicity is likely to be more profound with chronic overdose than
with a single ingestion of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories. Liver dysfunction and gastroenteritis may
also occur. The risk of overdose is also increased when xanthine oxidase inhibitors is being given
concomitantly with 6–mercaptopurine.

As there is no known antidote the blood picture should be closely monitored and general supportive
measures, together with appropriate blood transfusion, instituted if necessary. Active measures (such

as the use of activated charcoal or gastric lavage) may not be effective in the event of
6-mercaptopurine overdose unless the procedure can be undertaken within 60 minutes of ingestion.

Parents and care givers should avoid Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories contact with skin or mucous
membrane. If the suspension comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it should be washed
immediately and thoroughly with soap and water.

6MP oral suspension has been developed for children who cannot swallow or for whom precise dosing
cannot be achieved by splitting tablets, meaning 3-6 years-old, less than 50 kgs children.
Considering that the weight range for children will be [10-50] kgs, with a 100 mg/5ml concentration
and a 2.5 mg/kg posology, the volume administered ranges from 1.25 to 6.5 ml. The applicant has
demonstrated precise measurement of the administered volume by the syringes provided. It is agreed

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories
CHMP assessment report
Page 40


-----

that for doses above 1 ml, 0.2 ml increments will provide sufficient precision in dosage, given the
overall pharmacokinetic variability.

As 2 syringes are included in the pack, a risk of dosing error cannot be excluded. Adequate precautions
and instructions have been included in the Product Information. So far no such errors have occurred
from the availability of the product as ’special’ in a number of EU member states. Furthermore, the 1
ml and 5 ml syringes will be provided in different colours. The plunger in the 1 ml syringe will be
‘purple’ in colour, and in the 5 ml syringe it will be ‘white’ in colour. This will ensure that the two
syringes are clearly distinguishable. The proposed syringes will be available at product launch following
MA approval. Surveillance of medication errors as a consequence of syringe confusion are part of the
PV strategy.

At the recommendation of the CHMP, the applicant agreed to add overpacks for each syringe on which

‘dose less than 1 mL’ will be printed on the 1 mL syringe and ‘dose more than 1 mL’ " will be printed
on the 5 mL syringe to clarify to the patient or the caregiver which devices is appropriate for the
desired volume to be drawn into the syringe.
### **2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety **

The safety profile of 6 MP derives from 50 years-clinical use. The most frequent adverse reactions

include stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding,

hepatotoxicity, bone marrow toxicity and immune suppression.

Based on the pharmacology of 6-mercaptopurine, it is considered unlikely that local exposure would
significantly contribute to oro-pharyngeal toxicity. It is suggested that any signals relating to local

toxicity issues are handled within the PSUR framework.

The potential risk of dosing is addressed with appropriate instructions and warnings in the product

information. Routine Pharmacovigilance strategy will be sensitive to such dosing errors, such as or

example, surveillance of medication errors as a consequence of syringe confusion is part of the PV
strategy. **2.6.3. Recommendations for future clinical safety development **

Furthermore, the CHMP recommends to the Applicant to add overpacks for each syringe on which the

text "dose less than 1 ml" would be printed on the 1 ml syringe and "dose more than 1 ml" would be

printed on the 5 ml syringe. This will explain the patient or the caregiver which device is adapted to
the volume and should be used for withdrawing the liquid. ***2.7 Pharmacovigilance *** **Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system **

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the
legislative requirements. **Risk Management plan **

The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because it is accepted that
risk management plans are generally not required for hybrid products where the active substance has
been on the market for a long time, unless a safety concern requiring additional risk minimisation
activities has been identified with the reference product. This argument is considered relevant for the
substance itself.

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories

As the product is intended for self- (or parent-) administration outside of a hospital setting, risks
associated with handling and dosing have been addressed by adequate instructions in the Package
Leaflet.

Surveillance of medication errors as a consequence of confusion with the use of syringes is part of the

routine Pharmacovigilance strategy.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance

was adequate to monitor the safety of the product.

No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product

information.
### ***2.8 User consultation ***

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the

ap licant show that the package lep aflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the *Guideline on*

*the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.*
## **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **
### ***Benefits *** **Beneficial effects **

6-MP remains an integral part of ALL treatment protocols in children. So far, the only licensed product

on the EU market is a 50 mg tablet, which should not be divided, but in practice this has to be done in

order to find an appropriate dose for the individual patient.

During therapy of ALL, the dose of 6-MP is individualised, essentially based on haematologic toxicity.
Compared with tablets, which is the only currently available licensed formulation, an oral suspension

provides better accuracy and ease of administration in small children. From an efficacy as well as
safety perspective this is favourable.

### **Uncertainty in th**

### **e knowledge about the beneficial effects. **


Considering that palatability is sometimes a concern for oral formulations intended for the paediatric
population as it may be associated with compliance to the drug, the CHMP recommended to the
applicant to perform a survey investigating the palatability of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories.
### ***Risks *** **Unfavourable effects **

The dose-limiting toxicity is the haematological effect. As the mercaptopurine dose is individually
titrated based on haematological response, no additional *systemic* toxicity is expected from the oral
suspension compared with the previously approved tablet. If a switch from tablets to oral suspension,
or vice versa, is undertaken, the physician, patients and parents should be made aware that the dose
may need to be adjusted.

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories

### **Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects **

From a Quality and Non-clinical perspective, the choice of propylparaben as preservative was

questioned, but the exposure of the patient is low, well below the lowest observed adverse event level.

Nevertheless, it is recommended to the Applicant to eliminate this preservative in the future.

An increased risk for local toxicity with the Novapurine formulation seems unlikely but has not been

prospectively addressed. It is suggested that any signals relating to local toxicity issues are handled
within the PSUR framework.

A potential risk of confusion with the inclusion of 2 different syringes in the pack is expected to be well
managed by the colour coding of the pack. Signals of such potential errors will be detected through
routine pharmacovigilance. ***Benefit-risk balance *** **Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects **

The availability of a suspension provides better accuracy and ease of administration especially when

used in small children and this is important from an efficacy as well as safety perspective. The

haematological toxicity is part of the action of mercaptopurine, well managed by titration of the drug

for individual use. The well known toxicity profile of mercaptopurine is expected to be better managed

with more accurate dosing achieved with Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories. **Benefit-risk balance **

The benefit-risk balance of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories oral suspension 20 mg/ml for the

treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia is positive.

### **Discussion on the benefit-ri**

### **sk balance **


Historically, the risk-benefit profile of 6-MP for the treatment of ALL have been well established based

on numerous multi-centre, multi-national trials in the EU and other developed countries.

Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories oral suspension ensures better precision and ease of administration

than the existing tablet form and importantly, it will provide an alternative formulation for children who
are unable to swallow tablets, and for clinicians, an alternative preparation that also allows more
flexible dosing.

### ***Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products ***

The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories is not similar

to Atriance, Evoltra, Glivec or Sprycel within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC)

No. 847/200. See appendix ***Outcome ***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the risk-benefit balance of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories in the treatment of acute

lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and children is favourable and therefore

recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
