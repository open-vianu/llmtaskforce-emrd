## **1. Background information on the procedure **
#### ***1.1. Submission of the dossier ***

The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited submitted on 17 November 2015 an application for

marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zinplava, through the centralised

procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

Zinplava (bezlotoxumab) is indicated for the prevention of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI)

recurrence in patients 18 years or older receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI.

**The legal basis for this application refers to:**

Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated

that bezlotoxumab was considered to be a new active substance.

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature

substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies).

***Information on Paediatric requirements***

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s)

P/0340/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0340/2014 was not yet completed as some

measures were deferred.

***Information relating to orphan market exclusivity***

***Similarity***

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with

authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a

condition related to the proposed indication.

**New active Substance status**

The applicant requested the active substance bezlotoxumab contained in the above medicinal product

to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a

medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

***Scientific Advice***

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 17 December 2009. The Scientific Advice

pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

## **2. Scientific discussion **
#### ***2.1. Problem statement ***

*C. difficile* is an anaerobic, spore-forming gram-positive bacillus that produces two potent toxins: toxin

A, an enterotoxin, and toxin B, which is primarily a cytotoxin. Most, if not all, strains isolated from CDI

patients have been toxin B (+) strains, with a majority also expressing toxin A. The toxins target the

gut epithelium leading to epithelial damage and inflammation in the gut.

*C. difficile* spores can persist outside the human body on hard surfaces for up to five months.

Transmission occurs through the faecal-oral route. *C. difficile* colonises the colon without causing

disease in approximately 1% to 3% of adults; the proportion is higher in patients in acute care

settings. Disruption of protective colonic microflora results in excessive growth of *C. difficile* and toxin

production and development of disease.

A novel approach to the prevention of recurrent CDI is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)

directed against the toxins produced by *C. difficile* as a form of passive immunity in patients receiving

antibiotic therapy for CDI.

***About the product***

Bezlotoxumab (MK-6072) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of *Clostridium*

*difficile* toxin B and potentially averts the damage and inflammation that can lead to the symptoms

associated with *C. difficile* infection.

Proposed therapeutic indicat i on, posol og y a nd mode of administration:

Bezlotoxumab is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) in

patients 18 years or older receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI. The recommended dose is 10 mg/kg

administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over one hour as a single dose.

**Clinical development program**

The Applicant pursues the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for bezlotoxumab.

However, the clinical development program is based on studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of a

monoclonal antibody (actoxumab) directed against *C.-difficile* toxin A; and a monoclonal antibody

(bezlotoxumab) directed against *C.-difficile* toxin B and a combination product containing both,

actoxumab and bezlotoxumab.

During the Phase 1 clinical program, conducted in healthy volunteers, all but 30 subjects were exposed

to either actoxumab (MK-3415) alone or actoxumab + bezlotuxomab (MK-3415A). The same applies

for the Phase 2 studies; subjects received either actoxumab (MK-3415) alone or actoxumab +

bezlotuxomab (MK-3415A). The Applicant does not pursue a Marketing Authorisation for actoxumab

alone or the combination of actoxumab + bezlotuxomab. Hence, these will not contribute to the

efficacy evaluation of bezlotuxumab.

Formally no Scientific Advice was requested on the development program of bezlotoxumab. However

on the development program of the combination product MK-3415A (actoxumab + bezlotoxumab), the

Applicant obtained Scientific Advice from the CHMP in December 2009.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 9/110


-----

The scientific principles outlined in the Scientific Advice may apply also for the current application. The

main aspects are as follows:

  - No further toxicology studies would be required to support the MAA, including agreement that

the absence of studies on reproduction and development is justified and that neither

genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies would be required.

  - ADME and mass-balance studies were not required, but that drug-drug interactions should be

studied using a population PK approach in Phase 3.

  - To ensure that different subgroups of patients with respect to age and renal function status

were included in the Phase 3 trials.

  - Phase 1 thorough QT studies are not required.

  - General agreement was reached on the design of the proposed Phase 3 trials including: patient

population; type and duration of standard of care antibiotic therapy (only metronidazole and

vancomycin were proposed at that time); stratification by hospitalization status (inpatient

versus outpatient) and by standard of care antibiotic therapy; primary efficacy endpoint; dose

selection; and adequacy of the size of the safety database to support the MAA.

  - The Phase 3 trials include a sufficient number of patients with severe disease and a high risk of

recurrence to demonstrate that the drug is efficacious and safe in these subgroups.

  - While the time point for assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint was deemed acceptable,

the Agency requested an evaluation of duration of protection in an extended trial phase (up to

12 months) in a subset of patients enrolled in Phase 3.

  - The design of the planned 2-dose Phase 1 study to evaluate immunogenicity was deemed by

the Agency to be acceptable. Additionally, the Agency recommended evaluation of

immunogenicity in relation to repeated use in patients (as opposed to healthy volunteers)

either in Phase 3 or in a separate post-marketing trial.

  - Plans for immunogenicity testing in the Phase 3 trials were deemed acceptable; additionally,

the Agency recommended that immunogenicity testing be extended to evaluate the

relationship between possible neutralizing antibodies

***Type of Application and aspects on development***

The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was

considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on justification brought forward by the

Applicant that the demonstration of efficacy and safety of MK-6072 for prevention of the serious

condition of CDI recurrence, for which there are no therapies indicated and which represents a critical

unmet medical need of major interest from the point of view of public health, is sufficient justification

that MK-6072 falls within the scope of an accelerated assessment.

However, during assessment (Day 120 LoQ), the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to

pursue accelerated assessment, as major objections and numerous other concerns were identified,

which could not be addressed within the accelerated timelines.

#### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

Zinplava finished product (FP) is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 25

mg/mL bezlotoxumab. It is formulated as a sterile, aqueous, preservative-free solution aseptically

filled into vials for single use.

Other ingredients are: Citric acid monohydrate (E330), Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),

Polysorbate 80 (E433), Sodium chloride, Sodium citrate dihydrate (E331), Water for injections and

Sodium hydroxide (E524).

No Quality by Design development is claimed by the applicant, however, process characterisation

studies for active substance (AS) manufacturing process were executed using a risk-based approach,

incorporating quality-by-design principles focused on increased process understanding. **2.2.2. Active Substance **

***General information***

Bezlotoxumab (also referred to as MK-6072 by the Applicant) is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb)

that binds with high affinity to Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin B. Bezlotoxumab is a glycoprotein.

A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) host cell line was used for expression of bezlotoxumab. The antibody

is heterogeneously glycosylated.

The biological activity of the bezlotoxumab was evaluated by its capacity to bind to C. difficile toxin B

fragment using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. A cell based toxin

neutralisation assay is used to measure the ability of the antibody to protect host cells from toxicity of

the toxin.

***Manufacture, characterisation and process controls***

***Description of the manufacturing process and process controls***

Bezlotoxumab manufacturing is performed at Lonza Biologics, Inc. in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,

U.S.A.

The bezlotoxumab commercial manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are

expression in cell culture in suspension Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, harvest and

purification.

Manufacture is initiated from a single vial of the working cell bank (WCB) followed by inoculum

expansion in shake flasks, roller bottles, and a disposable rocker bag. The harvested cell culture fluid

(HCCF) is further processed. Bioprocess container (BPC) bags used comply with *Ph. Eur.* (3.2.2.1) and

USP (<87>, <88>, and <661>). Prior to release to manufacturing, the BPC bags are visually inspected

and the Certificate of Analysis is checked for conformance to specifications.

***Control of materials***

A list of non-compendial grade raw materials used to manufacture MK-6072 is provided (Buffers and

solutions; chromatography resins and filters). All raw materials used in upstream and downstream

operations are animal-component free and provided with TSE/BSE certifications.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 11/110


-----

The cell bank system, characterisation and testing is sufficiently described and conforms with ICH

guideline Q5A/B. cDNA was isolated and transfected into the host cell line. From the Clone a Master

cell bank was generated and consequently expanded to a working cell bank. A limit for *in vitro* cell age

for production was defined.

***Control of critical steps and intermediates***

Critical process parameters (CPPs) and key operating parameters (KOPs) are defined throughout the

manufacturing process. The CPP classification justifications are based on viral clearance studies, large

scale range of experience, process characterisation studies and step-specific verification studies

(including bioburden reduction, small scale resin lifetime studies).

The identified CPPs and KOPs are considered adequate to control the upstream and downstream

manufacturing process for bezlotoxumab AS.

A hold time study was conducted for process intermediates at defined hold time points. The defined

hold times are based on the microbial control qualification studies and biochemical stability data from

small-scale studies performed. A cumulative intermediate hold time limit is applied and the Applicant is

asked to conduct a small scale study to further confirm the appropriate cumulative hold time as a post
authorisation recommendation.

Re-processing has been successfully validated at small scale. Reprocessing protocols were provided

for the full manufacturing scale during processing.

***Process validation***

For process validation qualification lots were manufactured using the proposed commercial

manufacturing process.

All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in
process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces

bezlotoxumab AS of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in
process acceptance criteria.

***Manufacturing process development and comparability***

The active substance process development, manufacture, and testing of preclinical, clinical and

commercial materials was carried out. The process comparability assessments indicate that

bezlotoxumab AS manufactured throughout development is comparable. The purification performance

attributes displayed similar trends.

***Characterisation***

Bezlotoxumab AS has been sufficiently characterised.

The characterisation of the bezlotoxumab AS included the determination of physicochemical and

immunochemical properties, biological activity, purity, impurities, and quantity. The primary,

secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of bezlotoxumab were evaluated.

Results indicate that bezlotoxumab exhibits properties representative of a fully human monoclonal

antibody containing heavy and light chains bound by disulfide linkages with typical levels of

heterogeneity in its mass, glycosylation, and charge profiles.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 12/110


-----

***Specification***

Specifications were set in accordance with ICH Q6B. The testing includes identity, purity, content and

potency. The batch release data confirm compliance with the proposed commercial specifications.

The applicant is recommended to revisit the criteria after the manufacture of 30 commercial batches

and tighten the release criteria accordingly. This recommendation applies to AS and FP.

***Analytical methods***

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods)

appropriately validated in accordance with guideline ICH Q2(R1). The validation reports are provided

and demonstrate that the analytical methods are successfully validated with respect to accuracy,

precision, specificity, linearity and robustness.

***Batch analysis***

Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within the specifications and

confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.

***Reference material***

The establishments and history of in-house reference standard have been outlined for bezlotoxumab.

***Stability***

An initial shelf life of 24 months is proposed for Bezlotoxumab AS when stored in bags at 2−8 ºC.

Stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf

life.
#### **2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product **

***Description of the product and pharmaceutical development***

Zinplava finished product (FP) is a sterile, aqueous, preservative-free solution. Vials contain a target

deliverable dose of 40 mL at 25 mg/mL bezlotoxumab for a total of 1000 mg per vial. The finished

product is diluted into a compatible diluent (0.9 % Sodium Chloride Injection or 5 % Dextrose

Injection) prior to administration by intravenous infusion.

The finished product is a sterile, clear to moderately opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid, free

from visible particles. The finished product has a target pH of 6.0. and contains the following

excipients: sodium chloride, sodium citrate dihydrate and citric acid monohydrate, polysorbate 80,

DTPA and water for injection. Zinplava finished product is supplied in 50 mL vial Type I glass vials with

a chlorobutyl stopper and a flip-off cap seal. The material complies with *Ph.Eur.* and EC requirements.

The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the

intended use of the product.

The finished product does not contain any overages.

Manufacturing history was sufficiently outlined. The results of the comparability assessments

demonstrate comparability of FP materials manufactured throughout the development. A risk
assessment approach was used throughout the development of the Zinplava manufacturing process.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 13/110


-----

The Container Closure integrity (CCI) for the 50-mL container-closure system (glass type I) used for

Zinplava finished product liquid is assured. The CCI for the 50-mL container-closure system has been

demonstrated and will be monitored as part of the stability protocol.

Bezlotoxumab infusion solution was evaluated for biochemical and physical compatibility with various

administration materials. Zinplava FP may be diluted in either 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride or 5% (w/v)

dextrose for infusion solution preparation from 0.9-10 mg/mL. Zinplava infusion solutions are

biochemically and physically compatible with a variety of commonly available IV containers, IV
administration sets, IV filters, and IV catheters. The use of an inline or add-on filter is required during

administration. These studies support compatibility of the Zinplava infusion solution with commonly

available filter materials and pore sizes (0.2-5 μm).

Microbial proliferation studies limit the hold time for the Zinplava infusion solution to 16 hours at room

temperature and 24 hours at refrigerated (2-8 °C) temperature.

***Manufacture of the product and process controls***

For the manufacture of Zinplava bezlotoxumab AS is delivered as formulated bulk solution containing

the exact formulation of the finished product from Lonza Biologics (US) to Carlow MSD (Ireland).

Zinplava FP is manufactured and filled. Sterile filtration is performed continuously throughout the filling

process and consists of closed system filtration through a 0.2-μm bioburden-reducing filter and a 0.2
μm sterile membrane filter into an intermediate (dosing) vessel within a filling isolator. The sterile
filtered solution is subsequently filled aseptically into vials, closed with stoppers, and sealed with caps.

Adequate in process controls were set.

All excipients used during the AS and FP manufacture have compendial *Ph.Eur.* grade except

diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid for which no *Ph.Eur.* monograph exists but it is conform to USP. No

excipients of human or animal origin and no novel excipients are present in Zinplava FP.

***Product specification***

Finished product specifications were set in accordance with ICH Q6B and the corresponding active

substance specifications. Acceptable verification of the methods physical appearance, sub visible

particles, extractable volume, endotoxin and sterility was performed for finished product samples.

The method for container closure integrity was validated. The other analytical methods from the

specifications were validated for active substance and finished product.

***Stability of the product***

The agreed shelf life for Zinplava finished product is 18 months at 2-8 °C (refrigerator) for the

unopened vial.

Stability studies have been performed using the commercial vial/stopper combination of the Zinplava

1000 mg finished product (FP).

For storage of the solution for infusion, chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated

for 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C or 16 hours at room temperature (at or below 25°C). These time limits

include storage of the infusion solution in the IV bag through the duration of infusion. From a

microbiological point of view, the product must be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use

storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and must not be longer than

a total of 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C.

This is acceptable as storage for 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C or for 16 hours at room temperature (at or

below 25°C) is supported.

***Adventitious agents***

**TSE compliance**

The active substance bezlotoxumab is produced in a serum-free medium and no materials of animal or

human origin are used during production (fermentation or purification). Compliance with the TSE

Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated.

**Virus safety**

Bezlotoxumab is expressed in cells adapted to serum-free medium. Other than the cells themselves,

no material of animal origin is added during fermentation. The cell banking system has been

extensively screened for adventitious viruses using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. The tests

did not reveal any presence of virus contaminants in the cell banks with the exception of intracellular

type A and extracellular type C retrovirus-like particles which are well known to be present in rodent

cells. This is considered acceptable and it is considered that sufficient capacity within the

manufacturing process exists to inactivate/remove such virus particles. At the end of the bezlotoxumab

fermentation procedure, general testing for adventitious viruses is performed.

In summary, the TSE and viral safety of bezlotoxumab is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated.
#### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has

been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the

product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

No major concerns were identified during marketing authorisation assessment. Several other concerns

pertaining to issues including stability and proposed specifications could be resolved by the Applicant

during the procedure. Three recommendations are suggested in order to clarify the step on cumulative

hold time of 24 days at the stage of the purification process of the AS, to revise the acceptance criteria

for active substance and finished product release specifications after 30 commercial batches have been

produced and to implement the process-specific ELISA assay for bezlotoxumab host-cell protein (HCP).

Overall, the dossier is of acceptable quality. The manufacturing of bezlotoxumab AS and Zinplava FP is

appropriately described, validated and controlled.

The information presented on adventitious agents is considered acceptable. The manufacturing process

has demonstrated good viral removal and/or inactivation capacity. **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory manner. Data

has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.
#### **2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development **

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,

the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

1. No cumulative hold time has been established for bezlotoxumab AS purification process yet. The

Applicant will perform a small-scale study to establish the cumulative hold time to ensure that there is

no adverse impact to product quality when each process intermediate is held to a proposed maximum

hold time. Until the study is complete, a cumulative intermediate hold time limit of 24 days will be

applied to future manufacturing batches. The applicant should submit the results of the study as soon

as available. If the study suggests a different cumulative intermediate hold time limit the applicant is

asked to file a variation.

2. Only slight changes to the acceptance criteria were made for active substance and finished product

release specifications. These are based on tolerance intervals for batches produced so far. This is

currently acceptable. The applicant should revisit the criteria after the manufacture of 30 commercial

batches and revise the criteria accordingly.

3. The Applicant is in the process of developing a process-specific ELISA assay for bezlotoxumab host
cell protein (HCP) determination. The implementation of the assay should be reported to the health

authority after successful validation. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

Bezlotoxumab is indicated for the prevention of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) recurrence in

patients 18 years or older receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI. *Clostridium difficile* ( *C. difficile* ) is an

anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that colonizes and infects patients whose normal

gut microbiota has been disrupted by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Bassetti *et al*, 2012).

Recurrence is common after antibiotic treatment of *C. difficile* infection (CDI). The symptoms of

primary and recurrent CDI are caused by 2 exotoxins, *C. difficile* toxin A (TcdA) and *C. difficile* toxin B

(TcdB).

The fully human mAb to *Clostridium difficile* toxin A is designated actoxumab (previously known as

CDA1, GS-CDA1 and MK-3415), and the fully human mAb to *C. difficile* toxin B is designated

bezlotoxumab (previously known as MDX- 1388, CDB1 and MK-6072). The combined administration of

these two fully human mAbs is designated actoxumab+bezlotoxumab (previously known as MK
3415A). **2.3.2. Pharmacology **

Bezlotoxumab prevents binding of the toxin B to its target cells by binding to regions of the “combined

repetitive oligopeptide” (CROP) domains of the toxin that partially overlap with putative receptor

binding pockets. This results in blockade of the cellular intoxication cascade at its first step. The

protective effects of bezlotoxumab have been shown *in vitro* in TcdB neutralization assays, and in

nonclinical studies in mouse and hamster models of CDI (in combination with actoxumab, since

bezlotoxumab alone has poor efficacy in rodent models).

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 16/110


-----

The affinities of bezlotoxumab and actoxumab binding to TcdB and TcdA (from the control *C. difficile*

strain VPI 10463), respectively, were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and revealed Kd

values of 19 and 370 pM for bezlotoxumab binding to TcdB (best fit of the data was to a two-site

binding model), and 610 pM for actoxumab binding to TcdA. Actoxumab is selective for TcdA and

bezlotoxumab is selective for TcdB; no binding of actoxumab to TcdB or of bezlotoxumab to TcdA was

observed (Vero cells). A peptide corresponding to the N-terminal half of the CROP domain of TcdB was

co-crystalized with Fab fragments of bezlotoxumab and revealed that Fab fragments bind side-by-side

to 2 highly homologous epitopes within the CROP domain. This model is in line with binding

stoichiometry experiments carried out by size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle

laser light scattering in which the stoichiometry of bezlotoxumab to CROP domain was 1:1 and was

independent of the molar ratio of the 2 proteins.

Cellular effects mediated by TcdA and TcdB were investigated such as morphological changes, Rac1

glucosylation, disruption of epithelial integrity, cellular viability, and adhesion of *C. difficile* to Caco-2

cells. These effects were neutralized by actoxumab and bezlotoxumab in a concentration dependent

manner. The ability of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab to block binding of TcdA and TcdB to the surface

of mammalian cells was assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting.

Neutralization of *C. difficile* Toxins A and B from genetically-distinct strains of *C. difficile* by actoxumab

and bezlotoxumab was investigated by ELISA. *C. difficile* strain VPI 10463 (ribotype 087) was used as

a reference strain. Full neutralization of the toxins in culture supernatants of all clinical isolates tested

(81 clinical isolates of *C. difficile* from the USA, Canada, Western Europe, and Japan; (ribotypes 001,

002, 003, 012, 014, 017, 018, 023, 027, 053, 063, 077, 078, 081, 087, 106, 198, and 369)) including

multiple isolates of the endemic strains of ribotype 027/toxinotype III and ribotype 078/toxinotype V,

was achieved by actoxumab and bezlotoxumab. Increase in the EC 50 values of bezlotoxumab for TcdB

of strains of ribotype 027, 036, and 078 are caused by amino acid substitutions at key positions within

the epitopes. The results indicate also that for a number of strains, the TcdA concentration was too low

to be detected, whereas TcdB was detected in supernatants of all strains tested.

Preclinical *in vivo* efficacy of actoxumab+bezlotoxumab was evaluated in the Golden Syrian hamster

model of infection (at doses of 0.5 to 50 mg/Kg) and in the mouse CDI model (at doses of 2, 5, 10 and

50 mg/Kg). Treatment with actoxumab+bezlotoxumab improved animal survival (in mice and

hamsters) and decreased morbidity when administered prophylactically or therapeutically, and in both

primary and recurrent CDI models. Fc-mediated functions of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab do not

appear to play a role in the *in vivo* efficacy, based on the comparison of N297Q mutants to that of

wild-type showing they had similar efficacy in both primary and relapse versions of a mouse model of

CDI (at a dose of 10mg/Kg).

The ability of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab to directly neutralize TcdA and TcdB *in vivo* was assessed

following systemic administration of either TcdA or TcdB in mice. Whereas administration of actoxumab

24 hours before intraperitoneal (IP) challenge with 100ng TcdA increased animal survival, in a similar

experiment with TcdB challenge, only a polyclonal goat anti-toxin B serum was protective whereas

several monoclonal antibodies (MDX1388 [bezlotoxumab], 2A11, 1G10 and 103-174) were not.

However, in a subsequent experiment in mice challenged with a mixture of TcdA and TcdB (25 ng

each), the combination of actoxumab+bezlotoxumab was protective.

Although clinical study results suggest that neutralization of toxin B is sufficient to reduce the risk of

recurrent disease in humans; the preclinical efficacy data relay on the combination of actoxumab and

bezlotoxumab rather than bezlotoxumab alone. From *in vivo* models it is concluded that the

combination of actoxumab+bezlotoxumab improves animal survival and decreased morbidity.

Treatment with actoxumab might have a minor effect but bezlotoxumab alone seems to be inefficient

in hamster models, whereas each antibody alone has partial protective effects in mouse models.

EMA/853812/2016 Page 17/110


-----

The study performed in piglets by Steele *et al*, JID 2013:207 (15 January) revealed that “piglets

treated with anti-TcdB antibodies, whether alone or in addition to anti-TcdA, were completely protected

from the development of systemic signs of CDI” and that “Histopathologic lesions in the large intestine

were slightly more severe in piglets treated with monoclonal anti-TcdA + anti-TcdB than in those

treated with only monoclonal anti-TcdB”. Treatment with bezlotoxumab or bezlotoxumab + actoxumab

protected the piglets in the same way as mice and hamsters with bezlotoxumab + actoxumab. Data

show that both antibodies are transported into the intestinal lumen at the site of infection in piglets

and hamsters supporting the suggestion that the general pathogenesis of CDI and mechanisms of

protection by bezlotoxumab or by actoxumab + bezlotoxumab are comparable in different hosts,

although neutralization of toxin A is not required for efficacy in human and piglet disease. One

hypothesis about the cause of this dichotomy is that different host species may express cellular surface

receptors with different affinities for the two toxins. Even though the gnotobiotic piglet model has its

advantages, it is an exploratory and relatively difficult CDI model to work with. With regard to

reproducibility and ability to assess a sufficient number of animals, the rodent model is preferable.

However, several aspects of the underlying mechanism of both CDI and the protection offered by anti
toxin antibodies are still unknown. Further development and use of the gnotobiotic piglet model may in

future investigations provide valuable knowledge on how the two toxins affect the gut and how anti
toxin treatment can protect against CDI.

As also demonstrated in hamsters and mice, antibody administration did not impact *C. difficile* burden

in the intestines of gnotobiotic piglets. Bezlotoxumab is able to prevent recurrence of CDI by

neutralizing toxin B produced, thereby preventing intestinal lesions. Recovery of the microbiome over

time following the initial infection is associated with clearance of *C. difficile* colonization in mice and

hamsters, and may explain why bezlotoxumab prevents recurrence rather than simply delaying it.
#### **2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics **

Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with sparse sampling were conducted in healthy hamsters. Actoxumab

and bezlotoxumab median serum concentrations that corresponded to a CDI efficacy survival time

point of 48 hr after the last dose were 350 and 320 µg/mL, respectively (PK001) and somewhat higher

in another study (PK006: 588 and 493 µg/mL,). *In vivo* tissue distribution studies in hamsters

demonstrated that actoxumab and bezlotoxumab reached the site of infection in the lumen of the gut,

and were detected at significantly higher levels in hamsters with CDI compared with healthy hamsters.

*In vitro* studies using a two-dimensional Caco-2 monolayer culture system demonstrated that antibody

applied to the basolateral chamber translocated to the apical chamber to a much greater extent when

toxin was added to the apical side.

It can be concluded from these data that systemically administered antibodies localize to the

subepithelial space of the gut wall and leak into the lumen via toxin-induced lesions, binding to and

neutralizing toxin in this compartment, or any toxin that may have leaked to the basolateral/systemic

side.

No formal pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted. Since bezlotoxumab is

eliminated by catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are expected.

#### **2.3.4. Toxicology **

Nonclinical toxicology studies with bezlotoxumab and actoxumab, alone and in combination as

bezlotoxumab + actoxumab were performed in mice. This is acceptable as there is no species in which

target-mediated toxicity can be investigated. No findings of toxicological significance were observed in

the single (4 weeks) or repeat-dose toxicity studies (2 or 3 weeks studies) performed with

bezlotoxumab and/or actoxumab. No anti-bezlotoxumab or anti-actoxumab antibodies were detected

in any animals in the test article-treated groups. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for

bezlotoxumab alone or in combination with actoxumab was ≥125 mg/kg/dose. This is up to 5 fold over

the exposure in humans at the clinically recommended dose (10mg/Kg).

Tissue cross-reactivity studies with bezlotoxumab and actoxumab were performed with normal human

or Swiss Webster or CD1™ mouse tissues. There were no findings of toxicological significance observed

in the *in vitro.*

The provided Toxicology investigation is appropriate for an antibody against foreign target according

ICH S6(R1) guidance. “A short-term safety study in one species can be considered; no additional

toxicity studies, including reproductive toxicity studies, are appropriate.” Therefore animal reproduction

or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with bezlotoxumab. **2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

As stated in the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use

(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447), antibodies are unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. Based

on this, the Applicant’s justification for not submitting an ERA for bezlotoxumab is considered

acceptable. **2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

*In vitro* pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetic were appropriately investigated for both

antibodies (actoxumab+bezlotoxumab) against foreign targets ( *C. difficile* toxin A and toxin B). *In vivo*

pharmacology was extensively investigated in mice and hamsters. Although clinical study results

suggest that neutralization of toxin B is sufficient to reduce the risk of recurrent disease in humans,

the preclinical efficacy data rely on the combination of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab instead of

bezlotoxumab alone. The differences in results between the different animal models, with links to the

results seen in the clinical setting, was provided and discussed. Data show that both antibodies are

transported into the intestinal lumen at the site of infection in piglets and hamsters, supporting the

suggestion that the general pathogenesis of CDI and mechanisms of protection by bezlotoxumab or by

actoxumab + bezlotoxumab are comparable in different hosts, even though neutralization of toxin A is

not required for efficacy in human and piglet disease. A hypothesis about the reason is that different

host species may express cellular surface receptors with different affinities for the two toxins. Even

though the gnotobiotic piglet model has its advantages, it is an explorative and relatively difficult CDI

model to work with. With regard to reproducibility and ability to assess a sufficient number of animals,

the rodent model is preferable. However, several aspects of the underlying mechanism of both CDI and

the protection offered by anti-toxin antibodies, are still unknown. Further development and use of the

gnotobiotic piglet model may in future investigations provide valuable knowledge on how the two

toxins affect the gut and how anti-toxin treatment can protect against CDI.

As also demonstrated in hamsters and mice, antibody administration did not impact *C. difficile* burden

in the intestines of gnotobiotic piglets. Bezlotoxumab is able to prevent recurrence of CDI by

neutralizing toxin B produced, thereby preventing intestinal lesions. Recovery of the microbiome over

time following the initial infection is associated with clearance of *C. difficile* colonization and may

explain why bezlotoxumab prevents recurrence. This hypothesis was further substantiated by the

demonstration that microbiome recovery was inversely correlated to the *C. difficile* burden.
#### **2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose
toxicity. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential have not been evaluated.

Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with bezlotoxumab.

There were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in mice based on repeat

dose toxicity studies and no binding to reproductive tissues was observed in tissue cross-reactivity

studies. It is unknown whether bezlotoxumab is secreted in human milk. Appropriate statements are

added to SmPC, section 4.6 (Fertility, pregnancy and lactation) and 5.3 (Preclinical safety data).

For Zinplava, a marketing authorisation can be granted from a non-clinical point of view. ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction **

***GCP***

The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. One US centre

was closed to further enrolment as a result of serious GCP non-compliance issues identified by the

clinical research associate at the site. The data from this site was excluded from all efficacy analyses,

but was retained in safety analyses.

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the

community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

**Table 1. Tabular overview of clinical studies**

The development program comprises studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of a monoclonal

antibody (actoxumab) directed against *C.-difficile* toxin A; a monoclonal antibody (bezlotoxumab)

directed against *C.-difficile* toxin B and a combination product of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab.

Considering the safety and efficacy data, the Applicant concluded that actoxumab alone is not

efficacious and actoxumab + bezlotoxumab do not have any safety or efficacy benefit over

bezlotoxumab alone. Therefore, the Applicant selected bezlotoxumab for marketing authorisation.

Besides two pivotal Phase 3 trials, the clinical pharmacology program for bezlotoxumab included four

Phase 1 trials evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of bezlotoxumab

administered alone or in combination (actoxumab + bezlotoxumab), in healthy adult subjects and one

Phase 2 trial in patients with CDI.
#### **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

Assays

The screening ADA assay was not sufficiently sensitive and thus inconclusive for about one third of the

subjects due to low drug tolerance. In patients with positive/inconclusive ADA result, no potential

influence of ADA on PK after the first dose is detectable. The risk of impactful immunogenicity-related

effects in CDI patients following a repeated dose is considered low. This is supported by 29 healthy

subjects who received two doses of actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, no treatment emergent ADA positive

subject has been identified. However, immunogenicity incidence after re-administration in patients

remains a potential risk and missing information.

Free bezlotoxumab concentrations in serum were measured using a first and a more specific second

generation immunoassay. Due to interference by endogenous anti-toxin B in the first generation assay,

only data from those studies using the second generation assay [P004, P005, P006 (Phase 1); P001,

P002 (Phase 3)] were included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 21/110


-----

Semi-quantitative bezlotoxumab detection in stool samples was done in one Phase 3 study using the

same immunoassay-design which detects free bezlotoxumab only.

Pharmacokinetics of bezlotox u mab

Non-compartmental PK analysis of Phase 1 PK data in healthy subjects for bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg)

that was administered intravenously either alone or in combination resulted in ranges of characteristic

PK parameter values: Cmax (223 – 302 µg/ml), tmax (0.5 – 2 h), AUC0-inf (73300 – 92700 µg*h/ml),

half-life t1/2 (18-27 d) as well as values for volume of distribution Vdss (5 – 7 L), and for clearance CL

(0.18-0.26 L/d).

Serum concentrations of bezlotoxumab declined in a biphasic manner in the 12 weeks following

infusion and did not differ when bezlotoxumab was administered alone or with actoxumab. No evidence

of target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) was observed based on visual inspection of individual

concentration time profiles. From study P004, minimal accumulation in bezlotoxumab exposure could

be detected, when a second dose of 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab in combination 84 days after the first

dose was administered.

In patients, PK profiles after a single dose of 10 mg/kg IV were available from two Phase 3 trials and

characterized by predicted AUCinf of 53.000 µg*h/ml, Cmax of 185 µg/ml and t1/2 of 18.7 days. It is

obvious that AUC exposure in healthy subjects is 43% higher compared to patients. The difference in

bezlotoxumab exposures between the healthy subject and patient populations is mainly attributed to

differences in baseline albumin level. The general health of patients with CDI is poorer and is reflected

in lower albumin levels than healthy subjects. Despite the differential exposures of bezlotoxumab, the

shapes of the concentration-time profiles in healthy subjects and patients appear to be similar.

Characterization of bezlotoxumab PK is supported by population PK analysis based on pooled data

obtained from Phase 1 (P004, P005, and P006) and Phase 3 (P001 and P002) trials. Therefore, a

dataset based on data from administration of bezlotoxumab (monotherapy and combination) in healthy

volunteers (72 subjects) and patients (1515 subjects) was created. In total, 8784 evaluable

bezlotoxumab concentrations were included in the population PK analysis. Regarding the patient

population, 381+ 386 = 767 subjects (50.6%) had evaluable bezlotoxumab PK for the population PK

analysis resulting from monotherapy.

Population PK estimation for patients resulted in a low clearance of 0.317 L/day and a limited volume

of distribution of 7.33 L), respectively. These typical values are consistent with those of other human

monoclonal antibodies.

As a protein product, bezlotoxumab is not expected to be eliminated by renal or biliary excretion but

through protein catabolism. Of note, bezlotoxumab appears to be excreted in faeces by direct

“transport” across disrupted epithelium into the gut lumen, the location of infection. However,

bezlotoxumab was detected in only a low fraction of stool samples and this proportion was higher in

the combination MK-3415 treatment arm. Relationship between mAb detection on stool and its effects

on serum concentrations is not clearly understood. Due to assay limitations, care should be taken in

interpreting the qualitative results. Stool bezlotoxumab data were intended to be supportive of the

mechanism of action whereby systemically available bezlotoxumab was shown reach the gut lumen

and be detected in stool. As the MAH agrees, stool sample results cannot be used to draw any

quantitative conclusions. The key reason for the discrepancy between combination therapy and

monotherapy in the proportion of stool samples with bezlotoxumab detected is still unknown. From

study P004 (29 healthy volunteers) giving two sequential doses, a low intra-individual variability was

derived for healthy subjects (< 10 %CV). Population PK simulations result in PK parameter AUC0-inf

-----

and Cmax with low to moderate inter-individual variability in healthy subjects (17.8 %CV, 14.0 %CV)

and within the target patient population (40.2 %CV, 20.7 %CV), respectively.

***Dose proportionality and time dependencies***

Deviation from dose proportionality was not observable in healthy subjects (study P020, range 0.3

mg/kg – 20 mg/kg), albeit using a first generation assay and a formulation different with that intended

for the market. The applicant has described the assessment of comparability between three

bezlotoxumab drug substance manufacturing processes demonstrating that the different formulations

are comparable. However, there are no patient PK data after other doses than 10 mg/kg. Therefore, no

conclusion on dose proportionality in patients can be drawn. The range of AUC in patients overlaps with

the range of AUC of healthy subjects receiving 10 mg/kg. Given that the influence of albumin is

accounted for by population PK analysis, extrapolation of dose proportionality from healthy subjects to

the patient population is possible.

***Special populations***

Evaluation of pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab in special populations has been based on population

PK analysis. In total, 17 covariates have been statistically tested and addressed. Albumin, gender

(male), Japanese were identified as significant covariates on both Cl and Vdss, and race (black)

additionally on clearance. Bodyweight was included as structural covariate on both clearance and

volume. The allometric exponents for CL and Vc were both 0.477, which is supportive for body-weight

based dosing regimen. No significant effects of impaired renal and hepatic function, gender, race, age,

comorbid conditions, endogenous IgG to toxin B on bezlotoxumab PK were observed. Albumin level

(range: 1 to 6 g/dL) and body weight (range: 30-194 kg) explained most of the inter-patient
variability in bezlotoxumab PK.

In phase 3 trials, half of the patients (51%) were elderly (≥ 65 years), 29% were older than 75 years.

The small decrease in AUC in patients older than 65 years is explainable by both the association of age

to albumin and high age to relatively lower level of weight. Age distribution is homogenous; no age

influence could be detected.

**Table 2. Number of elderly subjects in Phase 3 trials**

***Pharmacokinetic interaction studies***

|Col1|Age 65-74 (Older subjects number /total number)|Age 75+ (Older subjects number /total number)|
|---|---|---|
|Phase 3 trials 001/002|344/1504|459/1504|



The effect of bezlotoxumab on co-administered drugs is not expected. Population PK analysis did not

indicate that concomitant use of Standard of care (SoC) therapy (oral metronidazole, oral vancomycin,

and oral fidaxomicin), non-SoC antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors have effects on bezlotoxumab

PK. Furthermore, population PK analysis could not detect a significant impact of possible interaction by

co-administered actoxumab on bezlotoxumab PK.

Overall, PK characterization in patients is limited. Only data after one dose (10 mg/kg) are available,

and the new excretion pathway into the gut and its effects are not fully clear.

#### **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics **

***Mechanism of action and primary pharmacology***

Bezlotoxumab is a fully human mAb of the immunoglobulin G1 isotype with two κ light chains (IgG1κ),

which binds with high affinity to *C. difficile* toxin B. Bezlotoxumab was developed for the adjuvant

treatment (in addition to standard of care antibiotics) of recurrence of *C. difficile* infection (CDI) in

patients that are 18 years or older.

The two main virulence factors of *C. difficile* are the large toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which enter colonic

epithelial cells and cause fluid secretion, inflammation, and cell death, as stated in a recent publication

in PNAS (La France *et al* ., 2015). The applicant discussed if bezlotoxumab enters colonic epithelial cells

to bind and neutralise toxin B and has not rejected the possibility that bezlotoxumab can enter the

colonic epithelial cells. The applicant further discussed the above-mentioned article and stated that

there are no data to suggest that the interaction of bezlotoxumab with toxin B can occur anywhere but

outside the cells, or indeed that bezlotoxumab enters mammalian cells at all as part of the mechanism

of toxin neutralization.

Bezlotoxumab is able to bind to toxin B that is produced in case of CDI, blocking its binding and

neutralizing the bioactivity of the toxin. However, data is lacking regarding the activity of

bezlotoxumab against toxin B from *C. difficile* of food/animal origin, and regarding cross-reactivity

against large clostridial glucosylating toxins other than toxin B. No relevant PD biomarker (e.g. toxin B

concentration) was evaluated in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 program in order to prove this mode of

action in patients. Given the clinical endpoint which is based on a relative simple outcome measures

(diarrhoea), the absence of evaluation of pharmacodynamic measures the Phase 1 and Phase 2 is

acceptable.

However, the exact mode of action and site of effect are not completely understood. It is unclear

whether bezlotoxumab has to be excreted into the gut to be effective or toxin inhibition also occurs on

the interstitial site of the gut epithelium. From the presented stool data, no conclusion for a

relationship between AUC and the proportion of subjects with bezlotoxumab detected in stool can be

drawn. Thus, the relevance of exposure parameter (AUC serum or stool) for PK/PD relationship

remains unclear.

As the goal of bezlotoxumab therapy is to prevent the recurrence of an intestinal infection, the

presence of bezlotoxumab in stool was assessed in Study P002 to inform if bezlotoxumab could reach

the intestinal lumen, the site of infection in humans. The results are inconclusive.

***Secondary pharmacology***

Monoclonal antibody therapeutics have very low potential to interact with the extracellular or

intracellular (pore) domains on the hERG ion channel and, therefore, are highly unlikely to inhibit hERG

channel activity based on their targeted, specific binding properties. Per ICH guidelines, a clinical study

of the effect of monoclonal antibodies on the QT interval is not required and based on these

considerations, a dedicated clinical evaluation of the effects of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab on QTc

prolongation was not performed as part of the clinical development program. Instead, ECGs were

collected as part of the Phase 3 studies (P001, P002); ECG measurements were taken at 2 time points

on Day 1: pre infusion and within 120 minutes post infusion. It should be noted that subjects were not

excluded from the study if they had abnormal ECG findings at baseline. Likewise, subjects receiving

medications known to prolong QT were not excluded. Bezlotoxumab is not associated with clinically

relevant QTc prolongation.

**Immunogenicity**

The immunogenicity potential of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in two Phase 1 trials (P004, P006) and

the two pivotal Phase 3 trials (P001 and P002). In the Phase 1 trials, no healthy subjects had samples

which tested positive for anti bezlotoxumab antibodies. This includes subjects dosed repeatedly (Day 1

and Day 85) with actoxumab + bezlotoxumab. In the Phase 3 trials, there were no bezlotoxumab

treatment-emergent positive subjects (i.e., first identified as positive after treatment), although there

were 9 of 1414 (0.6%) non treatment- emergent positive subjects (i.e., already positive at baseline).

In the Phase 3 trials, bezlotoxumab serum concentrations decreased below the DTL as measured in the

last available serum concentration sample such that 1013 of the 1414 subjects (71.6%) were reported

as negative and 392 of the 1414 subjects (27.7%) were reported as inconclusive.

ADA assays were not suitable to detect ADAs in one third of the subjects due to low drug level

tolerance. Since multiple repeat re-treatments with bezlotoxumab over the years cannot be ruled out,

the applicant was requested to address the question of inadequate ADA assay performance (~30%

inconclusiveness) as well as the potential risk in case of bezlotoxumab re-administration in ADA
positive patients. There is no indication that inconclusive patients would differ in immunogenicity

incidence from ~70% conclusive patients.

Based on data from a single administration, bezlotoxumab seems to have a low potential for

immunogenicity. However, no confirmative data are available concerning multiple administrations of

bezlotoxumab in patients (who could be older and immunocompromised, compared to healthy

subjects); therefore it is important that post-marketing adverse event reports of patients with

repeated administration of Bezlotoxumab are thoroughly monitored and analysed in the future. In

addition, in order to inform the physicians, it should be clearly stated in the SmPC that there is no

experience with multiple administrations in CDI patients. The immunogenicity incidence after re
administration in patients remains a potential risk and missing information. The lack of experience with

repeated administration in CDI patients is stated in the SmPC.

**Relationship between plasma and effect**

Exposure-efficacy analysis results indicate that History of CDI in the past 6 months, baseline albumin

level, age, and a Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥ 3 were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the

rate of CDI recurrence for patients treated with placebo. There is no clear relationship between

exposure and response for patients that received bezlotoxumab treatment. Any association between

CDI recurrence and bezlotoxumab AUC is attributed to albumin level, rather than a direct relationship

between exposure and CDI recurrence.

Concerning exposure-safety relationship, no connection between the incidence of adverse events (AE)

and exposure could be detected, but a markedly inverse relationship between severe AE (SAE)

incidence and exposure was observed. Higher incidence of SAE at lower AUC levels could be attributed

to patients’ health status, as patients of poor health tend to have lower albumin and AUC levels as

compared to healthy subjects. After albumin-normalization the inverse relationship disappeared,

confirming this assumption.

#### **2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology **

The package on pharmacodynamics to support the MAA is limited. No pharmacodynamic measures

were evaluated in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 program. Given the clinical endpoint which is based on a

relative simple outcome measures (diarrhoea), the absence of evaluation of pharmacodynamic

measures the Phase 1 and Phase 2 is acceptable.

As the goal of bezlotoxumab therapy is to prevent the recurrence of an intestinal infection, the

presence of bezlotoxumab in stool was assessed in Study P002 to inform if bezlotoxumab could reach

the intestinal lumen, the site of infection in humans. The results remain inconclusive and do not allow

any quantitative conclusions. The levels of bezlotoxumab required for inactivation of toxin B in the gut

lumen to prevent CDI recurrence are not known. Moreover, data regarding the activity of

bezlotoxumab against toxin B from *C. difficile* of food/animal origin, and data regarding cross-reactivity

against large clostridial glucosylating toxins other than toxin B are still lacking.

Bezlotoxumab is not associated with clinically relevant QTc prolongation

Bezlotoxumab belongs to the class of therapeutic antibodies that are primarily eliminated by protein

catabolism, and, thus, concomitant medication use is not anticipated to influence the exposure of

bezlotoxumab. Drugs that affect the cytochrome P450 family and other metabolizing enzymes are not

expected to interfere with the catabolism of immunoglobulins.

Furthermore, bezlotoxumab is not expected to directly affect cytochrome P450 family members or

transporters typically affected by small molecules. In addition, bezlotoxumab targets toxin B of C.

difficile, an exogenous target, and therefore its target is not a component of the immune system or of

any other pathway potentially involved in drug metabolism or the immune response. These properties

make it unlikely that bezlotoxumab will mediate clinically meaningful pharmacodynamic drug-drug

interactions with medications that are highly metabolized or transported.

Bezlotoxumab has a low potential to elicit the formation of anti-drug-antibodies after single dose

application. Limited data on repeat application (Day 1 and Day 85) in healthy subjects also are

available and no signal on ADA development was observed. Since multiple repeat re-treatments with

bezlotoxumab over the years cannot be ruled out, the Applicant should further address the potential

for immunogenicity, post-marketing (RMP measure). **2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology **

Considering the nature of the product and the mode of action, the clinical pharmacology is deemed

acceptable. Limitations in the knowledge of the product’s clinical pharmacology are reflected in the

SmPC.

The effect of repeated administration of bezlotoxumab with potential for immunogenicity is stated as

an RMP safety concern.

#### ***2.5. Clinical efficacy *** **2.5.1. Dose response studies **

No dose response studies were performed. The target dose for bezlotuxomab of 10 mg/kg was

selected based on data from non-clinical studies (in a hamster model of CDI) and clinical trials in

healthy subjects and patients.

The 10 mg/kg dose in healthy subjects led to median serum levels that were approximately equivalent

to the levels that provided protection from acute CDI in a hamster model.

The efficacy data observed in Study P017 supported the continued evaluation of 10 mg/kg actoxumab

+bezlotoxumab in the two pivotal Phase 3 trials (Study P001, Study P002). Although doses lower and

higher than 10 mg/kg were studied in healthy volunteers, only a 10 mg/kg dose was tested in Phase 2

and 3 trials. Because of the large magnitude of reduction in CDI recurrence observed in Phase 2 with

10 mg/kg dose, the applicant did not expect that higher doses would add clinically meaningful benefit.

Conversely, lower doses were not studied in Phase 3, as acceptable safety was demonstrated at 10

mg/kg in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. **2.5.2. Main studies **

***Methods***

Both **P001** and **P002** were Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multicentre

studies conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of the mAb bezlotoxumab in adult

subjects 18 years of age and older with CDI who were receiving standard of care antibiotic therapy for

a primary or recurrent episode of CDI. The intended sample size was 400 subjects in each treatment

group; thus, ~1600 subjects were enrolled in **P001** (~400/group for the 4 treatment groups), and

~1200 subjects were enrolled in **P002** (~400/group for the 3 treatment groups).

**P001** had an adaptive design whereby one or both of the individual mAb treatment groups

(actoxumab and/or bezlotoxumab) could be dropped based on the results of an interim analysis if

there was a significant difference in the reduction of CDI recurrence when compared to actoxumab +

bezlotoxumab.

**P002** did not have an interim analysis; however, an adaptation was permitted if the bezlotoxumab

alone arm was dropped in **P001** based on recommendations of the eDMC at the time of the interim

analysis.

Study **P002** is identical to **P001** in design and conduct (see figure below), with the following three

major exceptions:

  - P002 contained three treatment groups (bezlotoxumab, actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, and

placebo)

  - No interim analysis was planned for study P002

  - P002 had an extended follow-up period of 9 months conducted in a subset of subjects to

assess for CDI recurrence through Month 12.

Overall, this extension phase was conducted in a subset of ~300 subjects who completed the

primary 12-week study period. Study visits occurred on Month 6 (± 10 days), Month 9 (± 10

days), and Month 12 (± 10 days) during which a stool or rectal swab sample was collected for

testing of carriage of toxigenic *C. difficile* . Anaerobic culture and other ancillary microbiological

assessments (including microbial identification, toxigenic strain typing, and antibacterial

susceptibility testing) were performed on the stool or swab samples at a central laboratory.

Subjects were also contacted every month by phone to assess for CDI recurrence. A stool

sample was to be collected at the time of a new episode of diarrhea and tested for toxigenic *C.*

*difficile* locally at the central laboratory. Serum samples were collected during the scheduled
and unscheduled visits per the Extended Follow-up Period ( `“` extension phase `”` ) study flow

chart; such sera were used for post-infusion PK assessment of MK-3415 and MK-6072 as well

as measuring levels of ADA and endogenous anti-toxin A and anti-toxin B antibodies. Safety

was assessed through the end of the 12-month follow-up period for any AEs with an outcome

of death as well as any SAEs considered to be related to the study infusion. The extension

phase did not contribute to the protocol primary, secondary or exploratory objectives. Due to

the small number of subjects in the extension phase, subjects were evaluated for these

endpoints separately.

**Figure 1: Trial design for protocols 001 and 002**

The daily count of loose stools (defined as Type 5 through Type 7 on the Bristol Stool Chart) was

recorded by the subject (or designee) by the use of a stool count log. The study personnel were to

contact the subject every day through Day 14 for loose stool counts, body temperature, and

compliance with standard of care (SoC) medications and to ensure they are being recorded on the log.

Thereafter, study personnel was to contact the subject twice weekly Week 3 through Week 12. The

information communicated by the subject during the contact was to be recorded in the source

documentation

***Study Participants***

Subjects with confirmed CDI were eligible for enrolment, including those with multiple previous

episodes of CDI. Diagnosis of the baseline episode required a positive stool test for toxigenic *C. difficile*

within 7 days prior to study infusion. All subjects were required to be receiving oral standard of care

antibiotic therapy for the presenting episode of CDI.

**Pertinent inclusion criteria**

  - Subject must be 18 years of age or older.

  - Subject has a confirmed diagnosis *of C. difficile* infection (CDI) as defined by:

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 29/110


-----

a. Diarrhoea (passage of 3 or more loose stools in 24 or fewer hours)

and

b. A positive stool test for toxigenic *C. difficile* from a stool samples collected no more than

7 days before the study infusion (allowed stool test methods and kits are listed in

respective study protocols)

Diarrhoea is not required to be present on the day of infusion.

  - Subject must be receiving or planning to receive a 10- to 14-day course of standard of care

therapy for CDI. A subject who is planning to initiate standard of care therapy on the same day

as the infusion is eligible for participation. The first dose of standard of care therapy must have

been administered prior to or within a few hours following the infusion.

**Pertinent exclusion criteria**

  - Subject with an uncontrolled chronic diarrheal illness such as, but not limited to, uncontrolled

ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease or with a condition such that their normal 24–hour bowel

movement habit is 3 or more loose stools as defined by the Bristol Stool Chart Types 5, 6, or

7. Subjects with a history of inflammatory bowel disease who are controlled (i.e., had no

recent active diarrhoea prior to current *C. difficile* episode at study entry) may be enrolled if in

the opinion of the investigator the symptoms are more likely due to CDI than a flare of the

inflammatory bowel disease.

  - Subject with a planned surgery for CDI within 24 hours.

  - Subject plans to take medications which are given to decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis, such

as loperamide (Imodium), or diphenoxylate hydrochloride/atropine sulfate (Lomotil), at any

time during the 14 days following infusion. Subjects receiving opioid medications at the onset

of diarrhoea may be included if they are expected to be on stable doses of these medications,

or there is anticipation of a dose decrease or cessation of their use.

  - Subject plans to take the probiotic *Saccharomyces boulardii* or plans to receive faecal

transplantation therapy, or any other therapies that have been demonstrated to decrease CDI

recurrence at any time following infusion (Day 1) and through the completion of the 12-Week

study period all such therapies would be allowed if recurrence occurs after study

therapy/standard of care has completed.

***Treatments***

Patients were randomised to receive at Day 1, a single infusion of:

  - Actoxumab 10 mg/kg (Study P001 only)

  - Bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg

  - Actoxumab + bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg each

  - Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride)

**Concomitant medications**

In both studies, all subjects were required to receive standard of care antibiotic therapy for treatment

of the CDI episode. The standard of care antibiotic was oral metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

In addition, subjects receiving vancomycin or fidaxomicin could also receive IV metronidazole.

Medication intended to decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis and other therapies aiming to decrease CDI

recurrence were forbidden.

***Objectives***

The *primary efficacy* objectives of the studies were to assess the following:

  - To determine if treatment with a single infusion actoxumab + bezlotoxumab with standard of

care therapy and the separate individual mAb therapy (actoxumab or bezlotoxumab) decreases

the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over a period of 12 weeks as compared to

treatment with a single infusion of placebo with standard of care therapy.

In addition, the following objective was a primary objective in Study P001 and a secondary objective in

Study P002:

  - To determine if treatment with a single infusion of actoxumab +bezlotoxumab with standard of

care therapy decreases the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over a period of 12

weeks as compared to treatment with a single infusion of individual mAb therapy (actoxumab

or bezlotoxumab) with standard of care therapy.

Of note, in Study P001 the actoxumab arm was dropped at the time of the interim analysis; therefore

only the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab and bezlotoxumab treatment groups were assessed for these

objectives.

The *secondary objectives* were defined as follows:

  - To evaluate, in the subset of subjects who achieve a clinical cure for the baseline CDI episode,

if treatment with a single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy decreases the

proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over a period of 12 weeks as compared to

treatment with a single infusion of placebo and standard of care therapy;

  - To determine the proportion of subjects who achieve global cure in the treatment group

receiving a single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy as compared to the treatment

group receiving a single placebo infusion with standard of care therapy, and

  - To evaluate if treatment with a single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy decreases

the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence over a period of 12 weeks as compared to

treatment with a single infusion of placebo and standard of care therapy in the following

subgroups:

a. Subjects with or without a history of CDI in the 6 months prior to enrolment

b. Subjects infected with or without the BI/NAP1/027 strain of *C. difficile* at study entry

c. Subjects infected with or without an epidemic strain of *C. difficile* at study entry

d. Subjects with or without a clinically severe *C. difficile* infection at study entry

e. Subjects <65 years of age or ≥ 65 years of age at study entry

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 31/110


-----

f. Subjects with or without compromised immunity at study entry

The *exploratory efficacy* objectives of both trials were focused on the comparison of actoxumab +

bezlotoxumab versus placebo. However, these secondary efficacy objectives may also include the

individual monoclonal antibody treatment groups i.e. actoxumab or bezlotoxumab provided one (or

both) of these regimens are not found to be different from actoxumab + bezlotoxumab and

demonstrate superiority versus placebo. Thus the secondary objectives are defined as follows:

  - To evaluate the proportion of subjects with clinical cure in the treatment group receiving a

single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy as compared to the treatment group

receiving a single placebo infusion with standard of care therapy

  - To determine if treatment with a single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy reduces

the time to resolution of the initial CDI episode as compared to treatment with a single placebo

infusion with standard of care therapy

  - To assess the impact of treatment with a single infusion of mAb or placebo with standard of

care therapy on the median number of loose stools per day for the initial CDI episode (day

after infusion [Day 2] through Day 14)

  - To evaluate the proportion of subjects whose elevated baseline WBC (>10,000 cells/mm3)

decreases to ≤ 10,000 cells/mm3 by Day 4 or Day 11 in the treatment group receiving a single

infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy as compared to the treatment group receiving a

single placebo infusion with standard of care therapy

  - To evaluate the proportion of subjects whose elevated baseline body temperature ( ≥ 101.0° F

[38.4° C]) decreases to <101° F [38.4° C] by Day 4 or Day 11 in the treatment group

receiving a single infusion of mAb with standard of care therapy as compared to the treatment

group receiving a single placebo infusion with standard of care therapy.

***Outcomes/endpoints***

**Primary endpoint**

  - CDI recurrence: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with CDI

recurrence assessed through the Week 12 (Day 85 ± 5 days) of the primary study period. CDI

recurrence was defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhoea (3 or more loose

stools in 24 or fewer hours) associated with a positive local or central lab stool test for

toxigenic *C. difficile* following clinical cure of the initial CDI episode. Subjects not meeting the

clinical cure endpoint were not assessable for the CDI recurrence endpoint and thus were

considered as not having CDI recurrence.

The measurement of clinical and laboratory variables supported the evaluation of the primary

endpoint. Those variables were (1) diarrhoea, (2) positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile from the

local or the central laboratory, and (3) the type and duration of standard of care antibiotic therapy.

Diarrhoea was defined as 3 or more loose stools in 24 hours. Loose stools were defined as Bristol

Types 5, 6, and/or 7. Acceptable diagnostic methods in the assessment of subjects who experience

new episodes of diarrhoea while on study were listed in the protocol.

**Secondary endpoints**

  - *CDI recurrence in pre-specified subgroups*

These assessments used the same definition for CDI recurrence as defined for the primary

endpoint, but were limited to the following subsets of subjects:

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 32/110


-----

1) subset of subjects with clinical cure of the baseline CDI episode and 2) other subgroups

taking into account hospitalisation status, standard of care therapy, C. difficile strain: 027

ribotype versus non-027 ribotype, any epidemic *C. difficile* strain: 027, 014, 002, 001, 106, or

020 ribotypes versus non-epidemic ribotypes, hypervirulent strain of *C. difficile* (ribotypes 027,

078, or 244) versus non-hypervirulent strain, prior history of CDI i.e. presence versus absence

of prior CDI episode within the 6 months prior to enrolment, age i.e.<65 years versus ≥ 65

years, CDI severity, and compromised immunity.

CDI severity was defined as diarrhoea and a score of ≥ 2 points based on the presence of 1 or

more of the following: 1) age >60 years old (1 point); 2) body temperature >38.3°C (>100°F)

(1 point); 3) albumin level ˂2.5 mg/Dl (1 point); 4) peripheral WBC count >15,000 cells/mm3

within 48 hours (1 point); 5) endoscopic evidence of pseudomembranous colitis (2 points); and

6) treatment in ICU (2 points). Since diarrhoea was not required to be present on the day of

infusion, all subjects were assumed to have had diarrhoea at some point during the baseline

episode of CDI.

  - *Global cure* : Proportion of subjects with global cure defined as clinical cure of the baseline CDI

episode and no CDI recurrence through Week 12.

**Exploratory endpoints**

  - *Clinical cure* : Proportion of subjects with clinical cure defined as subject received ≤ 14 day

regimen of standard of care therapy and the subject had no diarrhoea ( ≤ 2 loose stools per 24

hours) for two consecutive days following completion of standard of care therapy for the

baseline CDI episode. Subjects requiring >14 day regimen of standard of care therapy for the

baseline CDI episode were considered a failure for the clinical cure endpoint.

  - *Time to CDI recurrence* . The start date of CDI recurrence was the first date of the new episode

of diarrhoea.

  - *Resolution of Initial CDI Episode* defined as the time from randomisation to the end of

diarrhoea during the initial CDI episode (i.e., time to first of two consecutive days with ≤ 2

loose stools). Patients will be censored at end of SOC window ( ≤ 14 days) for this endpoint.

  - *Stool Counts during Initial CDI Episode* : Defined as the daily number of loose stools reported

on the patient stool log. Summary statistics including the median will be provided by study day

starting from the day after infusion (Day 2) through Study Day 14.

  - *WBC on Days 4 and 11* : Defined as the proportion of patients whose elevated baseline WBC

(>10,000 cells/mm3) decreases to ≤ 10,000 cells/mm3 by Day 4 or Day 11.

  - *Elevated body temperature on Days 4 and 11* : Defined as the proportion of patients whose

elevated baseline body temperature ( ≥ 101.0° F [38.4° C]) decreases to <101.0° F [38.4° C]

by Day 4 or Day 11.

  - *Proportion of patients with diarrhoea recurrence* defined as the development of a new episode

of diarrhoea (3 or more loose stools in 24 or fewer hours) whether or not a positive stool test

for toxigenic C. difficile is available following clinical cure of the initial CDI episode.

***Sample size***

Based on data from phase 2 and literature recurrence of CDI was expected for about 7 to 10% patients

on MK-3145A, while for patients on SOC therapy the incidence of CDI recurrence was assumed to be

between 14.3% and 25%. It was calculated that with 400 patients per group, a chi-square test at a 1
Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 33/110


-----

sided alpha of 0.025 provides approximately 95% power to detect the following differences in the

incidence of CDI recurrence between monoclonal antibody therapy and placebo: 8% vs. 16.3%, 9% vs.

17.6% or 10% vs. 18.9%. These calculations resulted in 1600 patients to be initially included into

study P001 and 1200 patients to be included into study P002.

***Randomisation***

Patients in study P001 were initially randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (MK-3415A : MK-3415 : MK-6072 :

placebo). Following the planned interim analysis the eDMC recommended to discontinue the MK-3415

arm due to safety concerns. Thus following the interim analysis, subjects were randomized using a

1:1:1 ratio (MK-6072, MK-3415A : placebo). In study P002 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio

(MK-3415A : MK-6072 : placebo).

In both studies randomization was stratified according to SoC (metronidazole, vancomycin,

fidaxomicin) and hospitalization status (inpatient, outpatient). In each study at least 20% of the total

population was required to be from the vancomycin stratum. Randomisation was performed via an

Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).

***Blinding (masking)***

According protocol, an unblinded pharmacist at each study centre was responsible to prepare and

account for the monoclonal antibodies (MK-3415 (study P001), MK-6072 or MK-3415A) and placebo

according to pre-specified guidelines provided by the Applicant. The unblinded pharmacist was not

involved in any evaluations for the subject. Due to slight differences in appearance for monoclonal

antibody solutions compared to normal saline solutions (placebo) all infusion bags were to be covered

in an opaque sleeve to ensure that blinded study personnel and subjects remained blinded to clinical

material assignment. The IV line (through which the infusion was administered) did not require

blinding as the difference between clinical materials was not visually distinguishable within the tubing.

***Statistical methods***

Efficacy analyses were performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) of all randomized patients excluding

patients who

  - failed to receive infusion of study medication

  - had a lack of a positive local stool test for toxigenic *C. difficile*

  - failed to receive protocol defined standard of care therapy within a 1 day window of the

infusion

Miettinen and Nurminen’s method [Miettinen O, Nurminen M: Comparative analysis of two rates. Stat.

Med., 4, 213-226 (1985)] applying the same strata as for randomisation was used to compare the

proportion of patients with CDI recurrence between treatment groups. For this analysis patients

lacking clinical cure or any post randomization endpoint data subsequent to infusion were considered

as having no CDI recurrence. In patients with clinical cure who were lost to follow up, the last available

stool records was used to assess for CDI recurrence.

According protocols, Study P001 and Study P002 respectively were considered successful, if the

combined monoclonal antibody treatment (MK-3415A) was statistically superior when compared to

placebo. To control the type I error (at 0.025, 1-sided) the following strategies were applied:

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 34/110


-----

  - Study P001 (Amendment 3): Treatment comparisons were grouped into two families. In Family

2, individual monoclonal antibody therapies (MK-3415 and MK-6072) were compared

separately to the combined monoclonal antibody therapy (MK-3415A). A Dunnett procedure

was to be applied for the comparison of each of the two monotherapies to the combination

therapy. A Haybittle-Peto boundary (spending 0.0001 at interim) was planned to account for

the interim analysis. In Family 1, the various active monoclonal antibody therapies (MK-3415,

MK-6072, and MK-3415A) were compared separately to placebo. An alpha of 0.0125 (1-sided)

was allocated to each of the two hypothesis families in order to provide strong control of the

studywise Type 1 error at 0.025 (1-sided) for the primary endpoint of CDI recurrence. The

comparisons of interest and the associated p-value cut-offs for declaring statistical significance

at the final analyses were as follows:

|Comparison|p-value cut-off (1-sided)|
|---|---|
|MK-3415A versus MK-6072|0.0066|
|MK-3415A versus placebo|0.0125|
|MK-6072 versus placebo|0.0125 (only if MK-3415A vs. placebo significant)|



  - Study P002: First MK-3415A was compared to placebo. Only in case of a p-value < 0.025 (1
sided) MK-6072 was to be compared to placebo (at alpha = 0.025, 1-sided).

The same analysis method as for the primary endpoint was used to analyse dichotomous secondary

and exploratory endpoints. Time to event outcomes (e.g. time to CDI recurrence) was compared

between treatment groups by means of the stratified log-rank test.

In general treatment effects were described by means of point estimates including the corresponding

2-sided) 95% confidence intervals.

To assess the consistency of the treatment effect across various subgroups, the estimate of the

between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for the primary and secondary endpoints

(CDI recurrence and Global Cure) were estimated within each category for the subgroups. Amongst

others the primary endpoint was assessed among subjects who attained clinical cure.

Interim analysis

For Study P001 one interim efficacy analysis was planned when the first 640 enrolled patients (40% of

planned total) had completed week 12 or discontinued prior to week 12 in order to evaluate the

individual monoclonal antibody therapies (MK-3415 or MK-6072) relative to the combined monoclonal

antibody therapy (MK-3415A). In case of sufficient evidence of superiority for MK-3415A over either

MK-3415 or MK-6072, further enrolment in one or both of these study treatment groups should be

stopped. It was not planned to stop the trial for overwhelming efficacy at interim. The interim analysis

was conducted by an external statistician with no other responsibilities with respect to study P001.

Following the interim analysis further enrolment into the MK-3415 group of study P001 was stopped

(for safety reason) due to a recommendation by the eDMC.

There was no interim analysis for study P002 (neither planned nor performed).

**Conduct of the study**

***Study P001***

There were 3 general and one local amendment to the protocol. Amendment 1 and 2 were finalised

and approved before any subjects were enrolled into the study. Amendment No.3 was implemented

after enrolment of subjects had commenced and before database lock and unblinding. Amendment

No. 4 was a local country amendment. The changes were subsequently added to Amendment No. 3,

which applied to all sites in all countries.

The percentage of subjects who had at least one major protocol deviation was high, among the 631

(43%) treated subjects who were assessed as having a major protocol deviation, 277 (19.6%) of the

1412 treated subjects had at least one major protocol deviation that could substantially affect the

primary efficacy endpoint(s). Sixteen of these subjects were removed from the FAS population. An

additional 261 subjects were removed from the PP analysis but retained in the FAS population.

***Study P002***

There was 1 general and one local amendment to the protocol. Amendment No. 1 was implemented

after enrolment of subjects had commenced, before database lock and unblinding. Amendment No. 2

was a local country amendment.

A relative high number of subjects (37.1 %) had at least one or more major protocol deviation. Among

the 433 treated subjects who were assessed as having a major protocol deviation, 197 (16.9%) of the

1168 treated subjects had at least one major protocol deviation that could substantially affect the

primary efficacy endpoint(s). Five (5) of these subjects were removed from the FAS population. An

additional 192 subjects were removed from the PP analysis but retained in the FAS population.

P002 had two planned DBLs with the first one (13-Apr-2015) containing all of the 12-week main study

data as well as data from the completed visits for the extension phase. There were major protocol

deviations noted after the first database lock but before the second database lock (performed to

account for the extension phase data) and occurring months after the first database lock. None of

these protocol deviations excluded subjects from an analysis. None of the evaluability assessments

changed nor did any of the efficacy database endpoints change between the first and second database

locks. Furthermore, the efficacy assessments through Week 12 did not change from the first database

lock to the second database lock, with the exception that the amount of available microbiological strain

typing data increased between the first and second database locks.

Key characteristics relating to this baseline CDI episode, include onset of the episode relative to the

day of study medication administration, loose stool count which confirmed subjects met the protocol

definition of diarrhoea, and the type of test used at the local laboratory to confirm the presence of

toxigenic C. difficile in stool.

“Baseline” was defined as the day on which the study medication was administered, and was also

identical / synonymous with Day 1. The date of onset of the baseline CDI episode recorded in the case

report form may have been interpreted differently across sites. This was generally interpreted as the

date symptoms began, but, in some cases, it was the date a patient presented to their physician, or

the date of the diagnosis. Hence, the date was obtained from subject recall or based on documentation

in hospital records.

The diagnosis of CDI also required a positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile from a stool sample

collected no more than 7 days before study infusion. The permitted methods included cell cytotoxicity

assay, anaerobic culture with toxin detection or strain typing, and several commercial test kits. All

acceptable methodologies had a specificity of at least 94% and had the capacity to detect the presence

of toxin B or the ability to produce toxin B (tcdB gene).

The number and proportion of subjects with elevated temperature (defined as ≥ 38.4 `°` C/101.0 `°` F) or

elevated WBC count (defined as >10,000 cells/mm3) at the time of study entry were As previously

noted, the study design allowed subjects to enrol any time during treatment with the standard of care

antibiotic, provided that a stool test obtained within the 7 days prior to administration of the study

medication was positive for toxigenic C. difficile. Hence, the results for WBC counts and elevated

temperature may not reflect what was present at the time of CDI diagnosis.

Pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, ileus, or required a colectomy or other

surgery due to complications of CDI were considered signs of “severe” or “severe, complicated” CDI

during the baseline CDI episode.

***Study P001***

**Table 7: Subjects characteristics –CDI diagnosis (FAS Population)**

Over one-quarter (27.7%) of subjects in the FAS population had an elevated WBC count at baseline,

while only 7 subjects (0.5%) had elevated temperature. In general, the proportion of subjects with

elevated WBCs or temperature was similar across treatment groups.

***Standard of care treatment***

The oral standard of care therapy at the time of randomization was one of the stratification variables.

It should be noted that a subject may have received an oral standard of care antibiotic either prior to

or after trial entry and which differed from that at the time of stratification. A switch in standard of

care antibiotic was permitted during the trial if the subject had received at least 3 days of the baseline

standard of care therapy and met at least one of the 3 following conditions: (1) continued diarrhoea,

(2) presence of ileus, or (3) a body temperature >38.3ºC (>100.9ºF) and peripheral WBC count

>15,000 cells/mm3. Additionally, a switch was permitted at any time for emergence of an AE due to

the standard of care therapy.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 52/110


-----

In general, the proportion of subjects for the majority of these prognostic risk factors was balanced

across treatment groups; however, there were some notable imbalances. The MK-6072 group had a

slightly lower percentage of subjects in the ≥ 75 years age category: 25.6% vs 30.1% placebo group.

The CDI episode at the time of study entry was classified as healthcare facility associated for 52.1% of

subjects. Healthcare facility associated refers to those subjects who were in the hospital (or other

health care facility, including long term care facility) at the time of onset, or were at home at the time

of onset but had been in a healthcare facility within the previous 3 months. In general, the

classification of the CDI episode was similar across the treatment groups.

Systemic antibiotic use, PPI use, use of a nasogastric tube, and whether the subject had an

appendectomy at any time prior to study entry are considered as additional CDI risk factors. A slightly

higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group reported prior systemic antibiotic use than in the

other treatment groups (54.9% in the placebo group compared to 51.4%, 51.3%, and 47.2%, for the

MK-3415A, MK-3415, and MK-6072 groups, respectively). Prior use of PPIs was generally balanced

across treatment groups. Only 4.2% of subjects had a nasogastric tube in place during the month prior

to onset of the baseline episode, and the prior presence of a nasogastric tube was generally similar

across the treatment groups. Among the 358 subjects for whom a response was given, approximately

half had an appendectomy; a numerically higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group had an

appendectomy than in the other treatment groups (17.2% in the placebo group compared to 15.4%,

1.7%, and 11.7%, for the MK-3415A, MK-3415, and MK-6072 groups, respectively).

The proportion of subjects for the majority of these prognostic risk factors was balanced across

treatment groups.

The CDI episode at the time of study entry was classified as healthcare facility associated for 61.2% of

subjects. In general, the distribution of CDI episode classifications was generally similar across the

treatment groups.

Prior use of a systemic antibiotic or a PPI was recorded for approximately half of the subjects in the

FAS population (59.1% for prior systemic antibiotic use; 48.0% for prior PPI use). The proportion of

subjects with prior systemic antibiotic use was similar among the treatment groups. The proportion of

subjects with prior use of PPIs was slightly higher in the MK-6072 group (50.6%) as compared to the

placebo group and the MK-3415A group (46.6% and 46.7%, respectively). Only 4.9% of subjects had

a nasogastric tube in place during the month prior to onset of the baseline episode; the proportion of

such patients was slightly lower in the MK-6072 group (3.8%) as compared to the MK-3415A group

(5.4%) and placebo group (5.6%).

  - **CDI recurrence**

**Table 20: Analysis of the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence (FAS Population)**

A lower proportion of subjects had CDI recurrence in the MK-6072 group (17.4%) as compared to the

placebo group (27.6%). The estimated difference between the MK-6072 group and the placebo group,

adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, was -10.1%

(95% CI: -15.9% to -4.3%, one-sided p = 0.0003). Given the p-value cut off of 0.0125, these results

are considered statistically significant. Though the CDI recurrence rate in the MK-3415A group was

slightly lower than the CDI recurrence rate in the MK-6072 group, this difference was not statistically

significant (one sided p = 0.2997).

A supportive analysis of CDI recurrence among subjects in the PP population was also performed.

Overall, results were similar to those observed among the FAS population. CDI recurrence rates among

subjects in the PP population were slightly higher than those observed in the FAS population across all

treatment groups. Among subjects in the PP population, the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence

was lower among subjects receiving MK-6072 (19.0%) as compared to that among subjects receiving

placebo (31.4%). The estimated differences between the MK-6072 group versus the placebo group,

adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, were -12.4%

(95% CI: -21.3% to -8.0%). Treatment with a single infusion of MK-6072 given with standard of care

antibiotic therapy decreases the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence as compared with a single

infusion of placebo given with standard of care antibiotic therapy among subjects in the PP population

(one-sided p = 0.0002, respectively).

The second and final comparison in the sequential testing plan for the primary endpoint was the

comparison of the MK-6072 treatment group to the placebo treatment group using a one-sided p-value

cut off of 0.025. A lower proportion of subjects had CDI recurrence in the MK-6072 group (15.7%) as

compared to the placebo group (25.7%). The estimated difference between the MK-6072 group and

the placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care

therapy, was -9.9% (95% CI: -15.5% to -4.3%, one-sided p = 0.0003). Given the p-value cut off of

0.025, these results are considered statistically significant.

A secondary objective of this study was to compare the single monoclonal antibody treatment group

(MK-6072) to the combined monoclonal antibody treatment group (MK-3415A) with respect to the

proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence. There was no statistical difference between MK-3415A and

MK-6072 with respect to the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence.

A supportive analysis of CDI recurrence among subjects in the PP population was also performed.

Overall, results were similar to those observed among the FAS population. CDI recurrence rates

among subjects in the PP population were slightly higher than those observed in the FAS population

across all treatment groups. Among subjects in the PP population, the proportions of subjects with CDI

recurrence was lower among subjects receiving MK-3415A (16.0%) and MK-6072 (16.6%) as

compared to that among subjects receiving placebo (29.4%). The estimated differences between the

MK-3415A group and the MK-6072 group versus the placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors

of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, were 13.7% (95% CI: -20.2% to -7.3%) and

A lower proportion of subjects achieved clinical cure of the baseline episode in the MK-6072 (77.5%)

(and MK-3415A [74.7%]) treatment groups as compared to the placebo group (82.8%). The estimated

difference between the MK-6072 treatment group and the placebo group, adjusted for stratification

factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, was -5.3% (95% CI: -10.9% to 0.3%,

one sided p= 0.9679). The estimated difference between the MK-3415A treatment group and the

placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy,

was -8.2% (95% CI: -13.9% to -2.4%, one sided p= 0.9973). Thus, there was not only no evidence

that treatment with MK-3415A or MK-6072 provided additional benefit over standard of care antibiotic

alone for clinical cure of the baseline episode; the results suggest a more favourable outcome for

clinical cure in the placebo group.

The data suggested that treatment with MK-6072 (and 3415A) appeared to be associated with CDI

recurrences of less severity (as evidenced by lower maximum number of loose stool counts) and

shorter duration (as evidenced by the time to resolution of the new episode). The majority of subjects

on MK-6072 (and MK-3415A) that had a CDI recurrence resolved their episode within 2 days of the

start of the recurrent episode (61.2% and 63.9%) as compared with a smaller proportion of placebo

subjects (47.7%).

***Study P002***

  - **Clinical cure**

**Table 31: Analysis of the proportion of subjects with clinical cure (FAS Set Population)**

For the MK-6072 treatment group, the clinical cure rate was higher (82.5%) than in the placebo group.

The estimated difference between the clinical cure rates for the MK-6072 treatment group and the

placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy,

was 4.8% (95% CI: -0.9% to 10.4%, one sided p= 0.0481). A lower proportion of subjects (72.3%) in

the MK-3415A group achieved clinical cure of the baseline episode as compared to the placebo group

(77.8%). The estimated difference between the clinical cure rates for the MK-3415A treatment group

and the placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care

therapy, was -5.5% (95% CI: -11.6% to 0.6%, one sided p= 0.9605). As such, there was no evidence

to suggest that treatment with MK-3415A or MK-6072 provided additional benefit over standard of care

antibiotic alone for the clinical cure of the baseline episode.

  - **Diagnosis and severity of new CDI episode**

A total of 217 subjects in the FAS population had a CDI recurrence episode during the 12- week follow
up period. Treatment with MK-3415A and MK-6072 appeared to be associated with CDI recurrences of

less severity (as evidenced by the lower maximum number of loose stool counts) and shorter durations

(as evidenced by the time to resolution of the new episode) than the initial CDI episode. A higher

proportion of subjects treated with MK-3415A (62.1%) or MK-6072 (56.5%) who experienced a CDI

recurrence resolved this episode within 2 days of the start of the recurrent episode, as compared with

the proportion of placebo subjects (47.4%).

Among subjects for whom ribotype data were available for both their baseline CDI episode and their

recurrent episode, approximately 45.0% had the identical ribotype result for both CDI episodes.

Only a small number of the CDI recurrence episodes were severe as assessed by a Zar score ≥ 2 (23

subjects, 10.5% overall). The proportion of severe cases was similar among the MK-3415A, MK-6072,

and placebo groups (12.1%, 8.1%, and 11.3%, respectively.

No subjects had toxic megacolon or a colectomy, and 2 subjects (1 each in the MK-3415A and placebo

groups) died within 30 days following onset of the CDI recurrence.

The proportion of subjects who received such CDI treatment was higher in the placebo group (71.1%)

as compared to the MK-3415A and MK-6072 groups (63.8% and 58.1%, respectively.

There were no formal statistical analyses conducted for the outcome data collected in these subjects

after the end of the main study.

In total, three additional subjects experienced a CDI recurrence during the extension phase of the

study (2 subjects from the MK-3415A group and 1 subject from the placebo group). These three

events occurred between Months 9 and 12 and occurred (by definition) among subjects who were

global cures in the main study

There were an additional 4 subjects who are presumed to have had a recurrence during the extension

study (1 subject in the MK-3415A group; 1 subject in the MK-6072 group; 2 subjects in the placebo

group). These 4 subjects had a positive stool test for toxigenic *C. difficile* at an unscheduled visit,

however loose stool counts were not recorded.

**Clinical studies in special populations**

**Age**

Geriatric patients ( ≥ 65 years) comprised over half (51%) of the analysis population in the Phase 3

trials and included a substantial number (29%) of patients ≥ 75 years of age.

CDI recurrence rates were similar in elderly ( ≥ 65, 15%), very elderly ( ≥ 75, 16%), and non-elderly (<

65, 18%) patients treated with 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab.

**Race**

CDI recurrence rates were similar in white (17%) patients versus all other races (15%) treated with 10

mg/kg bezlotoxumab.

**Renal impairment**

Renal impairment was defined as serum creatinine - 1.5 mg/dL at study entry. A lower proportion of

subjects with renal impairment experienced a CDI recurrence in the bezlotoxumab group (13.8%,

17/123) as compared to the placebo group (22.7%); the adjusted difference was -8.9% (95% CI: 
19.1% to 1.0%). The 95% CI was wide, reflecting the small size of the study population with renal

impairment.

CDI recurrence rates were similar regardless of renal function in patients treated with 10 mg/kg

bezlotoxumab.

**Hepatic impairment**

Hepatic impairment was defined as having two or more of the following at study entry: (a) albumin

<3.1 g/dL, (b) ALT >2X ULN, (c) total bilirubin >1.3X ULN, or (d) mild, moderate or severe liver

disease (as reported in the Charlson Comorbidity Index). Among subjects with hepatic impairment,

CDI recurrence rates were 12.2% (6/49) in the bezlotoxumab group versus 11.4% (5/44) in the

placebo group; the adjusted difference was -0.9% (95% CI: -13.6% to 14.8%). The small difference

was driven by the low CDI recurrence rate in the placebo arm. While CDI recurrence rate remained low

in the bezlotoxumab arm of the hepatic insufficiency subgroup, the rate in the placebo arm was

substantially lower than that seen in the overall placebo population (26.6%).

**Presence of comorbid conditions**

The effect of comorbid conditions at the time of study entry as assessed in the Charlson Comorbidity

Index was evaluated.

CDI recurrence rates were similar in patients with Charlson Comorbidity Index - 3 (14%) or < 3

(18%).

***Supportive studies***

Two phase 2 studies (Study P018 and Study P017) either related to monotherapy with actoxumab

(Study CA-CDA1-05-02 (Protocol 018)) or combination therapy with actoxumab and bezlotuxumab

(Protocol 0017) were included in the application. Since these studies do not contribute to the efficacy

evaluation of bezlotuxumab, they are not included in the overview.
#### **2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy **

***Design and conduct of clinical studies***

Two similar Phase 3 studies (Study P001 and Study P002) were submitted to support the efficacy of

bezlotoxumab (MK-6072) for the prevention of CDI recurrence. The studies were designed to evaluate

two different monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab (MK-3415), directed against *C. difficile* toxin A,

bezlotuxumab, directed against *C. difficile* toxin B as well as the combination of the two antibodies

(MK-3415A). However based on the results of the clinical studies, the Applicant pursues a MAA for

bezlotoxumab only. The two studies included a total of 810 randomised subjects in the bezlotoxumab

group and 803 randomised subjects in the placebo group. The aim of the studies was to demonstrate

superiority of bezlotoxumab plus standard-of-care antibiotics versus placebo plus standard of care

antibiotics in adult subjects with CDI based on the difference in recurrence rates of CDI during a time

period of 12 weeks.

The study participants are subjects with confirmed CDI, including those with multiple previous episodes

of CDI. However, the majority of the enrolled patients did not have a past history of CDI

(approximately 65%). The definition of CDI includes laboratory confirmation of toxigenic *C. difficile*

infection. This describes an appropriate target population.

Standard of Care (SoC) antibiotic for the treatment of the baseline episode of CDI was at the discretion

of the treating physician. Although the protocol referenced the IDSA/SHEA guidelines regarding the

choice of SoC antibiotic, the protocols did not mandate that these guidelines be followed. It was

anticipated that North American sites would likely follow the IDSA/SHEA guidelines regarding the

choice of SoC antibiotic, while the EU sites would likely follow the ESCMID guidelines. Although the

treatment recommendations regarding which SoC antibiotics to use for mild-moderate, severe, and

severe-complicated CDI in these two sets of guidelines were generally similar, the Phase 3 protocols

allowed flexibility in the choice of doses to account for some differences in local practices, with caveat

that the total daily dose and duration of treatment was in accordance with the protocols.

Patients were randomised to receive a single infusion 10 mg/kg infusion of bezlotoxumab or

actoxumab or placebo, or actoxumab + bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg each. No dose response studies were

performed. The dose for the early development program was based on non-clinical data. The 10 mg/kg

dose selected for the Phase 3 studies is based on data derived from pre-clinical studies, PK-trials in

healthy subjects and the Phase 2 clinical trials.

The primary endpoint was CDI recurrence, defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhoea

(3 or more loose stools in 24 or fewer hours) associated with a positive local or central lab stool test

for toxigenic *C. difficile* following clinical cure of the initial CDI episode. Subjects not meeting the

clinical cure endpoint were not assessable for the CDI recurrence endpoint and were considered as not

having CDI recurrence.

Secondary endpoints included CDI recurrence in a subset of the FAS population who achieved clinical

cure, global cure (clinical cure of the baseline episode and no CDI recurrence) and CDI recurrence in

Assessment report

-----

some chosen subgroups (i.e., with/without history of CDI in the 6 months prior to enrolment, infection

with/without 027 strain, with/without hypervirulent strain, with/without clinically severe CDI at study

entry, <65 years and ≥ 65 years and with/without compromised immunity). Several exploratory

endpoints were also examined.

As part of CDI diagnosis subjects were required to have diarrhoea, defined as at least 3 bowel

movements with loose stools (Bristol Stool Charts types 5-7) within a 24-hours period. The Applicant

provided evidence that the Bristol Stool Chart is widely used as a tool for CDI diagnostic. The definition

for diarrhoea is consistent with the European Society of Clinical Microbiology CDI Treatment Guidance.

In the context of the clinical development program the Bristol Stool Form Chart was validated in a pilot

study, including patients from 48 to 78 years of age. The patients were to record a stool count log and

were contacted every day through Day 14 by study personnel (less frequently after Day 14). The

Applicant detailed the measures performed to ensure that the recall bias was minimised and diarrhoea

reporting was appropriate. Altogether less than 1% of subjects had < 3 loose stools at qualification or

had a response of ‘unknown’ or ‘missing.

CDI severity was defined on basis of data from Zar *et al.* (Clin Infect Disease 2007:45(3):302-7).

There is some evidence from literature that the Zar Score is comparable to the CDI severity criteria

recommended by the IDSA/SHEA and there is consensus that both scores appropriately measure CDI

severity (Gomez-Simmonds *et al.,* 2014).

No literature reports in which a cohort of CDI patients were simultaneously assessed for severity based

on the Zar scale and the ESCMID criteria are available, however assessments of CDI patient cohorts

using the IDSA/SHEA and ESCMID severity criteria have been reported from two groups

(Starzengruber *et al.,* 2014 and Khanafer *et al.,* 2016); both authors comment that the ESCMID

definition might lead to a overestimation of severe CDI in their patient collective.

The proportion of P001 and P002 subjects with severe CDI is lower than those described in previously

published reports on hospitalized CDI patients. The Applicant relates this finding to the study design

*e.g.* many patients were enrolled in the trials after initiation of standard of care (SoC) antibiotic

therapy and severity was assessed at the time of randomization into the study. This explanation is

accepted.

Analyses of efficacy in patients with Zar Score ≥ 3 vs. patients with Zar Score < 3 and efficacy in

patients with severe CDI according to the ESCMID definition were provided:

a) Subjects with Zar Score > 3 showed regarding CDI recurrence among clinical cure subset, Global

Cure and Clinical Cure, favourable results in the placebo group, albeit not statistically significant.

b) The analysis of the subgroup of patients with severe CDI or at increased risk of developing severe

CDI according to the ESCMID definition suggested that no effect of bezlotoxumab was seen in patients

with “no risk” or “unknown risk” (except for Global Cure).

It is acknowledged that to date the Zar scale is an appropriate tool to measure CDI severity; and that

the scale defines severe CDI based on a score > 2. The Zar score correlates with severity criteria

recommended by the IDSA/SHEA. Although the observed efficacy outcome is to some extent

dependent on the definition of CDI, it is accepted that efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with

severe CDI (Zar Score >2).

However, it is observed that a limited number of patients having a severe type of CDI or harbouring

prognostic risk factors of developing severe CDI were included in the FAS population. Around 80% of

the patients had Zar score < 2, indicating a less severe CDI. The design of the studies might possibly

have influenced the number of patients with e.g. fever and/or elevated WBC count (factors that are

included in the Zar scale) as it was allowed to start SoC therapy before entering the study and

receiving bezlotoxumab. It is also acknowledged, that in addition to the rating of the Zar score, there

were patients included who were immunocompromised, infected with hypervirulent strains and who

had co-morbidities, which also contribute as factors implying severe CD infection and/or increased risk

of severe CD infection.

The applicant provided an analysis of the efficacy of bezlotoxumab by risk groups: analysis for patients

with or without pre-defined risk factors, indicating that all patients could possibly be at risk for CDI

recurrence and that bezlotoxumab reduces the recurrence rates in all groups. However, for patients

with no predefined risk factors, the risk difference for CDI recurrence between bezlotoxumab and

placebo groups was marginal (difference of -1.7% vs. placebo and the 95% CI included zero [-9.2,

5.7] indicating no difference between the two treatment groups). The fact that the total number stated

by the applicant as having no predefined risk factors is limited (193 patients in the bezlotoxumab

group vs. 191 patients in the placebo group) compared to the number of patients having at least 1

pre-defined risk factor (588 in the bezlotoxumab group vs. 582 in the placebo group), makes the

analysis concerning patients with “no risk factors” uncertain. The Applicant further argues that

although the risk difference for CDI between bezlotoxumab and placebo among patients with no pre
defined risk factors is small, these patients might further benefit from bezlotoxumab treatment by

having less severe recurrent CDI episodes. To support this claim a post-hoc analysis on severity was

performed (data not shown in this report). However, this analysis is based on very few patients (29

patients in the bezlotoxumab group vs. 32 in the placebo group). Therefore, firm conclusions are not

possible to draw based on these limited data. Furthermore, it is only the rate of CDI recurrence that is

studied by the primary endpoint and prevention of CDI recurrence that is applied for as an indication.

Statements indicating that bezlotoxumab might affect the symptoms of the infection and/or lighten the

clinical course of a new episode of CDI, remain speculative.

In general, the statistical analysis methods are considered acceptable. Although there is a concern

regarding the chosen primary endpoint (CDI recurrence), additional analyses are re-assuring

(concordant with the result of the primary analysis), and thus support the claimed efficacy of

bezlotoxumab.

In both studies, a number of subjects (45 % in Study P001 and 37.1 % in Study P002) had at least

one or more major protocol deviation. These protocol violations were related to clinical supplies,

efficacy assessment, entry criteria, informed consent, prohibited medications and safety assessment.

The Applicant provided a detailed assessment of major protocol deviations and the impact on the

efficacy. Also GCP findings for a specified site (Study 001, site 0058) and subsequent action were

explained, i.e. all subjects from this site were removed from the FAS population and thus not contained

within the calculation of the efficacy endpoints.

***Efficacy data and additional analyses***

The treatment groups were generally well matched with respect to gender, age, ethnicity, race,

weight, BMI and disease characteristics. The majority of the enrolled subjects were female, white and

recruited from outside the US (whereof 40 % from Europe) and were older than 65 years (however,

around 70% was < 75 years) as is expected for subjects with CDI. Regarding the demographic

characteristics the target population is well represented.

There was an approximately similar distribution between patients receiving oral metronidazole (around

45-46% in the two treatment groups) and oral vancomycin (ca. 41% in each arm) in both studies. Few

patients received fidaxomicin (< 4% in each treatment group). Across the studies and the treatment

groups there were few patients who needed to switch antibiotic therapy during the study (< 8 %).

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 83/110


-----

Median and mean duration for SoC therapy were 14 days, which is in line with the protocol. There was

a slight trend that patients receiving vancomycin had longer duration of therapy compared to those

receiving metronidazole. Days on SoC therapy prior to study drug infusion was median 3 days.

A limited number of patients having a severe type of CDI or harbouring prognostic risk factors of

developing severe CDI were included in the FAS population. This was valid for both treatment groups

in both studies. The majority of the patients did not have a past history of CDI in the past 6 months

(ca. 70%); did not have a prior history of CDI ever: the number of past CDI episodes was 0 in around

65% of the enrolled patients. A percentage of 19.2% in the bezlotoxumab group vs. 17.1% in the

placebo group had 1 CDI episode in the past. Around 80% of the patients had Zar score < 2, indicating

a less severe CDI. The analyses of different hypervirulent strains, epidemic strains and the 027

ribotype were hampered by large number of unknowns (ca. 38% in both arms for the different

categories). Of the known samples, most patients did not have these strains (most evident for the 027

ribotype and hypervirulent strains with approximately 50% of participants in both arms not harbouring

these strains). Around 80% of the included patients in both study arms did not have compromised

immunity. There were also very few patients with elevated temperature, impaired renal and/or hepatic

function and other serious conditions like pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, bowel

perforation, ileus, or who required a colectomy or other surgery due to complications of CDI.

Approximately 25-30% of the patients in the two treatment groups had elevated WBC count at

baseline. Around 65% of the patients in both arms were categorised with hospitalisation status

inpatient. Around half of the patients in the two groups had prior use of systemic antibiotics (> 50%)

and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (ca. 50%); for concomitant systemic antibiotic use, the proportion

was nearly 40 % and for PPIs around 50%.

Overall, these factors indicate that the enrolled patients might constitute a population with mild to

moderate CDI.

**CDI recurrence**

The primary endpoint for both studies is the proportion of subjects with CDI recurrence through the

Week 12. In Study P001 a lower proportion of subjects had CDI recurrence in the MK-6072 group

(17.4%) as compared to the placebo group (27.6%). The estimated difference between the MK-6072

group and the placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard

of care therapy, was -10.1% (95% CI: -15.9% to -4.3%, one-sided p = 0.0003). In Study P002 a

lower proportion of subjects had CDI recurrence in the MK-6072 group (15.7%) as compared to the

placebo group (25.7%). The estimated difference between the MK-6072 group and the placebo group,

adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, was -9.9%

(95% CI: -15.5% to -4.3%, one-sided p = 0.0003).

Taken into consideration that it is doubtful whether the included patient population can be claimed to

be the main target population, the clinical relevance of the observed difference between bezlotoxumab

and placebo is debatable. In addition, subgroup analyses indicate that patients with less severe CDI or

with few/no risk factors of developing severe CDI show low or no effect of bezlotoxumab compared to

placebo. Although results from subgroup and post-hoc analyses should be interpreted with caution, it

seems that the efficacy outcome is to some degree dependent on the severity of the manifested CD

infection or the number of risk factors the patient harbours for developing a severe CDI. Thus, the

appropriate target population needs to be further elucidated (see further: “Additional Expert

Consultation”).

EMA/853812/2016 Page 84/110


-----

It is also noted that the results are not in favour of bezlotoxumab for the subgroup age < 65 years and

men. It is known from several published articles that age ≥ 65 years and also female gender are

prognostic factors in regards to both higher incidences of CDI and higher risk of CDI recurrence and

this could therefore have had an impact on the results. Notably the known gender and age differences

were reflected in the results presented for the placebo groups, but were less pronounced in the new

drug investigational groups. These results should however be interpreted with caution.

**Global cure**

Given the limitation of the primary endpoint, the secondary endpoint “global cure” is deemed more

relevant. In Study P001 numerically higher proportion of subjects achieved global cure in the MK-6072

(60.1%) treatment group as compared to the placebo group (55.2%). However, differences between

the MK-6072 group versus the placebo group did not reach statistical significance (one sided p =

0.0861).

An improved outcome was obtained in Study P002 for the secondary endpoint of global cure for the

comparison between the MK-6072 group (66.8%) and the placebo group (52.1%, one-sided p

<0.0001). However, due to the pre-defined testing strategy, this p-value has to be interpreted as a

signal only.

**Clinical cure**

Clinical cure was an exploratory endpoint; however as a pre-requisite for proper assessment of CDI

recurrence as well from a patient’s perspective the impact on the baseline episode i.e. clinical cure is

considered as an important efficacy parameter.

In Study P001, a lower proportion of subjects achieved clinical cure of the baseline episode in the MK
6072 group (77.5 %) and in the MK-3415A group (74.7%) as compared to placebo treated patients

(82.2%). The estimated difference between the MK-6072 treatment group and the placebo group,

adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and standard of care therapy, was -5.3%

(95% CI: -10.9% to 0.3%, one sided p= 0.9679). The estimated difference between the MK-3415A

treatment group and the placebo group, adjusted for stratification factors of hospitalization status and

standard of care therapy, was -8.2% (95% CI: -13.9% to -2.4%).

In Study P002 the clinical cure rate for MK-6072 treatment (82.5%) was higher than for placebo (77.8

%) without reaching statistical significance.

The study design did not allow a proper assessment of clinical cure. In both studies a considerable

number of subjects (i.e. 25.4 % in Study P001 and 30% in Study P002) were already for more than 5

days on SOC prior to study treatment. In previous studies, resolution of diarrhoea by day 6 of

treatment and clearance of *Clostridium difficile* toxin at day 6 and 10 was the study endpoint (Zar *et*

*al.,* Clin Infect Disease 2007:45(3):302-7). It might be well possible that bezlotoxumab therapy was

initiated after resolution of the baseline episode in some patients while others were still suffering from

the baseline episode.

Although no indication is claimed for “clinical cure”, nevertheless an effect on the baseline episode is

deemed as clinical relevant. Interestingly, presence of endogenous antibodies (eAbs) at baseline,

indicate some influence on clinical cure and global cure (Tables 43 & 44). Nevertheless, there seems

no obvious biological mechanisms for eAb-B to negatively impact clinical cure and the data have to be

interpreted with caution due to methodological constraints (e.g. type of analysis, scope of analysis).

***Additional expert consultation***

A Scientific Advisory Meeting was organised to address the following concerns:

  - Identification of the appropriate target population

  - The efficacy results for the primary endpoint, herein, the clinical relevance of the observed

difference of 10% between bezlotoxumab and placebo and how these results should be

interpreted.

  - Place in the therapy given the fact that bezlotoxumab will be administered during a CDI

episode without having an influence on the actual episode (the patient even might not survive)

and preventing only further episodes up to about 12 weeks afterwards.

  - Higher failure rate (clinical cure) in the bezlotoxumab group in subjects with higher baseline

endogenous antibody B level

  - **Identification of the appropriate target population**

The applicant argued that based on the totality of the data, patients at **high risk** for CDI recurrence

are the appropriate target population for bezlotoxumab.

The experts concurred with the applicant that indeed the target population to receive bezlotoxumab in

order to prevent relapse in a 12 week period following treatment of CDI episode, constitutes the high

risk group as identified by the applicant. However, severity based on Zar score (Zar *et al* . Clin Infect

Dis 2007) is considered not universally applied within the EU clinical setting, and severity should not be

defined unequivocally as such.

Thus, aimed high risk groups for preventing CDI recurrence would conform with European guidance

(ESCMID) on “high risk” categories and the actual population studied in clinical trials:

- age >65 years

- history of previous CDI episode(s)

- immunocompromised population

- hypervirulent strains, also including ribotype 027

- Severe CDI

  - **The efficacy results for the primary endpoint, herein, the clinical relevance of the**

**observed difference of 10% between bezlotoxumab and placebo and how these**

**results should be interpreted.**

The applicant concluded that a single dose of 10 mg /kg Bezlotoxumab was efficacious in preventing

CDI recurrence through 12 weeks follow-up period, in patients receiving standard of care (SoC)

antibiotics

The experts considered the methodological limitations of the trials in receiving this outcome (for

primary outcome measure, “recurrence rate”, those not initially cured from CDI episode would not

relapse and be categorised as a success). A better informed picture emerged from the secondary

clinical endpoint, global cure, showing treatment arm difference with borderline statistical significance

obtained for one of the two pivotal trials. Nevertheless, experts were united in concluding that

meaningful clinical relevant results were obtained in the pivotal trials, although the extent of actual

benefit would only be established once the drug has been used more widely.

  - **Place in the therapy given the fact that bezlotoxumab will be administered during a**

**CDI episode without having an influence on the actual episode (the patient even**

**might not survive) and preventing only further episodes up to about 12 weeks**

**afterwards.**

The applicant considered that physicians will prescribe bezlotoxumab for patients expected to survive

the presenting CDI episode. It was also considered that the risk for recurrence is highest in the period

immediately after SoC is completed.

The experts agreed that the administration in great deal will be subject to the physician’s professional

judgement /discretion. It would be futile to administer bezlotoxumab to a patient hardly expected to

survive the initial CDI episode.

No data are however available on future re-administration (2 [nd], 3 [rd], 4 [th] course) in subsequent CDI

recurrences (after substantial time lapse) and hence it might be helpful to spell out this limitation in

the Product Information.

  - **Higher failure rate (clinical cure) in the bezlotoxumab group in subjects with higher**

**baseline endogenous antibody B level.**

The experts considered this issue as an area of uncertainty which mechanistically could not be well

explained and the data not so robust. In principle, further exploration of the relevance of circulating

endogenic Ab against toxin B (IgG type) on clinical cure would be of interest also in light of future

possible introduction of vaccines against *C. difficile* . It is however doubtful if conducting any dedicated

study at this stage would be feasible or appropriate.

Overall, the group remained divided in its recommendation.  Some experts did not support drawing

attention of the prescriber to this issue, whilst others supported the idea that the scientific observation

would benefit of further exploration (as it may be an early clinical signal of which prescribers should be

aware) and thus also to be flagged in the Product Information.

#### **2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy **

A single dose of 10 mg /kg Bezlotoxumab was efficacious in preventing CDI recurrence through 12

weeks follow-up period, in patients receiving standard of care (SoC) antibiotics. Notwithstanding stated

methodological limitations (e.g. enrolled population mainly suffered mild to moderate CDI; responder

imputation approach), meaningful clinical relevant results were obtained in the pivotal trials. Based on

the totality of the data, and outcome of the additional expert consultation, it is concluded that patients

at high risk for CDI recurrence (as identified in the trials, but excluding scoring systems) constitute the

appropriate target population to receive bezlotoxumab. ***2.6. Clinical safety ***

***Patient exposure***

**Table 41: Summary of subject exposure with bezlotoxumab, actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, or**

**placebo**

The safety assessment of bezlotoxumab is based on the two phase 3 studies, Study P001 and Study

P002.

During the Phase 1 clinical program, conducted in healthy volunteers, all but 30 subjects were exposed

either actoxumab (MK-3415) alone or actoxumab + bezlotuxomab (MK-3415A). The 30 subjects

enrolled in the Phase 1 Studies received 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg bezlotoxumab (N=6/cohort).

The same is true for the Phase 2 studies; subjects were either receiving actoxumab (MK-3415) alone

or actoxumab + bezlotuxomab (MK-3415A). In general, these data are not contributing to the safety

profile of bezlotuxomab (MK-6072).

In two Phase 3 studies, 786 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI received a 10 mg/kg dose of

bezlotoxumab and 781 received placebo (0.9% NaCl). Additionally, 30 healthy subjects were exposed

to bezlotoxumab in a Phase 1 study.

***Adverse events***

In the Phase 3 trials (Study P001, and Study P002), non-serious AEs were collected from the time of

study medication infusion until Week 4 post-infusion

-----

An integrated Phase 3 dataset (Study P001 + Study P002) was provided. The majority of subjects

reported one or more AEs (60.5% across all treatment groups) with similar percentages reported in

the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab (58.6%), bezlotoxumab (61.7%), and placebo (61.2%) treatment

groups. Overall, 6.6% of subjects reported at least 1 drug-related AE during the first 4 weeks of the

follow-up period with similar percentages reported in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab (6.4%),

bezlotoxumab (7.5%), and placebo (5.9%) treatment groups. Across all treatment groups, drug
related AEs were reported most frequently for the SOCs of General Disorders and Administration Site

Conditions (1.8%), Gastrointestinal Disorders (1.6%) and Nervous System Disorders (1.6%). The most

frequently reported drug-related AEs across all treatment groups were nausea (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%),

headache (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%).

An individual analysis of the two pivotal studies further supports the evidence that the differences the

incidence of AEs between the treatment groups were due to chance. In Study P001, the proportions of

subjects who experienced at least one AE during the 4- week period following infusion in each

treatment group were 59.7%, 67.2%, 65.4%, and 62.0% in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab,

actoxumab, bezlotoxumab, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. In Study P002, the proportions

of subjects who experienced at least one AE during the 4- week period following infusion in each

treatment group were 57.4%, 58.1%, and 60.4% in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab, bezlotoxumab,

and placebo treatment groups, respectively.

In the phase 1 Study, the most common AEs in the patients receiving bezlotoxumab were headache

[11 (36.7%)], fatigue [7 (23.3%)], nausea [2 (6.7%)], vomiting [2 (6.7%)], pain [2 (6.7%)], and

seasonal allergy [2 (6.7%)].

In the integrated Phase 1 database, all AEs in the bezlotoxumab or actoxumab + bezlotoxumab

treatment groups were non-serious and mild to moderate in intensity, and the majority (89.9%) were

assessed by study investigators to be unrelated to infusion.

EMA/853812/2016 Page 90/110

***Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events***

Serious AEs (SAEs), including all deaths, were collected from the time of study medication infusion

until the Week 12 post-infusion visit.

In the integrated data across the 2 Phase 3 trials, a total of 29.8% of subjects experienced a SAE

during the 12-week follow-up period. The proportion of subjects with a SAE was lower in the active

treatment groups compared to placebo (bezlotoxumab: 29.4%; actoxumab + bezlotoxumab: 27.3%;

placebo: 32.7%). The most frequently reported SAEs across all treatment groups were CDI (4.7%),

pneumonia (2.0%), sepsis (1.8%), diarrhea (1.6%), and urinary tract infection (1.5%). A numerically

higher percentage of subjects reported SAEs of CDI, pneumonia, and sepsis in the placebo group as

compared to the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab and bezlotoxumab groups.

In the integrated data across the 2 Phase 3 trials, there were a total of 12 (0.5%) subjects reporting

one or more serious and drug-related AEs through Week 12 and at least one serious and drug-related

AE was reported in each treatment group: 6 (0.8%) in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab group, 4

(0.5%) in the bezlotoxumab group, and 2 (0.3%) in the placebo group. One in the bezlotoxumab

group reported diarrhoea at Day 34. Only sepsis was reported by more than one subject: one subject

each in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab and bezlotoxumab groups.

During the 12 week post-infusion period, 166 (7.1%) subjects in the integrated Phase 3 dataset across

the 3 treatment groups reported one or more AEs with a fatal outcome: 51 (6.6%) in the actoxumab +

bezlotoxumab group, 56 (7.1%) in the bezlotoxumab group, and 59 (7.6%) in the placebo group.

Approximately half of these subjects (92, 3.9%) died during the first 4 weeks post-infusion 28 (3.6%)

in the actoxumab +bezlotoxumab group, 32 (4.1%) in the bezlotoxumab group, and 32 (4.1%) in the

placebo group. The most frequently reported AEs with a fatal outcome were septic shock (15, 0.6%),

sepsis (14, 0.6%), pneumonia (11, 0.5%), cardiac failure (10, 0.4%), and respiratory failure (9,

0.4%). A higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group died of sepsis or septic shock compared to

the other 2 treatment groups: 17 (2.2%) in the placebo group compared to 5 (0.7%) in the actoxumab

+ bezlotoxumab group and 7 (0.9%) in the bezlotoxumab group.

There were 3 subjects who had AEs with a fatal outcome considered by the investigator to be related

to study medication. All 3 subjects were hospitalised for serious medical conditions at the time of CDI

diagnosis and study entry. All of these events had an onset of < 19 days from day of infusion with

study medication. Two of the 3 subjects were in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab group: One subject

(Study P001) with AEs of sepsis, hypoglycemia, and respiratory arrest and one subject (Study P002)

with the AE of small intestinal obstruction. In the bezlotoxumab group, one subject reported AEs of

sepsis and cerebral haemorrhage. All 3 of these events were associated with bacteraemia, sepsis, or

septic shock. The events are consistent with comorbidity.

**Study P001**

There was one planned interim efficacy analysis to be performed when approximately 640 enrolled

subjects (40% of planned total). After a detailed review of the unblinded safety and efficacy data from

all four treatment arms and a careful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, the DMC recommended that

enrolment in the MK-3415 arm (i.e., treatment group containing the monoclonal antibody against

Toxin A only) be stopped since an increase in SAEs and death were observed in this treatment arm.

**Long-term extension Study P002**

A subgroup of 295 subjects (112 in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab group, 100 in the bezlotoxumab

group, and 83 in the placebo group) were followed up to 12 months after receiving study medication

infusion (referred to as the extension cohort). The demographic characteristics and prognostic risk

factors of subjects who participated in the extension phase of the trial were similar across the three

treatment groups.

A total of 9 subjects (3.1%) died during the 9-month extension phase. The 9 subjects who died had a

total of 15 adverse events with a fatal outcome. None of these AEs were deemed to be treatment
related by the investigator.

Additionally, during the extension phase, one subject (0.3%) in the bezlotoxumab group had an SAE

(osteoporotic fracture of the femur) that was considered by the investigator to be drug-related.

**Study P020 (Phase 1)**

In the integrated Phase 1 database, there were no SAEs, deaths, or discontinuations in any of the

treatment groups.

***Laboratory findings***

In the 2 Phase 3 trials (P001, P002), blood and urine samples for haematology, chemistry, and

urinalysis testing were taken on Day 1 prior to study infusion and on post-infusion Day 4 (±1 day),

Day 11 (±2 days), and Day 29 (±3 days). A panel of laboratory measurements was also taken at the

time of a new episode of diarrhoea. Laboratory results determined by the study investigator to be

clinically relevant were recorded as AEs.

The mean change from baseline at the Day 4, Day 11, and Week 4 visits for each of the chemistry and

haematology values listed in the individual protocols (Study P001 and Study P002) indicates that the

mean changes from baseline were consistent across treatment groups.

Vital signs

In the Phase 3 program (Study P001 and Study P002), vital sign measurements were taken prior to

study infusion, at 30 minutes after the start of the study infusion, and at the end of the study infusion

on Day 1. Additionally, vital sign measurements were taken at post infusion study visits Day 4 (±1

day), Day 11 (±2days), Day 29 (±3 days), Day 57 (±7 days), and Day 85 (±5 days).

There were no clinically meaningful changes in diastolic or systolic blood pressure, heart rate, or

respiratory rate between subjects who received active treatment and those who received placebo.

***Safety in special populations***

A substantial number of elderly subjects (65 years of age and older) were enrolled in the Phase 3

trials.

In general, the proportion of subjects reporting one or more AEs was slightly higher in the older age

group across all treatment groups compared to the younger age group. The overall proportion of SAEs

and deaths was also higher in the older age group. The proportions of subjects reporting at least one

AE, at least one drug-related AE, or deaths were generally comparable across treatment groups within

each age subcategory. Similar to the overall population, the proportion of subjects reporting SAEs was

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 92/110


-----

lower in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab treatment group compared to the placebo group in both

younger and older age subcategories.

Interestingly, for the SOC cardiac disorder, there was a clear trend to increasing frequencies with older

age, but however, very similar to the observations in the placebo group. An FDA meeting of the

Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMIDAC) discussed the biologic license application for

bezlotoxumab injection from MSD and a safety analysis by baseline Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

was performed by FDA. Analysis showed a numerical difference in the occurrence of AEs, SAEs, and

death among the bezlotoxumab-treated subjects with baseline CHF as compared to placebo-treated

patients. The applicant further satisfactorily discussed these imbalances in responses to CHMP.

The safety of bezlotoxumab was not assessed in adolescents or children less than 18 years of age or in

pregnant or lactating women.

***Immunological events***

Subjects were evaluated during the infusion and for 24 hours post infusion for infusion specific

reactions.

Overall, in both Phase 3 trials, 8.6% of subjects reported one or more infusion specific reactions. The

proportion of subjects in the bezlotoxumab group (10.3%) who reported one or more infusion specific

AEs was similar to placebo (7.6%) (difference = 2.8%, 95% CI [-0.1, 5.6]).

Infusion-related AEs reported in ≥ 0.5% of subjects receiving bezlotoxumab and at a frequency greater

than placebo were nausea (2.8%), fatigue (1.1%), pyrexia (1.0%), dizziness (1.3%), headache

(1.9%), dyspnoea (0.8%) and hypertension (0.6%).

The proportions of individual infusion specific AEs were similar for the bezlotoxumab and placebo

groups, with the exception of hypertension: 5 (0.6%) subjects in the bezlotoxumab versus 0 subjects

in the placebo groups reported hypertension (estimated difference = 0.6% [95% CI: 0.1, 1.5]).

Hypertension occurred more frequently in the bezlotoxumab group (n=5, 0.6%) compared to placebo

(n=0, difference 0.6%, 95% CI [0.1, 1.5]). Hypertension was generally mild to moderate and did not

lead to treatment interruption in any subject. All episodes of hypertension resolved within 2 days

(range of duration of event 36 minutes to 2 days). None of these subjects required a new or revised

dosage of an antihypertensive medication, and no complications from the hypertension were noted.

***Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions***

As bezlotoxumab is eliminated by protein catabolism and is not metabolized, nor is it renally

eliminated, an effect on safety due to drug-drug interactions would not be expected for bezlotoxumab

or on concomitantly administered medications based on the low potential of bezlotoxumab to be a

perpetrator or victim of such interactions.

***Discontinuation due to adverse events***

Across the two Phase 3 trials, only 1 subject reported AEs resulting in study medication

discontinuation. This subject, randomised to the bezlotoxumab group, experienced ventricular

tachyarrhythmia, chills, and dizziness with an onset approximately 36 minutes after the start of the

infusion with bezlotoxumab. The subject was given fenistil, prednisolone, and ranitidine intravenously.

The chills and ventricular tachyarrhythmia resolved within 2 to 5 minutes, and the dizziness resolved

within 90 minutes. The subject went on to complete the study through the 12-week follow-up period.

Assessment report
EMA/853812/2016 Page 93/110


-----

These events were considered to be related to study medication by the investigator; the ventricular

tachyarrhythmia event was reported as an SAE.

***Adverse events of special interest***

**Study P001 and Study P002**

Overdose and hepatic safety were defined in the individual Phase 3 trials as events of special interest.

**Overdose**

Doses higher than the intended dose of 10 mg/kg met the original protocol definition of an overdose.

During the conduct of the study the dose level for an overdose was revised in an amendment to the

protocol to be >20 mg/kg because doses as high as 20 mg/kg had been shown to be well tolerated in

healthy volunteers.

A total of 17 subjects randomized to an active treatment group received more than the intended dose,

i.e. - 10.5 mg/kg. Of those, 12 experienced an AE: 5 subjects in the actoxumab + bezlotoxumab

group and 7 subjects in the bezlotoxumab group. Dose overages ranged from 0.5 to 4.8 mg/kg with

the exception of 2 subjects who received 20 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab.

No subjects received a dose >20 mg/kg.

**Hepatic Safety**

The subjects’ laboratory values were monitored during the Phase 3 trials for hepatic safety. To meet

the hepatic event of clinical interest (ECI) criteria, all of the following conditions were required: 1) an

elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that was greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal;

2) an elevated total bilirubin (BILI) laboratory value that was greater than or equal to 2X the upper

limit of normal; 3) an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) laboratory value that was less than 2X the upper

limit of normal; and 4) a clinically significant increase in values if baseline values were elevated. Eight

subjects were identified in the Phase 3 clinical trials with liver function laboratory values meeting one

or more of the potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) criteria at some point during the trial,

including at the time of enrolment in the trial (bezlotoxumab: 1, actoxumab + bezlotoxumab: 4,

placebo: 3). Based upon medical review of each of the 8 cases, none of these events was considered to

be suggestive of DILI. The laboratory results for these subjects were confounded by pre-existing

medical conditions, including HCV infection with recent radiotherapy to the liver, colitis, left kidney

mass, and sickle cell anaemia; hence, these pre-existing medical conditions may have contributed to

the abnormal laboratory values.
#### **2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety **

The Applicant presented an integrated safety data analysis for the Phase 3 trials. Since these trials

were nearly identical trials, this approach is acceptable. Of note, the data from the actoxumab (MK34
15) arm (in Study P001) are excluded from the integrated analyses. This arm was dropped after the

interim analysis due to safety concerns. The safety data base for bezlotoxomab includes 786 patients

included in the phase 3 trials and 30 healthy subjects included in a phase 1 trial. In addition 777

subjects were treated with the combination therapy actoxumab + bezolotuxumab in the phase 3

studies. This enlarges, to some extent, the data base for subjects exposed to bezolotoxumab.

In the pivotal studies P001 and P002, adverse events experienced by subjects during the first 4 weeks

following infusion with study treatment were collected. The majority of subjects (60.5% across all

treatment groups) reported one or more AE. However, similar percentages were reported in the 4

-----

treatment groups. An individual analysis of the two pivotal studies further supports the evidence that

the differences in the incidence of AEs between the treatment groups were obtained by chance. In

general, the incidence of AEs was similar across the treatment groups.

Serious AEs (SAEs), including all deaths, were collected from the time of study medication infusion

until the Week 12 post-infusion visit. The proportion of subjects with a SAE was lower in the active

treatment groups compared to placebo. The proportion of AEs with fatal outcome was comparable in

all treatment groups and consistent with age and comorbidity. A higher proportion of subjects in the

placebo group died of sepsis or septic shock compared to the bezlotoxumab treatment groups.  In

Study P001, the actuxumab arm was discontinued after the planned interim analysis due to safety

reasons i.e. increase in SAEs and death. In addition, in the phase 2 study P017 (actuxumab+

bezlotoxumab vs. Placebo), there were 2 drug-related SAEs leading to death, both in the combination

arm.

The proportion of subjects reporting one or more AEs was slightly higher in the older age group (65

years of age and older) across all treatment groups compared to the younger age group. The overall

proportion of SAEs and deaths was also higher in the older age group. Interestingly, for the SOC

cardiac disorder, there was a clear trend to increasing frequencies with older age, but however, very

similar to the observations in the placebo group. There are some apparent imbalances in AEs/SAEs in

patients with CHF at baseline between the bezlotoxumab and placebo arms. However, the numbers are

small and hence it is not possible to draw conclusions on any increased risks of AE/SAEs in CHF

patients treated with bezlotoxumab.

No specific safety signals with regard to clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs and physical findings

are detected with the intravenous single-dose treatment with bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg. Across

treatment groups, no remarkable findings with regard to age, gender, race, weight, renal impairment,

and hepatic impairment were observed. In particular, no events occurred which would be suggestive

of drug-induced liver injury.

In both Phase 3 studies, subjects were evaluated for infusion-specific reactions during the infusion and

for 24 hours post infusion. The proportion of subjects in the bezlotoxumab group who reported one or

more infusion specific AEs was similar to placebo.

Based on the reassuring ECG data obtained from the phase 3 trials, with no signals of QT prolongation

above placebo level, no thorough QT study is deemed necessary.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Summary of Product Characteristics.
#### **2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety **

In the clinical study program, a single IV administration of 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxmab in subjects 18

years or older was well tolerated. There were some noted imbalances in AEs/SAEs in patients with CHF

at baseline between the bezlotoxumab and placebo arms. However the totality of the safety data at

present suggests that there is no clear evidence that bezlotoxumab is associated with a negative effect

on cardiac function.

Overall, robust conclusion on safety is however hampered by the small sample patient population; and

the underlying morbidity and co-morbidity of the patients.

|Col1|Package Leaflet: Section 1 What ZINPLAVA is and what is it used for? ZINPLAVA is a medicine that is given together with an antibiotic to prevent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) from coming back in patients 18 years of age or older who have a high risk of CDI coming back. How ZINPLAVA works • When people get CDI, they are usually given an antibiotic to get rid of the infection but CDI can often come back within weeks or months. • The bacteria responsible for CDI produce a toxin that can inflame and damage your colon, causing stomach pain and severe diarrhoea. ZINPLAVA acts by attaching to the toxin and blocking it, thereby preventing the symptoms of CDI from coming back. Section 2 What you need to know before you are give ZINPLAVA under Warnings and precautions ZINPLAVA is not a treatment for CDI. ZINPLAVA has no effect on the CDI you have now.

## **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **
#### ***3.1. Therapeutic Context *** **3.1.1. Disease or condition **

*Clostridium difficile* is a spore forming, gram-positive bacillus that causes infection (CDI) in humans. It

produces toxins that lead to epithelial damage and inflammation in the gut. Symptoms of CDI can

range from mild diarrhea to profuse watery diarrhea, leading to dehydration, life threatening

complications, and sometimes death. In vulnerable populations, the incidence of CDI-related morbidity

and mortality increases significantly. While antibiotic therapy is generally effective at resolving the

symptoms, recurrences are common due to persistent or newly-acquired *C. difficile* spores, whose

outgrowth and toxin expression are facilitated by the gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotics.

One of the greatest challenges in managing CDI is preventing its recurrence, a critical unmet medical

need.  After initial treatment and resolution of diarrhea, 15% to 35% of CDI patients experience

recurrence. Of those who have a primary recurrence, 40% will have another CDI episode and after 2

recurrences, the likelihood of an additional episode increases further to as high as 65%.  The majority

of these recurrences occur within 60 days of the initial treatment, but additional cases can be seen

beyond 60 days (Bouza E., 2012; McFarland LV., 2009). Recurrent CDI is more difficult to treat and is

associated with more hospitalizations, severe outcomes, and higher costs than initial episodes of CDI. **3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need **

Current strategies for treating CDI include using CDI-active antibiotics, halting the use of antibiotics

that disrupt the gut microbial flora and promote the conditions that allow *C. difficile* outgrowth (if

possible), and providing supportive care, as needed. Oral metronidazole, oral vancomycin and oral

fidaxomicin are recommended in treatment guidelines, but only vancomycin and fidaxomicin have a

regulatory-approved indication for the treatment of CDI. Treatment strategies are based on treatment

guidelines from medical associations (Cohen SH *et al.*, 2010, Debast SB *et al* ., 2014, Surawicz CM *et*

*al* ., 2013). For mild cases of CDI, oral metronidazole is recommended in treatment guidelines as the

standard of care. For more severe cases of CDI, oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin are

recommended. IV metronidazole in combination with vancomycin may also be used in severe cases.

As noted above, 15% to 35% of patients will experience recurrence of CDI after therapy of the first

episode with metronidazole or vancomycin, the most commonly used antibiotics for CDI. Based on

treatment guidelines, the approaches to the treatment of recurrent CDI include repeat courses of

vancomycin or metronidazole, vancomycin in tapered and pulsed doses, vancomycin followed by

rifaximin, fidaxomicin, IV immunoglobulin, and therapy with other microorganisms including fecal

microbiota for transplantation (FMT) (Kelly CP *et al* ., 2008). Treatment of a first recurrent CDI episode

with a repeat course of metronidazole or vancomycin is successful in only ~50% of patients (Leffler

DA, Lamont JT., 2015). Treatment of multiple recurrences is particularly difficult, mainly due to

persistence of spores in the gut and the inability of the patient to mount an effective immune response

to *C. difficile* toxins (Maroo S, LaMont JT., 2006). FMT, although used in increasing numbers, remains

an investigational treatment option. Currently, there are no treatments that are licensed for

prevention of CDI recurrence, thereby making availability of safe and efficacious therapies for

prevention of CDI recurrence an unmet medical need.
#### **3.2 Main clinical studies ** ***3.2.1 Favourable effects ***

The Applicant submitted a MA for bezlotoxumab, intended for the prevention of a recurrence of

*Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) in patients 18 years or older receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI.

The CDI recurrence was defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhea associated with a

positive local or central stool test for toxigenic *C. difficile* following clinical cure of the baseline CDI

episode. The endpoint recurrence of CDI was investigated in both pivotal trials in comparison to

placebo treatment. The number of patients completing the studies and included in the full analysis set

(FAS) was 781 in the bezlotoxumab group versus 773 in the placebo group. In each of these trials, a

lower proportion of subjects had CDI recurrence in the bezlotoxumab group as compared to the

placebo group in both pivotal trials (adjusted difference P001: -10.2%, 95%CI -15.9; -4.3%; P002: 
9.9%, 95% CI -15.5; -4.3). In pooled analysis (MODIFY I and MODIFY II integrated analysis) CDI

Recurrence Rate through 12 Weeks after infusion, showed an observed difference in prevention of CDI

recurrence between bezlotoxumab and placebo of about 10% (p<0.0001).

The secondary endpoint, global cure, was defined as clinical cure of the baseline CDI episode and no

CDI recurrence through Week 12. A higher proportion of subjects had global cure in the bezlotoxumab

group as compared to the placebo group in both pivotal trials (adjusted difference P001: 4.8%, 95%CI

-2.1; 11.7%; P002: 14.7%, 95% CI 7.7; 21.4). Only the results from P002 were statistically significant

with regard to this secondary endpoint.

Excluding patients that did not achieve clinical cure of the initial episode was a secondary analysis of

the recurrence endpoint and shows a lower rate of CDI recurrence in bezlotoxumab treated patients in

trial P001 (adjusted difference -10.8%, 95%CI -17.7;-3.8, one-sided p= 0.0013) and trial P002

(adjusted difference  -13.7, 95%CI -20.4;-6.9, one-sided p <0.0001).

A prospectively planned combined analysis of the CDI recurrence rates in pre-specified subgroups of

patients across the two Phase 3 trials (FAS), showed that overall, 51 % were ≥ 65 years of age, 29%

were ≥ 75 years and 39 % received one or more systemic antibacterial agents during the 12 week

follow-up period. Of the total, 28 % had one or more episodes of CDI within the six months prior to the

episode under treatment (18 % of the patients had one, 7 % had two and a few patients had 3 or

more prior episodes). Twenty (20) percent of the patients were immunocompromised and 16 %

presented with clinically severe CDI. Among the 976/1554 (62%) patients who had a positive baseline

stool culture for *C. difficile* a hypervirulent strain (ribotypes 027, 078 or 244) was isolated in 22 %

(217 of 976 patients), of which the majority (87 %, 189 of 217 strains) were ribotype 027. These

patients presented risk factors primarily but not exclusively associated with higher risk of CDI

recurrence. The results were in favour of bezlotoxumab in patients belonging to the following

subgroups characterising a severe CDI and/or representing a prognostic risk factor of having CDI

recurrence: with history of CDI in the 6 months prior to enrolment, with clinically severe CDI at study

entry, ≥ 65 years, and with compromised immunity.

#### ***3.2.2 Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects ***

No formal clinical dose-finding study has been performed; the selected dose of 10 mg/kg is mainly

based on non-clinical studies, PK-studies and the results achieved in the Phase 2 studies.

CDI recurrence was defined as the development of a new episode of diarrhoea following resolution of

the initial episode (“clinical cure”). However, subjects not having clinical cure of the initial episode were

considered as not having CDI recurrence and were therefore evaluated as treatment success and not

as “non-responders”. Even if pre-specified in the analysis plan, this approach is questionable. A more

appropriate approach would have been randomisation after achieving clinical cure after the initial

episode. If the objective of the treatment is the prevention of recurrence, initial clinical cure must be

achieved. This approach is reflected in the secondary endpoint “global cure” which combines initial

clinical cure and freedom from recurrence through week 12. Results were statistically significant in only

one of the two trials.

The majority of the patients in the two pivotal studies did not have severe CDI and/or prognostic risk

factors for developing severe CDI or increasing the possibility for recurrence of CDI. Low numbers of

patients with a history of CDI in the past 6 months or ever, compromised immunity, elevated

temperature and/or WBC count, impaired renal and/or hepatic function or other serious conditions like

pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, ileus, or requiring a colectomy or other

surgery due to complications of CDI were included. The majority of the patients having a history of CDI

had only experienced one prior episode. Most patients were > 65 years old; however, the proportion of

patients > 75 years was limited. Around 80% of the patients had Zar score < 2, indicating a less

severe CDI. Most patients were not diagnosed with a CDI caused by a hypervirulent strain (including

ribotype 027); however, the ribotyping analyses were hampered by a large proportion of unknown

strains. Overall, these factors indicate that the enrolled patients might have suffered from mild to

moderate CDI, questioning the applicability/generalisability of study results. It is also noted that the

results are not in favour of bezlotoxumab for the larger subgroups age < 65 years and men. The

efficacy results for the primary endpoint, i.e. the overall observed difference in prevention of CDI

recurrence between bezlotoxumab and placebo, was about 10%, but lower in patients with no

identified risk factors.

Mechanistically, bezlotoxumab can only act on the toxin prior to binding to the cellular receptors. Given

that a normal immunoglobulin will access the enteric lumen to a very limited amount (if at all) some

degree of injury to the gut lining must happen in order for the product to show efficacy. It is therefore

questionable as to why the more relevant secondary endpoint, global cure (which included cure of the

initial episode), did not achieve more convincing results. Furthermore, in one of the trials, the placebo

performed numerically better as regards the clinical cure of the initial episode. It is well understood

that the Applicant did not claim the indication “clinical cure”; nevertheless an effect on the baseline

episodes is deemed clinical relevant and determines the place of bezlotoxumab in the therapeutic

armamentarium. In order to benefit from the bezlotoxumab therapy which is initiated during the

baseline episode the patient has to recover from the first episode. Furthermore the benefit is limited to

the prevention of CDI episode(s) in close timely relation to the baseline episode due to nature of the

product (i.e. half-life of 19 days).

Further on, the presence of endogenous antibodies to toxin B at baseline seems to have an influence

on clinical cure. This remains an issue of uncertainty which cannot be well explained.

#### ***3.2.3 Unfavourable effects ***

In the two Phase 3 trials, the most common adverse reactions following treatment with bezlotoxumab

(reported in ≥ 4 % of patients within the first 4 weeks of infusion) were nausea, diarrhoea, pyrexia

and headache. These adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency in placebo treated

patients compared with bezlotoxumab treated patients.

Numerical differences in the occurrence of AEs, SAEs, and death were observed among the

bezlotoxumab treated subjects with baseline CHF, as compared to placebo-treated patients. Numbers

are, however, small.

In clinical studies, serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were reported

in 29 % of Zinplava-treated patients and 33 % in patients receiving placebo.

Overall, 10 % of subjects in the bezlotoxumab group experienced one or more infusion specific adverse

reactions on the day of, or the day after, the infusion compared to 8 % in the placebo group. Infusion

specific adverse reactions reported in ≥ 0.5 % of subjects receiving bezlotoxumab and at a frequency

greater than placebo were nausea (3 %), fatigue (1 %), pyrexia (1 %), dizziness (1 %),

headache (2 %), dyspnoea (1 %) and hypertension (1 %). Of the patients who experienced an

infusion specific adverse reaction, the majority reported a reaction with a maximum intensity of mild

(78 %) or moderate (20 %), and the majority of reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset. ***3.2.4 Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects ***

Small sample size, underlying disease and co-morbidity as well as observed numerical difference in the

occurrence of AEs, SAEs, and death among the bezlotoxumab-treated subjects with baseline

congestive heart failure (CHF) as compared to placebo-treated patients, constitute the major

uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects. ***3.2.5 Effects Table ***

#### ***3.3 Benefit-risk assessment and discussion *** **3.3.1 Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects **

Symptoms of CDI can range from mild diarrhoea to profuse watery diarrhoea, leading to dehydration,

life threatening complications, and sometimes death. In general antibiotic therapy is effective at

resolving the symptoms. However, among patients treated for CDI, 15% to 35% experience a

recurrence of CDI. Of note, in vulnerable populations, the incidence of CDI-related morbidity and

mortality increases significantly. Therefore the prevention of recurrence is of clinical relevance. The

obtained results for the primary endpoint taken at face value are considered of sufficiently high

magnitude to be considered important. However, due to the chosen design and the analysis, there is

concern that the treatment effect is uncertain and possibly overestimated as can be deduced from the

secondary endpoints.

The relevance of the observed difference between bezlotoxumab and placebo was questioned, taken

into account that the representativeness of the patient population, in terms of the severity of the CDI

and the risk of experiencing recurrence, was considered doubtful. The efficacy outcome seems to be

dependent on the severity of the manifested CD infection or the number of risk factors, which include,

but are not limited to age > 65 years, previous CDI episodes, compromised immune system, infection

with 027 ribotype or other hypervirulent strains.

There appears however to be low to no effect of bezlotoxumab compared to placebo in patients with

less severe CDI or with few/no risk factors for developing severe CDI.

Bezlotoxumab given as a single IV 10 mg/kg dose in subjects 18 years or older, was generally well

tolerated. The observed safety profile is in general similar to placebo; however there are some

apparent imbalances in AEs/SAEs in patients with CHF at baseline between the bezlotoxumab and

placebo arms. The numbers are, however, small and it is therefore not possible to draw definitive

conclusions on any increased risks of AE/SAEs in CHF patients treated with bezlotoxumab. Totality of

the safety data at present, suggests that there is no clear evidence that bezlotoxumab is associated

with a negative effect on heart function.

Overall, robust conclusion on safety is hampered by the small sample patient population; and the

underlying morbidity and co-morbidity of the patients. However, the safety profile is considered

sufficiently reassuring. **3.3.2 Balance of benefits and risks **

Based on the totality of the data on efficacy and safety, and taking account of the conclusions reached

by the consulted experts, the patients a t high risk for CDI recurrence are considered as the appropriate

target population to receive bezlotoxumab, aiming to prevent CDI recurrence. This takes account of

the favourable results obtained in both Phase 3 trials, particularly pertaining to patients who presented

risk factors primarily (but not exclusively) associated with higher risk of CDI recurrence. The aimed

high risk groups for preventing CDI recurrence generally conform to the European guidance (ESCMID)

on “high risk” categories for CDI recurrence.

#### ***3.4 Conclusions ***

The overall benefit-risk of Zinplava is positive for the prevention of recurrence of *Clostridium difficile*

infection (CDI) in adults at high risk for recurrence of CDI.
## **4. Recommendations **

***Outcome***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the risk-benefit balance of Zinplava is favourable in the following indication:

ZINPLAVA is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of *Clostridium difficile* infection (CDI) in adults
at high risk for recurrence of CDI (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

conditions:

***Other conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use***

Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.

***Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation***

**Periodic Safety Update Reports**

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set

out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product

within 6 months following authorisation.

***Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product***

**Risk Management Plan (RMP)**

The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the

agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent

updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted:
### • At the request of the European Medicines Agency; • Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new

information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or

as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being

reached.

***New Active Substance Status***

Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that bezlotoxumab is considered

to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised

within the European Union.
