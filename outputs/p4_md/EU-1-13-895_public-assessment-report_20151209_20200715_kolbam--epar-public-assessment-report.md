##### ***Information on Paediatric requirements ***

Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s)

P/206/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/206/2011 was not yet completed as some

measures were deferred. ***Information relating to orphan market exclusivity ***

**Similarity**

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised
###### orphan medicinal products .

**Derogation of market exclusivity**

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

847/2000, the applicant submitted a claim addressing the following derogation laid down in Article 8.3

of the same Regulation; the applicant can establish in the application that the medicinal product,

although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorised, is safer, more effective or

otherwise clinically superior.
##### ***Applicant’s request for consideration *** **Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances **

The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional

circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 based on the following

claims: the applicant justified that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and

safety under normal conditions of use, because: the indications for which the product in question is

intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide

comprehensive evidence, and that it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical

ethics to collect such information. The applicant proposed as specific obligation to expand the data

available on the clinical safety and efficacy of cholic acid in the treatment of inborn errors of bile acid

synthesis by establishing a patient registry. **New active Substance status **

The applicant requested the active substance (cholic acid) contained in the above medicinal product to

be considered as a new active substance in itself, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of

a product previously authorised within the Union. ***Protocol Assistance ***

The applicant did not seek Protocol Assistance at the CHMP. ***Licensing status ***

The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application. At present,

several products containing combinations of cholic acid with other active substances are marketed in a

few EU countries. On 13 September 2013 Orphacol (cholic acid) was granted a marketing authorisation

in the EU for the treatment of treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis due to 3β
Hydroxy-Δ [5] -C 27 -steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ [4] -3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in

infants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults.

It should be noted that cholic acid is an endogenous substance and is used in foods as a food

additive (E 1000) in low concentrations. Historically medicinal products containing cholic acid

have been used for other indications, such as laxatives and choleretics since at least the early

part of the 20 [th] century.

### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1. Introduction ***
###### **Problem statement **

The inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are a category of metabolic liver disease (Setchell & Heubi,

2006). These conditions are extremely rare genetic disorders and cholic acid has been granted orphan

medicinal product status pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 for the treatment of inborn errors

in primary bile acid synthesis (EU/3/09/683) with a calculated prevalence of 0.07 per 10,000 people in

the European Union (EU). Individuals with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis lack the enzymes needed

to synthesize the primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acids (CDCA). This

deficiency results in diminished production of primary bile that are essential for promoting bile flow and

the concomitant production of high concentrations of atypical bile acids and bile acid intermediates

(Heubi *et al.* 2007). The enzyme deficiency allows these bile acid intermediates that are the substrates

for a particular enzyme, to accumulate and these can be metabolised to an array of unusual bile acids,

several of which have been shown to be hepatotoxic. The absence of primary bile acids causes

hepatocytes to continuously metabolize cholesterol in an attempt to established normal bile acid pool.

The result is the continued production of high concentrations of these hepatotoxic metabolites, which

cause a progressive cholestasis. The liver disease associated with these inborn errors in bile acid

synthesis is progressive and, if untreated, may lead to death from cirrhosis and liver failure (Heubi *et*

*al.* 2007).

Disorders in bile acid synthesis and metabolism can be broadly classified as primary or secondary.

Primary enzyme defects involve congenital deficiencies in enzymes responsible for catalysing key

reactions in the synthesis of cholic and CDCA. The primary enzyme defects include:

 - 3β-hydroxy-Δ [5] -C27-steroid oxidoreductase (also known as 3β-hydroxy- Δ5-C27-steroid

dehydrogenase/isomerase or 3β-HSD or *HSD3* β *7* )deficiency

 - Δ [4] -3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase (Δ [4] -3-oxo-R or *AKR1D1* ) deficiency

 - Sterol 27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis,CTX) deficiency

 - Defective bile acid amidation due to failure to conjugate with glycine and/or taurine

 - 2- (or α-) methylacyl-CoA racemase ( *AMACR* ) deficiency

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 9/97


-----

 - Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase *(CYP7B1)* deficiency

 - Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase *(CYP7A1)* deficiency

 - Trihydroxycholestanoic acid (THCA) CoA oxidase deficiency

 - Side-chain oxidation defect in the sterol 25-hydroxylation pathway

The most common enzyme deficiency appears to be 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase

deficiency, followed by Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase ( *AKR1D1* ) deficiency, sterol 27-hydroxylase

(CTX) deficiency and amidation defects (Heubi *et al.* 2007).

At the time of the submission of the application by the applicant no treatment had a marketing

authorisation in the EU. The only therapeutic option in severely affected cases was liver transplant. On

13 September 2013 Orphacol (cholic acid) was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU for the

treatment of treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis due to 3β-Hydroxy-Δ [5] -C 27 -steroid

oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ [4] -3-Oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and

adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults. Deficiencies in 3β-HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR are two of the

nine indications initially claimed by the applicant.

Oral administration of cholic acid, the substance missing in affected patients, inhibits the production of

the hepatotoxic bile acid precursors by down-regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate limiting

enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). In addition, it provides a stimulus for bile

flow facilitating the hepatic clearance of toxic bile acid precursors and toxic substances, including

bilirubin. It also improves growth by facilitating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fat (Setchell

& Heubi, 2006).
###### **About the product **

The active substance of Kolbam is cholic acid. Cholic acid is a primary bile acid and is classified

as a bile and liver therapy, bile acid preparations. Primary bile acids are biosynthesised in the

liver of healthy men and are key constituents of normal bile. The two primary bile acids

synthesised by the human liver, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, serve several important

physiological functions (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). Cholic acid represents between

approximately half and two thirds of the primary bile acids produced in adult humans. In

addition to facilitating fat absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and to participating in the

regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, the primary bile acids provide the major driving force for

the promotion and secretion of bile. They are essential to the development of the enterohepatic

circulation, which is necessary for the elimination of toxic endogenous or exogenous substances.

The applicant applied for 2 strengths: 50 and 250 mg both as hard capsules. **Type of application and aspect on development **

The application submitted is composed of a complete dossier including quality data; non-clinical data

are based on bibliographic literature substituting all non-clinical tests and clinical data are based on the

own applicant’s clinical data supported by bibliographic literature. The applicant has submitted one

pivotal clinical study involving a total of 85 patients and a second study which was actually a subset of

the pivotal study. The findings of these studies are supplemented by clinical studies reported in the

literature. The applicant has complied with the requirement of providing a paediatric investigation plan

(PIP). As part of the PIP, an oral suspension of the product is being developed. The applicant did not

seek scientific advice at the CHMP regarding this application.

-----

In accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Annex I, part II of the Directive

2001/83/EC the applicant applied for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The

applicant argued that he was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under

normal conditions of use because the indications for which cholic acid are intended are encountered so

rarely that he cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence. In addition, it would

also be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. The

applicant proposed as specific obligation to monitor the clinical safety and efficacy of cholic acid in the

treatment of the claimed bile acid deficiencies by establishing a patient registry.
##### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

Kolbam is presented as hard gelatine capsules containing 50 mg or 250 mg of cholic acid as the active

substance. The 50 mg strength is presented as size 2 capsules with Swedish orange caps (black

imprint “ASK001”) and bodies (black imprint “50mg”). The 250 mg strength is presented as size 0

capsules with white caps (black imprint “ASK002”) and bodies (black imprint “250 mg”).

Other ingredients are: silicified microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate (components of the

capsule contents), gelatin, titanium dioxide and red iron oxide (components of the capsule shells for

the 50 mg strength) or gelatin and titanium dioxide (components of the capsule shells for the 250 mg

strength). For the printing ink the excipients are shellac (E904), propylene Glycol (E1520), strong

Ammonia Solution (E527), potassium Hydroxide (E525), black Iron Oxide (E172).

The capsules are packed in white high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a white, child-resistant

closure (screw caps). **2.2.2. Active Substance **

Cholic acid is chemically designated as cholan-24-oic acid or (3α, 5, 7α, 12α)-3α, 7α, 12α-trihydroxy
5β-cholan-24-oic acid and has the following structure:

In nature, cholic acid is produced in the liver from cholesterol. The liver converts cholesterol into the

conjugated salts of glycocholic and taurocholic acid which are secreted into the bile. Bile is released

into the intestine where the bile salts emulsify fats and promote digestion. Cholic acid is produced from

bovine and ovine bile which is a by-product of the meat processing industry.

It is a white powder comprised of aggregated polycrystalline particles. It is practically insoluble in

water and in 0.1M HCl and is sparingly soluble in 0.1M NaOH. It is reported to be soluble in glacial

acetic acid and some organic solvents (e.g. alcohols, acetone). The saturated solution in water at 20°C

has a pH of 4.4. The substance is not hygroscopic unlike its sodium salt (sodium cholate). Cholic acid

has a melting point of approximately 200°C and is very heat stable.

-----

Sufficient evidence was provided to demonstrate that only one crystal form is obtained by the utilised

manufacturing process.

The applicant claimed that cholic acid should be classified as New Active Substance (NAS) and provided

justification for such claim. However the NAS status could not be confirmed because medicinal

products containing cholic acid have historically been used as laxatives and choleretics since at least

the early part of the 20 [th] century. Many of these products are no longer authorised but nevertheless as

previously authorised products they were relevant in determining the NAS status. Furthermore, during

evaluation of this application, another product containing cholic acid as the active substance has been

authorised. Therefore, it was concluded that as cholic acid was previously been authorised as a

medicinal product, it can not be considered a NAS.
##### ***Manufacture ***

Information about manufacturing process of cholic acid has been provided using Active Substance

Master File (ASMF) procedure.

Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a raw material. The safety of the bile with

regard to TSE is assured by the EDQM Certificate of Suitability. The applicant’s documentation included

details on slaughter, collection processes, geographical sourcing, and traceability. Bile is supplied as

either liquid bile or concentrated bile. Satisfactory specifications for these starting materials have been

provided.

Bile acids sourced from ox and sheep are rich in cholic acid conjugated to amino acids taurine and

glycine. The amino acids are removed from the cholic acid by hydrolysis under alkaline conditions.

Purification by precipitation and solvent extraction then occurs, before crystallisation and milling. The

manufacturing process has been well described. Critical parameters and accompanying in-process

controls to ensure quality of the final compound have been defined.

Confirmation of the chemical structure of cholic acid was provided by elemental analysis (confirmation

of the determined elementary composition), UV, FTIR, [1] H-NMR, [13] C-NMR, MS, X-ray powder diffraction

(XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). X-ray diffraction and DSC studies confirmed the

morphology of cholic acid and absence of polymorphic forms.

Potential impurities have been well discussed in relation to their origin (raw materials, manufacturing

process and degradation products) and potential carry-over into the final substance. The possibility of

genotoxic impurities was also addressed. Most of the impurities (chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic

acid, degraded bile salts, glycine, taurine, and other naturally occurring impurities) are naturally

occurring *in vivo* . As the active substance is being administered to correct bile acid deficiencies the

potential risk from these impurities would be no greater than present in healthy humans.

Particle size of the active substance is considered a critical attribute for the manufacture of the finished

product, as cholic acid is not dissolved in the dosage form. Therefore an appropriate test on particle

size determination was included in the active substance specification. ***Specification ***

The active substance specification includes tests for physical appearance, identification (FTIR and

HPLC), specific rotation, assay (HPLC), melting point, loss on drying, acidity, impurities (HPLC), residue

on ignition, colour index, heavy metals, particle size distribution, residual solvents (GC) and

microbiological purity (total aerobic microbiological count, yeasts and moulds, *Escherichia coli* ).

Limits proposed for known and unknown impurities are acceptable and in line with the ICH guideline

Q3A (R2). All impurities typically present in cholic acid at a level greater than 0.05% are reported and

those typically present at a level greater than 0.10% have been identified.

In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance.

Data on 3 consecutive commercial scale batches of cholic acid were provided by the ASMF Holder and

by the manufacturer of the finished product. All batches complied with the requirements in the active

substance specification.

In general, sufficient information regarding the manufacturing process, raw materials, critical steps

and intermediates and manufacturing process have been provided.
##### ***Stability ***

Stability data was provided from studies performed with different grade of the active substance

(grades 01 and 03). The grade 01, which is subject of this application, is obtained from the grade 03.

The 01 grade is subject to an additional re-crystallization and therefore is purer than the 03 grade.

For grade 01 stability data on three commercial scale batches performed in accordance to ICH

conditions were provided. Samples of cholic acid were placed under long term (25°C/60% RH),

intermediate (30°C/75% RH) and accelerated (40°C/75% RH) conditions. The batches were produced

by the proposed manufacturer and stored in the proposed container closure system. Results were

provided from up to 18 months of storage at long term and intermediate conditions and up to

9 months of storage at accelerated conditions.

For the 03 grade stability programme included full testing in accordance with ICH conditions. Results

were provided from up to 60 months of storage at 25°C/60% RH and up to 6 months of storage at

40°C/75% RH.

In both cases (grades 01 and 03) the batches were monitored for appearance, identification by HPLC,

loss on drying, assay, related impurities, microbial enumeration and colour index. All results reported

were within proposed specification limits. No trends were seen.

Although only 18 months stability was presented for the 01 grade it is considered that data from the

03 grade supports longer re-test period. This was considered acceptable because cholic acid is

extremely stable, there is no reason why the purer 01 grade would be less stable than the 03 grade

and the packaging for the 01 grade has been upgraded with the use of moisture resistant foil.

In addition stability data from forced degradation studies were provided. The following conditions were

studies: acid degradation (0.1 M and 1.0 M HCl) for up to 48 hours, alkaline degradation (0.1M and

1.0M NaOH) for up to 48 hours, oxidative degradation (5% H 2 O 2 ) for up to 72 hours and thermal

degradation (40°C) up to 93 hours. During stress studies cholic acid was shown to be stable in acidic,

alkaline and oxidative environment and also resistant to elevated temperatures.

The stability studies demonstrated that the active substance is stable and confirmed the proposed re
test period. Furthermore, one batch of cholic acid per year will be added to the stability program,

stored at 25°C/60% RH and tested annually for at least up to and including the re-test period. This

reduced (annual) testing protocol was accepted based on the integrity of the available data for cholic

acid. In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out of specification result or significant

negative trend will be reported.
##### **2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product ** ***Pharmaceutical Development ***

Only limited information was provided on pharmaceutical development of the finished product.

Development of the product began as a hospital special preparation.

The finished product, powder-filled capsules, is rather simple dosage form and no formal development

studies were performed. Initially powder filled capsules with the active substance and lactose mix were

made by the hospital pharmacy for the clinical investigations. This formulation was replaced by a to
be-marketed formulation, which is subject of this application. As there were no particular formulation

issues with the active substance, a simple capsule formulation could be employed. Standard well

known compendial excipients, commonly used in capsule formulations, were chosen for the formulation

and stability studies have been performed confirming there were no problems of compatibility of the

active substance with the excipients. In the to-be-marketed formulation lactose was replaced by

silicified microcrystalline cellulose as a filler and magnesium stearate added as a lubricant. The critical

component characteristics that can influence batch reproducibility, product performance, and finished

product quality are primarily rheological properties affecting blending and powder flow during filling

which were confirmed during process validation.

A relative bioavailability study was conducted to demonstrate similarity of the to-be-marketed

formulation to the clinical trial formulation. The two oral capsule formulations had similar PK profiles

although the standard criteria for bioequivalence were not met. Clinical trial/therapeutic equivalence

study was conducted to demonstrate similarity between formulations. Patients treated with the clinical

trial formulation were switched to the to-be-marketed formulation. The study was not specific to a

specific formulation in the same way that a bioequivalence study would be. Both strengths of capsule

and the sprinkle were considered in the therapeutic equivalence study. As the same powder mix is

used in both strengths of capsule it is considered that there is no difference in bioavailability between

the different strengths. The to-be-marketed formulation has been shown to be therapeutically

equivalent to a formulation shown to be effective clinically. The design of the study might not be as

clear cut as a standard bioequivalence study.

A suitable method for dissolution was developed and validated for routine control of the finished

product at release and shelf life. Specifications were defined and presented. A summary of the method

and method validation have been provided.

In addition, discussion about the palatibility and compatibility of the capsule contents mixed with some

types of foods or drinks was investigated. Mixing of the capsule contents is designed to mask any

unpleasant taste which results from the capsules being opened and to make the formulation age
appropriate in case of children who are not able to swallow oral solid dosage forms. This method of

administration has been used during the 20 years of product development as a hospital special. The

method of administration appears qualified by experience. The applicant has justified the size of

capsules in relation to the paediatric population and gave more guidance on how to administer the

product as a sprinkle. For infants, from one month of age, the contents of the capsules should be

mixed with a small amount of infant formula, expressed breast milk or fruit puree and given from a

spoon. In weaned infants and children under 6 years, who may be unable to swallow capsules, the

capsule contents should be mixed with a small amount of soft food such as mashed potatoes or apple

puree. This has been refelected in the Product inormation.

It can be concluded that the formulation development of the product was satisfactorily described.
##### ***Adventitious agents ***

Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a source material. The safety of the bile

with regard to TSE is assured by the Ph. Eur. Certificate of Suitability.

Among excipients used in the finished product only gelatin (component of the capsule shell) is of

animal origin. For gelatin TSE Certificates of Suitability were provided from suppliers.

Magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetal origin. ***Manufacture of the product ***

The manufacturing process is standard and relatively simple and includes sieving (the active substance

and the filler) followed by pre-lubrication and blending of the pre-lubrication blend with the lubricant

and filling of capsules.

The in-process controls were considered to be adequate as the mixing parameters are well defined in the

manufacturing process and the active substance constitutes substantial amount of the blend. Blend

uniformity and content uniformity were identified as critical process parameters which need to be

controlled as in-process controls. Satisfactory process validation data were provided. ***Product specification ***

The finished product specifications at release and shelf-life include tests for appearance, identification

(FTIR, melting point and HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances and

degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, water content (KF) and microbiological purity (total aerobic

viable count, total yeasts and moulds, *Escherichia Coli*, *Salmonella* ).

A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Complete method validation data was

provided for the non compendial ( *in-house* ) analytical methods.

Batch analysis results on batches of each strength of the finished product demonstrated compliance

with the proposed specification and confirmed consistency and uniformity of the product. The batches

were manufactured by the proposed manufacturer and packaged in the packaging intended for

commercial use.The results were consistent from batch to batch and proved that the product can be

manufactured reproducibly according to the agreed specifications. ***Stability of the product ***

Stability has been studied on 3 industrial scale batches of each strength of the finished product.

Stability data were generated using the storage conditions listed in the ICH Guidance and contained

results up to 24 months from long term storage at 25°C/60% RH and from storage under intermediate

conditions at 30°C/75% RH, and 6 months from accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% RH. The selection

of 30°C/75% RH as a long term condition was made to support the use of the product in hot and

humid climatic zones. As this storage condition is considered to be more challenging than

30°C/65% RH it was considered to be suitable as a long term storage conditions.

The following parameters were tested appearance, assay, water content, degradation products,

dissolution and microbiological attributes. No trends were observed in the data and all results complied

with the specification. No stability trends were observed for any of the attributes studied.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 15/97


-----

In addition stability data from photostability studies were provided. Studies were performed in

accordance with ICH Q1B. Formation of a degradation product in amounts above the qualification limit

was observed. This degradation product was not observed during long term or accelerated storage of

the finished product, and this indicates that the product should be protected from light. The storage

precaution “Store in original package in order to protect from light” has been added to the product

information.

It is foreseen that the capsule content could be mixed with a small amount of food or drinks to

facilitate the administration of the product to children who are not able to swallow capsules. Normally

stability studies would be required to support such claim in the SmPC. However in case of this product

stability studies were not required because stress testing has shown that cholic acid was resistant to

degradation by acid, base or oxidising agents. Furthermore cholic acid is a food additive (E1000, an

emulsifying agent) so presumably spends long periods in contact with food and it is an endogenous

substance secreted by the bile duct to digest food. It is not degraded by food but is subject to repeated

entero-hepatic circulation. If there were any degradants produced by contact with food they would be

qualified, as the degradation products would be endogenous substances.

The overall stability data showed that Kolbam is chemically, physically and microbiologically stable. The

results generated during the stability studies and statistical analyses support the proposed shelf life

and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC.
##### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The active substance, cholic acid, is a well-known and well-characterized substance. Information about

manufacturing process of cholic acid has been provided using Active Substance Master File (ASMF)

procedure. Cholic acid is manufactured using bovine and ovine bile as a source material and the safety

of the bile with regard to TSE is assured by the EDQM Certificate of Suitability. ASMF Holder has a long

experience in manufacture of cholic acid and has manufactured more than 10,000 batches of this

substance.

In general analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active substance.

Cholic acid was shown to be stable, even when stored at elevated temperatures.

The finished product is formulated as hard capsules. It is a simple formulation and only limited

information was provided on the formulation development. This was however acceptable in view of the

long record of use of the product and the bridging data to the applied formulation.

The method of manufacture is considered standard and has been satisfactorily described, including in
process tests. The data shows consistent manufacture and is considered sufficient for this

manufacturing process. The proposed specifications were justified based on the batch and stability

results, and are in general adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted.

The stability program is considered satisfactory. The batches placed on stability are considered

representative of the product to be marketed. The results generated during the stability studies

support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and overall

satisfactory documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the drug substance and the

drug product can be reproducibly manufactured and therefore the product should have a satisfactory

and uniform performance in the clinic.

##### ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in the application. The non-clinical data consists of

literature references published up to 2011. Due to the bibliographic nature of the data and the date of

origin of some of the studies the GLP statuses are not fully covered according to the present regulatory

standards. This is however acceptable as CA is an endogenous substance and has been investigated in

animals and humans over a considerable number of years without showing overt major toxicity. **2.3.2. Pharmacology ** ***Primary pharmacodynamic studies  ***

Cholic acid is synthesised in the liver from cholesterol. It undergoes enterohepatic circulation, in which

its principal functions include induction of bile flow; feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis;

modulation of cholesterol synthesis; elimination of cholesterol; and the facilitation of dispersion and

absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins through the formation of micelles (Setchell and O’Connell

2007). The effects of CA on the metabolism and secretion of bile acids are well known. Metabolism of

bile acids is tightly controlled via a negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. The cytochrome

P450 enzymes CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase) and CYP8B1 (sterol 12α-hydroxylase) that are

involved in bile acid synthesis are regulated by negative feedback from bile acids such as CA (Li
Hawkins *et al* . 2002; Murphy *et al* . 2005; Shea *et al* . 2007).

Several of the murine knock-outs models reviewed in the literature, targeting specific enzymes that in

humans result in inborn errors of bile acid synthesis, have not proven suitable as predictive animal

models. However, two murine models have been used to demonstrate that when bile acid synthesis

has been depressed, or the composition of the bile acid pool has been altered so that no CA is

available, dietary supplementation with CA can positively influence resultant pathologies. Mice deficient

in HSD3β7 (the homolog of the human gene coding for 3β-HSD), saw survival rates increase after

feeding with CA and vitamin supplements (Shea *et al* . 2007). The 3-hydroxyl group conferred by

HSD3β7 is required to maintain the functional and regulatory properties of bile acids in mice, and this

is similarly required in humans. In mice deficient with 12α-hydroxylase gene (CYP8B1) a similar

finding was seen (Murphy *et al* . 2005).

Taken together, the data from both studies demonstrated that in the HSD3B7 knock-out mouse (a

representative model for one of the documented errors of human bile acid biosynthesis) and in the

CYP8B1 knockout mouse (a surrogate model for inborn errors, in which CA is absent), CA,

supplemented in the diet, has the capacity to both prolong and maintain survival in addition to

preventing characteristic features of the phenotype in the HSD3B7 knockout mouse and to normalize

the absorption of cholesterol in a CYP8B1 knockout mouse that does not generate CA. The reported

actions of exogenous CA in both of these models support the use of CA in the treatment of inborn

errors of bile acid biosynthesis in patients. ***Secondary pharmacodynamic studies ***

No published studies have been identified by the applicant describing the secondary pharmacological

effects of CA. Cholic acid being an endogenous substance, no secondary pharmacological effects is

expected. The dose of bile acid administered is normally titrated against the extent of disappearance of

atypical bile acid intermediates and metabolites in urine, which correlate with the degree of

improvement in liver function tests. To date, no serious or persisting adverse effects following

administration of CA in therapeutic doses of up to 15 mg/kg body weight/day have been reported in

man. Data from animal toxicology studies suggest that there is no pharmacologic or toxic action of CA

outside the organs of the enterohepatic circulation (see toxicology section).
##### ***Safety pharmacology programme ***

CA has been used clinically to treat patients with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis since 1994. In

these patients, the dose of bile acid administered was titrated against the extent of disappearance of

atypical bile acid intermediates and metabolites in urine, which correlate with the degree of

improvement in liver function tests. To date, no serious or persisting adverse effects following

administration of CA in therapeutic doses of up to 13 mg/kg body weight/day for up to 15 years have

been reported in man (Gonzales *et al.* 2009). Consequently, formal safety studies examining the

effects of CA on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system in animals defined in ICH

Topic S7A Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/539/00) have not been

undertaken. Upon request the applicant provided the following review of the literature analysing

several pharmacology studies that have previously reported the effects of CA on potential target

systems.

Administration of CA (10 - 40 mg/kg i.v.) in the rat induced a negative chronotropic effect that was

dose dependent *in vitro* and reduced by atropine or vagotomy suggesting both a vagally mediated and

a direct effect on heart rate. The response was further diminished by ganglion blockade or

decerebration (Joubert 1978). In feline isolated right ventricular papillary muscles low concentrations

(3x10-9-3x10-7M) of CA induced a mild positive inotropic effect as well as an endocardial endothelium
dependent and β-receptor mediated positive inotropic response. Higher concentrations of CA (>3x10
7M ) or prolonged exposure to a single low concentration (3x10-8M) caused extensive morphological

damage to the endothelium (Colpaert *et al* . 1992).

Two separate studies examined the influence of bile acids, including CA, on the actions of isoprenaline,

adrenaline, noradrenaline and acetylcholine on the rat autonomic system on the heart *in vivo* and *in*

*vitro*, using an isolated blood vessel preparation (Kadlubowski *et al* . 1984) and isolated rat intestine

(Szkudlinski, 1984). Kadlubowski *et al* . reported that bile acids reduced the stimulating effect of

isoprenaline, adrenaline and noradrenaline on the rat heart. The spasmolytic effect of isoprenaline on

blood vessels was reduced but, the vasoconstrictor effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline were

enhanced. Furthermore, action of acetylcholine on the heart and blood vessels was reversed

(Kadlubowski *et al* . 1984). In a separate study, using isolated rat intestine, bile acids attenuated the

relaxant effect of isoprenaline and reversed the actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline. These

changes were suggested due to bile acids stimulating α-adrenoceptors whilst reducing stimulation at β
receptors. The actions of acetylcholine on the intestine were enhanced (Szkudlinski, 1984).

Furthermore, a study investigating the effects of CA on systolic blood pressure (SBP) in rats, that

received CA (80 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 30 days, reported an increased SBP from 95±9 to 123±10 mmHg

(n=7) (Wu *et al* .1999) and increased mesenteric pressor responses to norepinephrine *in vitro* . It is not

clear whether this effect was dose-related. The clinical relevance of these observations is unclear since

increases in blood pressure following administration of lower doses of CA have not been reported in

man.

Under normal conditions, the heart is exposed to concentrations of CA in the micromolar range, when

CA is confined to the enterohepatic circulation. However, this is 10 to 1000-fold below the

concentrations used in the experiments described above. Only under conditions of cholestasis or

continued CA acid administration does its concentration in peripheral blood approach these

concentrations. Such situations are considered unlikely to persist due to the self-limiting toxicity of CA

as evidenced by pruritus and diarrhoea as well as elevated serum bile acids, transaminases, and

particularly GGT (Güldütuna *et al* . 1993; Gonzales *et al* . 2009). Precautions against chronic overdose

have been specified in the SmPC (see section 4.8) and include regular monitoring of serum and urine

bile acid levels as well as liver parameters.
##### ***Pharmacodynamic drug interactions ***

No studies were performed or identified in the literature detailing possible pharmacodynamic drug

interactions of CA. Studies which describe the pharmacokinetic drug interactions with CA are discussed

in the section below. **2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics **

**Absorption**

The absorption of CA is well recognised and established. Following ingestion, absorption of CA will first

be by the small intestine, and is then transported to the liver by the blood for further processing.

Orally administered CA is absorbed by passive diffusion along the length of the gastrointestinal tract by

virtue of its hydrophobicity (Hofmann & Hagey, 2008; Keating *et al* . 2009). Following oral

administration of [14] C-cholic acid to rats, 85% of radioactivity was recovered in bile by 6 hours post
dose (Norman & Sjovall, 1958). More than 50% of administered radioactivity was recovered in bile

within 32 hours of a dose injected into the caecum. Once absorbed, exogenous CA enters into the

body’s bile acid pool and is likely to undergo multiple cycles of enterohepatic circulation. Following

intravenous administration of [14] C-cholic acid to healthy dogs (n=7), plasma concentrations of

radioactivity declined rapidly in a biphasic manner, with median half-lives of 1.5 and 7.6 minutes for

the first and second phase respectively (Bosje *et al* . 2005).

**Distribution**

In portal venous blood conjugated and unconjugated CA are 60-80% bound to protein (Hofmann &

Hagey, 2008). Cholic acid is mostly bound to albumin in human (Rudman & Kendall, 1956) and rat

serum (Fukuda & Iritani, 1981). Despite being highly albumin bound, bile acids, including conjugated

and unconjugated CA, are extracted from portal blood (Hofmann, 2007). Hepatocellular uptake of

conjugated CA is mainly mediated by sodium co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) [>75%], while

uptake of unconjugated CA is mainly mediated through Oatp1 and passive diffusion (Dawson *et al* .

2009; Hofmann & Hagey, 2008). Once inside the hepatocyte, unconjugated bile acids are conjugated

with taurine or glycine in a species dependent manner. Conjugated bile acids are actively transported

across the canalicular membrane via the bile salt excretory pump (BSEP) (Gerloff *et al* . 1998).

Following a single intravenous administration of CA (29 mg) to a pregnant ewe, a significant increase

was observed in the total bile acid concentration in foetal serum, indicating that despite a high hepatic

extraction and a low volume of distribution, placental transfer of CA is achieved (Perez *et al* . 1994).

**Metabolism**

Unconjugated bile acids entering the liver are almost entirely conjugated with taurine and/or glycine

via bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase, forming glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid as well as

glycochenodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid, before being secreted into bile. There

are large species differences in the ratio of bile acids conjugated with either taurine or glycine, ranging

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 19/97


-----

from exclusively with glycine in the rabbit to exclusively with taurine in the cat and dog (Zhang *et al* .

1992). Normal bile in the rat has a ratio of approximately 8:1 in favour of taurine conjugation, whereas

in human bile the ratio is in favour of glycine conjugation.

Upon secretion into the intestine, bile acids are largely reabsorbed in the ileum to return to the liver

via the portal blood. Primary bile acids that escape reabsorption into the colon are deconjugated and

converted to secondary bile acids through the action of intestinal bacteria. The most important reaction

in this context is the 7α-dehydroxylation where CA is converted to deoxycholic acid.

**Excretion**

Excretion studies in rat showed that CA is almost exclusively excreted in the faeces in the form of

metabolite. Only minor amounts of CA were found in the unconjugated form in rat faeces. Urinary

excretion of bile acids is minimal and in mice fed a 1% CA diet, the excretion of bile acids was 2000
fold higher in faeces than in urine (Soroka *et al* . 2011).

No data were presented on potential excretion of CA to milk in animals, however feeding pregnant and

nursing mice carrying a targeted inactivation of the HSD3B7 gene 0.1% or 0.5% CA during late

gestation and through postnatal day 28 resulted in an approximate doubling or normalisation,

respectively, of the survival frequency of homozygous mutant offspring mice (Shea *et al* . 2007). This

indicates that CA may be secreted in milk in mice.

**Pharmacokinetic drug interaction**

Oral administration of bile acids has been advocated as a mechanism for increasing the oral

bioavailability of poorly absorbed drugs (Mikov *et al* . 2006). In most cases this will be achieved by

enhanced micelle formation in the small intestine and hence the bile acids have been administered in

conjunction with other typical components of mixed micelles in order to achieve optimal effect.

The membrane permeability of clofazimine in a rat gut perfusion model was shown to be enhanced by

high concentrations of CA (80 mM), but not significantly altered at lower concentrations (O’Reilly *et al* .

1994). In rabbits, the systemic exposure to cefpirom following intra-duodenal administration (100

mg/kg) was increased approximately 5-fold by coadministration with CA (100 mg/kg) (Mrestani *et al* .

2003).

The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids involves several transporters and at least some of these also

transport a variety of drugs (Hofmann, 2007). Inhibition of bile salt excretory pump (BSEP) has been

implicated as a mechanism of drug-induced cholestasis, with several cholestatic drugs being shown to

be competitive inhibitors of BSEP in vitro (Pauli-Magnus *et al* . 2005). Using drug-induced inhibition of

fluorescent probe substrate transport across confluent monolayers of cells expressing BSEP, it has

been shown that several drugs inhibit BSEP, with cyclosporin A being the most potent tested (IC50 = 8

μM) (Wang *et al* . 2003). Cyclosporin A, along with other BSEP inhibitors such as troglitazone and

pravastatin, have been known to be responsible for clinical cases of drug-induced cholestasis, however,

in the case of pravastatin it has been questioned whether the relatively modest BSEP inhibition could

be responsible for clinical effect (Hirano *et al* . 2005).

##### **2.3.4. Toxicology **

Nonclinical toxicology of CA was reviewed in a series of publications. The GLP status of the studies

reviewed cannot be verified and in some cases pre-date implementation of this requirement. ***Single dose toxicity ***

No studies on the effects of CA after a single administration in animals have been performed or

identified in the literature. A single *in vitro* study investigating cytotoxicity of CA to hepatocytes has

been provided. In this study (Delzenne *et al* . 1992), isolated rat hepatocytes, at a density of 0.5x10 [6]

hepatocytes/mL, were incubated with either CA, deoxycholic acid (DCA) or lithocholic acid at

concentrations of 1 to 5 mM for 45 minutes. The percentage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage

into the medium was measured as an index of membrane integrity. Cholic acid caused a progressive

and time-dependant lytic effect at increasing concentrations between 1 and 5 mM, but was significantly

less toxic than DCA. ***Repeat dose toxicity ***

No new repeated-dose toxicity studies with CA were conducted. A review of the published literature

(seven studies) has been supplied examining effects in rats, hamsters, rabbits and primates.

**Table 1** **Repeated dose studies with cholic acid**

Saiful *et al* . 2011 showed significant reductions on epididymal adipose tissue and two other adipose

tissue was observed in rats fed 5 mmol/kg CA (equivalent to 2000 mg/kg/day). This appeared to be

associated with increased energy expenditure due to thyroid hormone activation by taurocholic acid

which was found at a high concentration in the faeces of rats. Serum adiponectin was also increase at

both 1.25 mmol/kg (equivalent to 500 mg/kg/day) but did not manifest in an inflammatory reaction on

the large intestinal mucosa. No clinical or histological (caecum & colon) effects were observed in this

study. No effect on body weight was noted.

In the Delzenne *et al* . 1992 publication, DCA was the most hepatotoxic and cholestatic compound while

CA represented the least hepatotoxic and cholestatic compound of the three examined. Significant

elevations of transaminases and total serum bile acids were only seen in rats fed with a diet

supplemented with 1% CA.

Spady *et al* . 1986 examined the effects of different bile salts on receptor dependent and independent

LDL uptake in the liver and intestines. The authors concluded that while CA has no acute, direct effect

on rates of receptor-dependent LDL transport or cholesterol synthesis, it can alter these processes

indirectly by inducing changes in cholesterol balance across the liver. The applicant argued that while

elevated plasma LDL-cholesterol levels caused by reduced hepatic receptor-dependent LDL uptake

after CA administration in human might be considered a long term risk to health, no changes in LDL
cholesterol levels were observed in 2 week clinical study in human volunteers, nor were there any

safety issues reported in long term treatment of patients with CA.

Wu *et al* . 1999 showed that systolic blood pressures were increased in Wistar rats treated with CA for 1

month. Pressor responses in isolated mesenteric arteries were significantly higher in the arteries

treated with CA while the production of aldosterone in mesenteric artery perfusates treated with CA

was decreased, but that of corticosterone was increased compared to those of controls. The author

concluded that the altered autocrine system in vessels may potentiate the development of

hypertension induced by CA.

In the Rosenman *et al* . 1953 publication hypercholesteremia and increased plasma phospholid levels

were evident in rats treated with both CA and cholesterol together – CA by itself did not induce such

increases. No atherosclerosis was seen in any of the rat aortas examined. In rabbits however,

moderate hypercholesteremia was seen in animals receiving CA alone and was associated with

scattered atherosclerotic plaques in the aortas examined.

In Webster *et al* . 1975, rhesus monkeys gained weight during the treatment period but with the lack of

contemporaneous controls, no effect of CA treatment could be discerned. Biliary bile acid composition

was significantly altered compared to control level, DCA was found to be 10-fold higher than untreated

controls, while the level of CA was found to be around 50% of control levels. No increase in serum

triglycerides or serum cholesterol was evident and liver morphology was unaffected by treatment.

Overall, no evidence of toxicity was observed in repeat dose oral dietary studies in rats (up to

approximately 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately 50 times the therapeutic dose in humans),

approximately 100 mg/kg/day in hamsters (approximately 5 times the therapeutic dose),

approximately 500 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 25 times the therapeutic dose) and at

approximately the therapeutic dose (20 mg/kg/day) in primates. Limited parameters were investigated

in these studies and histology was often not performed. However, these data support the

administration of CA orally for up to 26 weeks during which time CA was well tolerated with no

mortalities, no apparent effects on bodyweight or food consumption and no evidence of significant

macroscopic or microscopic findings in the liver.
##### ***Genotoxicity ***

The applicant has performed no new genotoxicity studies for CA and has provided a review of available

literature for CA.

*In vitro*

In Watabe and Bernstein *et al* . 1985 the authors concluded that CA, deoxycholic acid and

chendeoxycholic acid were mutagenic for both TA98 and TA100, however, from the data presented,

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 22/97


-----

the number of revertant colonies did not increase in a dose-dependent manner, and often the highest

dose level tested was actually comparable with control. Vernit *et al* . 1987 showed that at the

concentrations tested, there were no dose-related, statistically significant increases in mutagenicity

compared to controls for both TA98 and TA100. These results did not support the claim of Watabe and

Bernstein, 1985, that these bile acids are mutagenic. Mori *et al.* 1991 tested CA in the fluctuation test

at concentrations up to 75 µg/mL using 50/50 ethanol/water, ethanol and DMSO as solvents and

showed no evidence for mutagenicity with TA98 and TA100. Overall, the weight of published evidence

would point to CA not being mutagenic. It is acknowledged that genotoxicity studies were not

completed according to OECD 471 or ICH S2 (R1) guidelines. Irrespective of whether the genotoxicity

testing was conducted fully in accordance with these guidelines, the dose of CA to be administered to

the patients is intended to restore a concentration that is equivalent to that physiologically present in

healthy humans. Therefore any perceived genotoxic risk from CA and deoxycholic acid to the patients

would be equivalent to that of a normal healthy adult that produces these bile acids intrinsically.

Overall, CA showed non significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed *in*

*vitro* .

*In vivo*

No *in vivo* data has been identified in the literature. Cholic acid being an endogenous substance it

cannot be considered to be genotoxic at physiological concentrations and the lack of *in vivo*

genotoxicity data is justified. According to the “Note for guidance on genotoxicity (ICH S2(R1) or

EMEA/CHMP/ICH/126642/2008) there are compounds for which standard *in vivo* tests do not provide

additional useful information. Cholic acid can be considered such a compound, in addition CA has been

shown to not interact with DNA via adduct formation (Scates *et al* . 1995).
##### ***Carcinogenicity ***

No long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of CA or other bile acids have been identified in the literature.

A study was presented in a carcinogenicity model where a known carcinogen was given to initiate the

formation of tumours. In McSherry *et al* . 1989, ten groups of male Fischer 344 rats were fed a basal

diet supplemented with CA (0.2%) and/or calcium (1.6%) throughout the 28 week study period. On

study Days 1 and 4, all animals were administered intrarectally with either N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea

(MNU) at 2mg/dose or saline (control). At the end of the 28 week period, no tumours were observed in

the groups receiving only saline, which included a group supplemented with CA alone. CA did however

increase the incidence of tumour formation from 55% to 80% in the MNU treated animals.

Overall, the results showed a carcinogenic promotion potential that is carcinogen dependent. No

carcinogenic effects were seen under CA treatment without the addition of the carcinogen. Despite

this, it is not possible to eliminate bile acids from human metabolism as they play a vital role.

Elevated gastrointestinal bile acid concentrations are probably best regarded as a potential risk factor

for gastrointestinal cancer. In the case for treatment to patients with inborn errors in bile acid

synthesis the restoration of normal, functional enterohepatic circulation, absorption of fat and fat
soluble vitamins together with the long-term survival and avoidance of liver disease (risk of

carcinogenicity in itself) largely outweighs the potential risk of carcinogenicity. Long-term monitoring of

the risk for carcinogenicity is included as an element in the Risk Management Plan. ***Reproduction Toxicity ***

No studies examining the effects on pre-natal, early embryonic and post natal development have been

identified in the literature. Cholic acid has been showed to be present in foetal blood and to pass the

placenta sheep (Perez *et al* . 1994; Campos *et al* . 1986). Administration of a single dose of CA

intravenously to pregnant ewes in late gestation demonstrated systemic exposure of CA in the foetus

with no effect on the mortality and general wellbeing (cardiovascular parameters) of the foetus or the

mother, and following birth the offspring appeared normal (Perez *et al* . 1994). When given after at the

end of gestation, uterine contractions were observed coinciding with the increase in maternal and

foetal plasma bile acid levels with labour occurring within 24 hours of administration. However, the

foetuses delivered appeared normal. A similar study, in pregnant ewes (Campos *et al* . 1986), also

demonstrated an increase in early deliveries (19-26 days early) following intravenous CA

administration on Day 124 of gestation (normal gestation period 150 days). No nonclinical studies were

identified investigating the effects of the use of CA during lactation and paediatric development. From

a mouse study examining deficiency of the HSD3B7 gene, there is evidence that CA is secreted in

murine milk and has beneficial effect in inborn error of primary bile acid synthesis (Shea *et al* . 2007).
##### ***Toxicokinetic data ***

No toxicokinetic data has been provided or identified in the literature. Due to the amount of clinical

data available on CA, the absence of animal data is acceptable. ***Local Tolerance ***

No studies were identified investigating local tolerance. As the administration roure is oral, dedicated

studies are not considered relevant. ***Other toxicity studies ***

*Metabolites*

Deoxycholic acid is the main metabolite of CA. Deoxycholic acid has for a number of years been

recognized as highly hepatotoxic *in vivo* in rats and cytotoxic *in vitro* in cultured rat hepatocytes

(Delzenne *et al.* 1992), probably by its potential to induce lipid peroxidation. Mori *et al.* 1991

confirmed that deoxycholic acid does not induce mutagenicity *in vitro* in 2 bacterial strains, but more

recently, Bernstein *et al.* 2011a revealed that high physiologic concentrations of deoxycholic acid

induce the formation of reactive oxygen species with increased DNA damage, mitotic aberrations and

development of resistance to apoptosis *in vitro* . *In vivo* supplementation of 0.2% deoxycholic acid to

the diet of mice for up to 10 months (resulting in levels of deoxycholic acid in the faeces similar to

those of humans eating a high fat diet) induced colonic tumours indicating that deoxycholic acid can

act as a carcinogen under certain conditions. Therapeutic administration of CA is intended to restore

bile acid concentration equivalent to those physiologically present in healthy humans. Therefore any

perceived toxicity risk from deoxycholic acid would be equivalent to that in healthy adults producing

normal levels of bile acids intrinsically. Delzenne *et al* used dose levels in vivo of 0.5 and 1% of the

daily diet which, taking average daily consumption for a rat to be 20 g, is equivalent to 0.1-0.2g/day,

or 400-800 mg/kg/day; far in excess of the therapeutic CA dose of 10 15 mg/kg/day. The *in vitro*

cytotoxicity reported by Delzenne *et al* was observed over a deoxycholic acid concentration range of 1
5 mM (1000-5000 µmol/L), again far in excess of the expected human plasma concentration of 1

µmol/L. These findings are therefore not considered relevant to CA supplementation for the treatment

of inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. Furthermore, Gonzales *et al* . 2009 demonstrated that

treatment with CA (13.4 mg/kg tapering to 6 mg/kg) in children with inborn errors of bile acid

metabolism for an average of 12.4 years was well tolerated, safe and effective, with no evidence of

tumour formation in liver biopsies.

The limit for impurity methyl cholate has been tightened. Methyl cholate did not cause significant

numbers of revertants of Salmonella strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1438, TA98 and TA100 in an Ames

assay, indicating no potential for mutagenicity (McDonald *et al.* 1978). This is in excess of methyl

cholate concentrations found at maximal daily dose of Kolbam. Kolbam is available in 50 mg and 250

mg capsules and will be administered at doses no higher than 15 mg/kg/day. To a 70 kg human this

represents a maximum CA dose of 1050 mg and hence total daily intake of methyl cholate no higher

than 2.1 mg. This is well below the ICH Q3 thresholds for toxicological evaluation and it is accepted

that cholesterol synthesis of patients would not be adversely affected at this concentration.

At least 15 patients reported by Gonzales *et al.* 2009, have been treated, most of them for more than

10 years, with CA preparations that have contained between 0.4 to 0.5% of methyl cholate. No

adverse events have been reported in this population at therapeutic doses of CA.
##### **2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

Given that CA is an endogenous bile acid and a physiological substance in mammals, it would occur

naturally in the environment as faeces. Therefore, it is exempt from the requirement of an ERA in line

with the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the medicinal products for human use”

(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) **2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

The effects of CA on the metabolism and secretion of bile acids are well known. Metabolism of bile

acids is tightly controlled via a negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis. The cytochrome

P450 enzymes CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase) and CYP8B1 (sterol 12α-hydroxylase) that are

involved in bile acid synthesis are regulated by negative feedback from bile acids such as CA. Mice

deficient in HSD3β7 (the homolog of the human gene coding for 3β-HSD), saw survival rates increase

after feeding with CA and vitamin supplements. The 3-hydroxyl group conferred by HSD3β7 is required

to maintain the functional and regulatory properties of bile acids in mice, and this is similarly required

in humans. In mice deficient with 12α-hydroxylase gene (CYP8B1) a similar finding was seen. Only one

primary enzyme defect has been addressed, HSD3β7 deficiency, while the use of CYP8B1 is used as a

surrogate model for CYP7B1 (Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase) deficiency. Indeed polymorphisms of CYP8B1

have not been associated with any disease in man. Although, the CHMP considered that the

pharmacology data to support the claimed indications for treatment of inborn errors of primary bile

acid synthesis was very limited, it was acknowledged that patients with inborn errors of bile acid

synthesis have received successful CA treatment for over 20 years.

No studies have been presented describing the secondary pharmacological effects of CA. Cholic acid

being an endogenous substance, no secondary pharmacological effects is expected. No formal safety

pharmacology studies have been performed with CA. The applicant has presented initially minimal

study data to address safety pharmacology of CA, focussing predominantly on the cardiovascular

findings from a rat study performed in 1999. Wu *et al* . 1999 have reported increased SBP and

mesenteric pressor responses following administration of CA (80 mg/kg p.o.) for 30 days in the rat.

However, the clinical relevance of these observations is uncertain since increases in blood pressure

following administration of lower doses of CA have not been reported in man. During the procedure the

applicant provided a comprehensive and acceptable review of the non-clinical findings for safety

pharmacology. No other findings were identified. In addition, no concerns were raised from a safety

pharmacology standpoint. In addition clinical experience for CA has been gained in patients and to date,

no serious or persisting adverse effects following administration of CA in therapeutic doses of up to 15

mg/kg body weight/day have been reported in man.

The pharmacokinetics of CA is well recognised and established. The applicant provided satisfactory

literature review concerning the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of CA. No data

has been presented on potential excretion of CA to milk in animals, however indications following

feeding pregnant and nursing mice carrying a targeted inactivation of the HSD3B7 gene 0.1% or 0.5%

CA during late gestation and through postnatal day 28 resulted in an approximate doubling or

normalisation, respectively, of the survival frequency of homozygous mutant offspring mice (Shea *et al* .

2007). This indicates that CA is excreted in milk in mice. This was reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC.

Cholic acid and drugs that strongly interact with BSEP (cyclosporine A, troglitazone and pravastatin),

together both substances interfere with the transport of CA. Inhibition of BSEP has been implicated as

a mechanism of drug-induced cholestasis. Actions of clofazimine (membrane permeability) and

cefpirom appear to be enhanced with co-administration with CA. The SmPC contains appropriate

warnings over drug-drug interactions and further non-clinical data are not needed.

Toxicities studies from published literature have been summarised and reviewed by the applicant in

rats, hamsters, rabbits and primates. The studies reviewed are of small size and systematic dosing

data is not available. No toxicokinetic data has been provided and the toxicity findings in the studies

were not particularly detailed. The results presented showed that CA administered to animals was

generally well tolerated with no evidence of mortalities, no major effects on bodyweight or food

consumption and no evidence of significant macroscopic or microscopic findings in the liver. This was

at doses up to 50-fold the therapeutic dose in humans for up to 26 weeks in duration. In general the

target organs for toxicity for CA are in the enterohepatic circulation, the liver and the administration

caused diarrhoea. Although not discussed by the applicant, in an eight month feeding study

(Beasancon *et al.* 1970), in combination with a high-cholesterol containing diet, CA administration

leads to increased liver weight and the formation of gallstones in mice. The basis for this toxic effect

appears to be related to a particular combination of metabolically related substances. The formation of

gallstones has been linked to the cholesterol super-saturation of bile provoked by this diet. Overall, the

CHMP concluded that due to the amount of clinical data available on CA, the absence of robust animal

data was considered acceptable.

A number of studies have shown conflicting evidence as to whether CA is genotoxic and whether it has

mutagenic potential. The *Salmonella tyrphimurium* and Ames test has been used to evaluate the

mutagenic potential of CA. The positive results seen in the fluctuation assay by Watabe and Bernstein

have been challenged by Venitt *et al.* 1987 and Mori *et al.* 1991. It is acknowledged that genotoxicity

studies were not completed according to OECD 471 or ICH S2 (R1) guidelines and this has been

adequately justified by the applicant. Overall, CA showed non significant mutagenic activity in a

battery of genotoxicity tests performed *in vitro* .

Animal models indicated that administered bile acids show carcinogenic promotion potential and that

this is carcinogen dependent. No carcinogenic effects were seen under CA treatment without the

addition of carcinogens. Despite this, it is not possible to eliminate bile acids from human metabolism

as they play a vital role. Elevated gastrointestinal bile acid concentrations are probably best regarded

as a potential risk factor for gastrointestinal cancer. In the case for treatment to patients with inborn

errors in bile acid synthesis the restoration of normal, functional enterohepatic circulation, absorption

of fat and fat-soluble vitamins and long-term survival largely outweighs the potential risk of

carcinogenicity. As conservative approach, given the limited data provided the risk of carcinogenicity is

added as potential risk in the RMP and the applicant will monitor the risk on the long term a part of the

patients’ registry.

Studies with high dose CA have been reviewed in sheep. There was no evidence of systemic exposure

of CA in the foetus, and no effect of teratogenicity was observed. There was increased incidence of

early deliveries, however no further fertility, embryo-foetal of post natal developmental effects were

observed. Further evidence, from hamsters (Siviero *et al* . 2008) and chickens (Verrett *et al* . 1980)

showed no adverse or teratogenic effects to foetus following administration of CA. Overall, animal

studies showed that CA did not induce any teratogenic effect or foetal toxicity. No data on the effects

of CA on fertility are available. Clinical data from Gonzales *et al* (2009) included two women treated

with CA therapy having four normal pregnancies.
##### **2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

The applicant submitted no new non-clinical study in support of this application. The nonclinical data

have been compiled from published literature as CA is an endogenous product and has been

investigated in animals and humans over a considerable number of years. Since 1992 CA has been

administered to infants with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis and been shown to be an effective

treatment. The extensive literature review of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of CA

was considered appropriate and acceptable to support the non-clinical aspect of Kolbam. For the

majority of cited literature the GLP status of the studies cannot be verified as either they pre-date the

implementation of GLP requirements or no information on GLP status was available. In view of the

available data from use of CA in humans, both for the treatment of various medical conditions as well

as non-medical use, and taken into account the endogenous nature of the substance, the CHMP

considers the lack of confirmation of the GLP status acceptable.

The analysed non-clinical data from the literature reveal no special hazard for humans based on

studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to

reproduction. The review of the studies has taken into account that CA is a physiological substance in

animals and humans.

CA showed non significant mutagenic activity in a battery of genotoxicity tests performed *in vitro* . Data

reviewed suggest that CA does not act as a carcinogen *per se* but as a promoter of carcinogenicity only

following treatment with an alkylating agent. Evidence for a tumour-promoting potential of some bile

acids, particularly deoxycholic acid, have been shown. Animal studies showed that CA did not induce

any teratogenic effect or foetal toxicity. No data on the effects of CA on fertility are available. At

therapeutic doses, no effect on fertility is anticipated. Animal studies did not indicate reproductive

toxicity; however, one study showed that when administered intravenously to pregnant ewes in late

stage gestation, CA appeared to induce premature labour. Any similar risk in pregnant women

receiving the recommended oral dose of CA is unlikely. Slightly increased blood pressure was evident

in rats after 30 days of CA at approximately 4 fold therapeutic dose with increased vasoconstrictor

responses to norepinephrine, together with decreased levels of aldosterone and increased

corticosterone, but no adverse clinical signs were observed. As conservative approach, given the

limited data provided, the long-term monitoring for the potential risks of carcinogenicity, reproductive

toxicity and elevated systolic blood pressure are included as an element in the Risk Management Plan.

Available data in animals have shown excretion of CA in milk. At therapeutic doses, no effects on the

breast-fed newborn infant are anticipated. Cholic acid can be used during breast-feeding.

##### ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction ** ***GCP ***

The academic, investigator-initiated study CAC-91-10-10 and its sub-study CAC-92-8-19 were started

in 1992, prior to the initiation of global GCP requirements. Although the program was subject to the

institution’s internal IRB, the studies were not conducted according to currently applied GCP standards.

While the original protocols were reviewed and approved by the IRB, the amendments to the studies

were only reported to the IRB via letters or changes to the informed consent documentation. No formal

protocol amendment was provided until June 2010, after the data cut-off point for the final CAC-91-10
10 study report. Thus in order to verify the robustness of the data supporting this application the CHMP

required a GCP inspection to be conducted. The inspection (INS/GCP/2012/016) identified 4 critical

findings relating to data integrity, clinical study report, investigational medicinal products and reliability

of laboratory data. There were 8 major findings relating to trial documents, sponsor oversight, protocol

compliance, oversight of the follow up of trial patients, data management, efficacy source data,

pharmacovigilance and monitoring. There were 2 minor findings relating to trial documents and data

management. The principal outcome of the inspection was that the data and corresponding clinic study

report (CSR) were not reliable, not complete, did not reflect the actual conduct of trial in sufficient

details and were regarded as unsuitable for assessment.

During the procedure the applicant addressed the inspection findings and provided a revised CSR for

which an extensive re-monitoring of the study data was performed resulting in an increased reliability

of the data integrity. As a result of the re-monitoring, more patients could be included in the analysis.

In addition, sensitivity analyses comprising additional data analysis sets and subpopulation analyses

were performed to further investigate the robustness of the results. The results of the revised CSR are

presented in this report. The limitations of this non-compliant academic trial, and start date has to be

balanced against the orphan designation status of CA. Despite a non-optimal documentation of study

data due to the early stage academic nature of the study and the long-term study period, the results

presented consistently show improvements in all efficacy parameters analyzed and across the majority

of subpopulations and analysis sets. Even given the sparseness of data documentation, GCP lapses and

remaining uncertainties in data integration, the CHMP considered that this is the consistency and

maintenance of improvement in patients’ symptoms that provides evidence of the therapeutic efficacy

of CA in the treatment of patients with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis (see efficacy section).

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials CAC-001-01 conducted outside

the community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

##### **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

The applicant has provided a literature review of studies on bile acid kinetics and conducted a

bioavailability study in order to show similarity between the formulations used in the pivotal trial CAC
91-10-10 and the formulation of Kolbam intended for marketing.

The kinetics and dynamics of CA have generally been studied as an endogenous molecule and to a

much lesser degree as an exogenously administered pharmacological agent. Its pharmacokinetic

characteristics and metabolism are different from that of a conventional synthetic small molecule in

that once administered, any exogenous CA will behave like an endogenous molecule. This is

particularly true since exogenous oral CA will simply enter the normal enterohepatic circulation of

endogenous bile acids. Data on the kinetics and dynamics of endogenous CA thus provides relevant

information on the clinical pharmacology of exogenously administered CA.

Cholic acid is subject to first-pass hepatic extraction and enterohepatic recirculation. To provide an

accurate determination of the absorption kinetics, blood samples would be required from the portal

vein, which is not feasible or ethical except during surgical interventions (Angelin *et al.* 1982).

Peripheral plasma sampling is useful primarily for studying relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of

bile acids that have a low endogenous concentration (Setchell, 2004).

The bile acid pool is largely confined within the enterohepatic circulation and there is poor systemic

distribution, resulting in low total serum bile acid concentrations of about 1-12 µmol/L. The total bile

acid concentration in human peripheral serum fluctuates in relation to meal intake between 2-5 µM

during night time (fasting) lows to 10-16 µM during daytime highs (Everson, 1987). In the hepatic

venous portal plasma (i.e. within the enterohepatic circulation), fasting CA concentration averaged

6.13 ± 2.57 µmol/L while maximum postprandial concentrations averaged 18.42 ± 4.17 µmol/L

(Angelin *et al.* 1982). Cholic acid is present in serum and plasma of normal humans, including children

and pregnant women (Barth *et al.* 2005), in a range beween 0.05-6.7 µmol/L. Values for normal

children are broadly in the same range as for healthy adults. As noted above, serum bile acid

concentrations vary considerably over the day and in relation to meal intake, so this broad normal

range may be expected. Cholic acid concentration (as its glycocholic acid and taurocholic acid

conjugates) in gallbladder bile is in the range of 4-74 mmol/L (Perwaiz *et al.* 2001) and it constitutes

about 35% of gallbladder and hepatic bile (Ahlberg *et al.* 1981). ***Absorption ***

Because it is hydrophobic, CA is absorbed rapidly by passive non ionic diffusion. Once absorbed,

exogenously administered CA becomes part of the bile acid pool. The CA pool size has been measured

in healthy adult volunteers using a stable isotope dilution/GLC/MS technique (Stellard *et al.* 1984;

Everson, 1987; Koopman *et al.* 1988) and a microscale stable isotope dilution/GLC/electron capture

negative chemical ionization-MS technique (Hulzebos *et al.* 2001). In a healthy adult of 60 kg body

weight, the pool size of CA (and its conjugates) is approximately 600-750 mg.

Study CAC-003-001 title: Comparative bioavailability of three formulations of CA in healthy male

subjects using a multiple dose repeated measures approach

The study was a single-centre Phase I study of multiple oral doses without wash-out to compare the

bioavailability of a 250 mg oral capsule (Pharmacy capsule formulation used in the pivotal clinical study

CAC-91-10-10) to a 250 mg capsule (cGMP capsule: intended commercial formulation of Kolbam) and

to an oral solution or suspension (250 mg) at steady state using a fully randomised replicate dose

design. The objective of this study was to evaluate the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of multiple

oral doses of CA in 18 healthy male volunteers. In addition, the safety of CA was assessed following

multiple dose administration of CA.

The CA concentration-time profiles for the 3 formulations were similar. Comparison of Treatment B

(cGMP capsule formulation) to Treatment A (Pharmacy formulation) demonstrated only slight

differences in bioavailability. Comparison of the two oral 250 mg capsule formulations with the oral

250 mg solution (Treatment C) revealed significantly greater bioavailability for the capsules relative to

the solution. In terms of CA, Treatment B (cGMP formulation) had slightly greater bioavailability (10%)

when compared to Treatment A (Pharmacy formulation) with the 90% C.I. = 1.03 – 1.175 for AUCtau;

whereas for ‘total CA’ the differences in AUCtau was only 5.7% with 90 % C.I. = 1.007 – 1.11.

Assessment of the CA Cmax ratios for the cGMP capsule versus the Pharmacy capsule revealed a 90%

CI that fell outside the 0.80 to 1.25 CI limits. A similar lack of bioequivalence for the cGMP capsule

versus the Pharmacy capsule was seen for Total CA Cmax. Assessment of the CA and ‘total CA’ AUCtau

ratios for the two oral capsules versus the oral solution revealed lack of bioequivalence with the 90%

CIs falling outside the acceptable limits of 0.80 to 1.25. Assessment of the CA and ‘total CA’ Cmax

Based upon the steady state levels of all ‘active CA analytes’ i.e., C ratios for the oral capsules versus

the oral solution demonstrated bioequivalence for the Pharmacy capsule versus the solution (90% CI =

0.857 to 1.019) but not for the cGMP capsule versus the solution (90% CI = 1.059 to 1.26).

Based upon the steady state levels of all ‘active CA analytes’ i.e., Cmin and AUCtau values for ‘total

CA’ the MAH concluded that these two capsule formulations (Treatment A and Treatment B) are

equally bioavailable. With regards to CA levels, Treatment B, (cGMP formulation) resulted in only a

slightly greater level of CA (AUCtau ratio = 1.10), but a 17.9% and 23.7% greater Cmax value for

‘total CA’ and CA respectively when compared to Treatment A. These differences in Cmax levels are

not clinically relevant since CA safety and efficacy does not depend upon rate of absorption and in

clinical practice dose is based on titration to effect in the individual patient.

The recommended initial dosage for CA in treatment of patients with inborm errors of bile acid

metabolism is a range from 10-15 mg/kg/day. Then, patients are appropriately managed by titration of

the dose over time to achieve optimal ALT and suppression of toxic atypical bile acid intermediates.

Therefore, the observed differences in the PK parameters of the two formulations are not of clinical

significance in terms of safety or efficacy, and the data from prior use of the Pharmacy formulation is

considered similar to the current cGMP formulation.

**Influence of food**

The effect of food on the bioavailability of CA has not been studied. Because of the hydrophobic nature

of CA, it is theoretically possible that the presence of food may enhance the absorption, and thus the

bioavailability, if both are administered concurrently. The day-to-day variation in the amount of a dose

absorbed is expected to be mitigated by the long residence of bile acids in the enterohepatic

circulation. It is also possible that tolerability may be improved when CA is administered with food

therefore recommended administering CA capsules together with food as reflected in section 4.2 of the

SmPC.
##### ***Distribution ***

The volume of distribution of exogenously administered CA has not been characterized because of its

enterohepatic distribution along with other bile acids. Bile acid kinetics have been reported in terms of

pool size and fractional turnover rate (Crosignani *et al.* 1996). Conventional calculation of volume of

distribution has been reported as 1.879 ± 0.054 L/m [2] (Gilmore and Thompson, 1980). The bile acid

pool is largely confined within the enterohepatic circulation and there is poor systemic distribution,

resulting in low serum bile acid concentrations (about 5 µM) (Gilmore and Thompson, 1980; Everson,

1987; Crosignani *et al.* 1996). Serum bile acid concentrations fluctuate during the day as a function of

meal intake and bile secretion (Everson, 1987). In untreated patients with inborn errors of bile acid

synthesis, total serum bile acid concentrations are usually in the normal range or lower (Gonzales *et al.*

2009). However due to the metabolic defect in these patients, primary bile acids, including CA, are

absent or present only at trace concentrations. This is resolved after treatment with primary bile acids,

when the administered bile acids and their secondary metabolites predominate (Ichimiya *et al.* 1991;

Clayton *et al.* 1995; Gonzales *et al.* 2009). Plasma has a very high binding capacity for bile acids and

the binding shows rapid equilibrium. Serum albumin binds approximately 95% of the total CA

concentration via the primary site for CA. ***Elimination ***

The metabolism of exogenously administered CA in patients with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis is

not expected to differ qualitatively that in normal subjects. The metabolism of CA to secondary bile

acids takes place in the intestine by intestinal bacteria and is not affected by hepatic enzyme defects,

i.e. is the same in normal subjects and patients with enzyme defects. In patients with inborn errors of

bile acid synthesis who are administered CA, urine and bile contained predominantly CA and

deoxycholic acid (Gonzales *et al.* 2009).

Cholic acid clearance has been reported in healthy volunteers and cirrhotic patients (Kaye *et al.* 1973).

In both groups, during fasting, the curve for disappearance of radioactivity from the serum during the

first 100 min after [ [14] C] CA injection was double-exponential in form. During the early phase, clearance

was significantly more rapid, and concentrations of conjugated and free bile acid were significantly

lower in healthy volunteers than in cirrhotic patients. Radioactivity disappeared from the systemic

circulation of healthy volunteers within 3 hours. Intravenous and oral clearance of CA was quantified

and found to be 271 ± 15 ml/min/m [2] and 1248 ± 104 ml/min/m [2], respectively (Gilmore and

Thompson, 1980). In patients with various hepatic diseases (cirrhosis, icteric and anicteric liver

disease, hepatitis), these clearances were significantly reduced.

The half-life of CA is approximately 27 hours (Crosignani *et al.* 1996). Approximately 5% of the bile

acid pool enters the colon and provides a substrate for intestinal microbes, leading to formation of the

secondary bile acids deoxycholic and lithocholic acids that are the major bile acids in faeces. The daily

excretion of urinary bile acids was determined to be 7.0 ± 0.8 µmol per 24 hours and was independent

of the 24-hour urine volume (Alme *et al.* 1977). In this study, CA comprised 2-7% of the total bile

acids. The remainder of the total urinary bile acids constituted a broad spectrum of other bile acid

metabolites. Other studies reported a lower urinary excretion of bile acids (<1µmol/day) (Bernstein *et*

*al.* 2005). Given a daily total synthesis rate of approximately 10 µmol/kg body weight per day which

quantitatively replaces the amount lost by excretion, renal excretion is therefore a minor (≤1%)

elimination route for CA and its metabolites. Overall, in subjects with normal liver function, bile acids

-----

including CA are excreted in the urine in negligible amounts (Alme *et al.* 1977). In the context of

cholestasis, when plasma bile acid concentrations are increased, renal excretion is also significantly

increased. This is the case in untreated patients with 3ß-HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiencies. Bile salts,

including cholate, are a normal component of human breast milk (Forsyth *et al.* 1983).
##### ***Dose proportionality and time dependencies ***

This has not been specifically studied or discussed. No discussion is required as this issue does not

generate safety concerns. ***PK in target population ***

No population PK studies have been provided for CA in the treatment of the claimed bile acids

deficiencies. Cholic acid dosage is established individually for each patient based on their

pharmacodynamic response, both at the initiation and regularly during maintenance of treatment.

Therefore such studies are not considered as providing any additional information for the dosage

recommendations or the safe and effective use of CA, regardless of possible inter- and intrasubject

variations in pharmacokinetics. ***Special populations ***

**Impaired renal function**

There are no reports on the use of CA for the treatment of inborn errors of bile acid metabolism in

patients with renal impairment in CAC-91-10-10 or in the published literature. Under normal

physiological conditions, excretion of bile acids occurs almost exclusively in the faeces. Accordingly,

bile acids including CA are excreted in the urine in negligible amounts (Alme *et al* . 1977) and

compromise of renal function would not be expected to result in systemic accumulation and toxicity. In

case of cholestasis, such as in patients with untreated inborn errors of bile acid metabolism, serum

concentrations of bile acids are increased and renal excretion is proportionately increased. For patients

with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that are successfully treated with CA, the development of

renal failure may have little to no impact on systemic bile acid concentrations. However, these patients

should be carefully monitored and the dose of CA titrated individually.

**Impaired hepatic function**

Cholic acid is synthesized endogenously in the liver and metabolized to secondary bile acids in the

intestine by intestinal bacteria. Metabolism to secondary bile acids is therefore unaffected by the

hepatic enzyme defects in patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. Patients who receive

treatment with exogenous CA are not expected to differ qualitatively in their bile acid catabolism from

normal subjects as their metabolic defect is in primary bile acid (CA) synthesis.

Reduced clearance of bile acids, including CA and glycocholic acid, in patients with hepatic impairment

of various etiologies has been reported by multiple investigators (de Caestecker *et al.* 1995; Engelking

*et al.* 1979; Gilmore and Thompson, 1980; Luey and Heaton, 1979;

Gilmore and Thompson, 1981). The degree of reduction in clearance appears related to the severity of

the hepatic impairment, i.e. greater reduction in icteric liver disease and less in anicteric disease. The

decrease in clearance results in elevated serum concentrations of bile acids.

The majority of patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that have been treated with CA

presented with some degree of hepatic impairment at the time of diagnosis (CAC-91-10-10; Gonzalez

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 32/97


-----

*et al* . 2009). In most patients, the hepatic impairment improved or resolved with treatment.

Accordingly, the evaluation of the safety of CA includes patients with this metabolic impairment.

No data regarding CA treatment were available in patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism

that have hepatic impairment unrelated to their primary disease (CAC-91-10-10; Gonzalez *et al.*

2009). If such patients are encountered, decreased hepatic clearance of bile acids and/or cholestasis

could occur, leading to increased serum concentrations of CA and symptoms/signs of toxicity. The CA

dose should be reduced which could result in inadequate suppression of the biosynthesis of the

hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acid metabolites and recurrence of the manifestations of the primary

disease. As such, in the absence of clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment from causes

other than the genetic bile acid enzyme deficiencies, no recommendations on dosage adjustment can

be made. It is essential that patients with hepatic impairment unrelated to their primary disease that

are treated with CA be monitored closely.

**Familial hypertriglyceridemia**

Type IV hyperlipoproteinemia, in particular familial hypertriglyceridemia, has been associated with

defective bile acid absorption (Angelin *et al* . 1978). The possibility exists that there may be patients

with both inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis and familial hypertriglyceridaemia (estimated to

occur at the rate of 1 in 5,000,000 to 1 in 7,000,000 live births). Patients with newly diagnosed or a

family history of hypertriglyceridemia are expected to poorly absorb CA in the intestine. The CA dose

for patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia will have to be established and adjusted, but an elevated

dose may be required and safe.
##### ***Pharmacokinetic interaction studies ***

No drug-drug interaction studies with CA and concomitantly administered medications have been

carried out. The relevant drug interactions for CA are expected to be those that are relevant for the

other bile acids, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid.

Drug interactions with CA mainly relate to agents capable of interrupting the enterohepatic circulation

of bile acids, such as the sequestering agents cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalem (Gallaher and

Schneeman, 1986). Administration of CA concomitantly with bile acid sequestrants would be expected

to reduce the efficacy of both. Aluminium-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids *in vitro*

and may be expected to reduce the bioavailability of CA in the same manner as the bile acid

sequestering agents (Mangnall *et al.* 1986). Because of this, if either bile acid sequestrants or

aluminium containing antacids and CA are required to be taken concomitantly, it is recommended that

the substance must be taken at least 5 hours before or after CA in order to minimise the interaction.

In humans, phenobarbital has been shown to increase the pool size and turnover of CA (Miller and

Nestel, 1973). Thus, phenobarbital antagonises the effect of CA and may endanger the established

metabolic control *.*

Ciclosporin alters the pharmacokinetics of CA by inhibition of the hepatic uptake and hepatobiliary

secretion of bile acids (Azer and Stacey, 1994), and also alters its pharmacodynamics by inhibiting

cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. As decreased uptake of CA into hepatocytes will decrease its efficacy,

concomitant administration with ciclosporin should be avoided, if possible.

Oestrogens, oral contraceptives, and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering substances) increase

hepatic cholesterol secretion and hence may counteract the effectiveness of CA (Okolicsanyi *et al* .

1986). Any medicinal products implicated in drug-induced cholestasis through inhibition of transporters

could reduce the effectiveness of CA treatment on co-administration.

##### **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics ** ***Mechanism of action ***

No pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted with CA by the applicant. Treatment with

exogenous CA is intended to replace this physiological bile acid in cases of inborn errors of bile acid

synthesis. Cholic acid and CDCA are the primary bile acids in man on which essential physiological

functions depend. The purpose of substituting missing CA is to restore the main functions of this bile

acid consisting of lipid transport in the form of mixed micelles, the activation of co-lipase and fat

digestion and absorption, the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and the induction of bile flow, thus

preventing cholestasis. Primary bile acids down-regulate their own biosynthesis via activation of

farnesoid X receptor, which represses transcription of the CYP7A1 gene encoding cholesterol 7α
hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of bile acid synthesis (Gonzales *et al* . 2009). The rationale for

CA therapy is improvement of bile flow and fat absorption and restoration of a physiologic feedback

inhibition on bile acid synthesis, lowering the production of toxic bile acid precursors. ***Primary pharmacology ***

Bile acids have a multitude of functions as shown in Table 2 below. The individual contribution of

different primary bile acids and their various conjugates have only been partially elucidated. Cholic acid

and its conjugates appear have a major function in most, if not all of the functions (Balistreri, 1991).

**Table 2** **Physiological functions of bile acids**

**A. In the liver**

1. Generate bile flow through upregulation of bile acid transporters
2. Induce biliary lipid secretion
3. Modulate cholesterol homeostasis through regulation of synthesis and catabolism
4. Regulation of lipoprotein production
**B. In bile**

1. Desaturate bile cholesterol – reduce lithogenic potential
2. Transport cholesterol
3. Buffer Ca 2+ ion

**C. In the intestine**

1. Form micelles (fat digestion)
2. Accelerate lipid transport, including fat-soluble vitamin (A, D, E) absorption
3. Modulate motility
4. Modulate GI hormone output
5. Induce ion (and water) secretion

The effects of oral CA administration on the bile acid composition of bile or luminal content have been

studied in healthy volunteers and in patients with gallstones or liver disease, all of whom had overtly

normal bile acid metabolism. The administered dose was 15 mg/kg per day in two of the studies, 4.7
11.6 mg/day in one study, and 750 mg/day in one study, all of which are similar doses. In all studies,

CA administration shifted the relative composition of bile or intestinal luminal content towards CA and

its metabolite deoxycholic acid, while reducing the relative amount of chenodeoxycholic acid (Toouli *et*

*al.* 1975; Einarsson and Grundy, 1980; Ahlberg *et al.* 1981; Woollett *et al.* 2004). Considering the

available data on the regulation of primary bile acid synthesis, it is apparent that the reduction in

CDCA and its metabolites is due to suppression of primary bile acid synthesis by the exogenously

administered CA.

In contrast, exogenous CA treatment of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis did not alter the relative

concentrations of bile acids in serum (Guldutuna *et al.* 1993). However, absolute bile acid

concentrations did increase to more than twice the normal level. This is consistent with the significant

Assessment report

-----

increase of primary bile acid pool size after oral administration of CA or CDCA to healthy volunteers

(Woollett *et al.* 2004).

In children affected by primary bile acid synthesis deficiency, the rationale for the therapeutic

approach is that oral administration of CA will inhibit endogenous production of hepatotoxic bile acid

precursors produced as a consequence of the inborn error by down-regulating cholesterol 7ɒ
hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell, 2007). In addition,

CA administration provides a stimulus for bile flow which facilitates the hepatic clearance of toxic bile

acid precursors and other toxic substances, including bilirubin. In addition, CA treatment improves

growth by facilitating intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and fats.
##### ***Secondary pharmacology ***

No human studies have described secondary pharmacological effects of CA treatment. Given that CA is

a naturally occurring molecule whose absence is replaced at physiologic levels in patients with primary

bile acid synthesis deficiencies, no typical secondary pharmacological effects would be expected. In

general, exogenous administration of CA to animals in repeat toxicology studies identified organs of

enterohepatic circulation as the targets for CA toxicity and did not provide any evidence of secondary

pharmacological effects. Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated effects on cardiac function only at

100 to 1000-fold the endogenous CA concentration. Moreover, the use of CA (up to 15 mg/kg body

weight/day) to treat patients with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis has not been associated with any

serious or persisting adverse effects on organ function. The absence of studies investigating secondary

pharmacological effects of CA is therefore considered acceptable. **2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology **

The pharmacological data have been mainly compiled from published literature. During the procedure

the applicant provided upon request of the CHMP a more in depth literature review for the

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics allowing a greater characterisation of CA than initially

provided. Cholic acid is an endogenous product and has been used in humans over a considerable

number of years. Since 1992 CA has been administered to infants with inborn errors of bile acid

synthesis and been shown to be an effective treatment. The extensive literature review of the

pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CA was considered appropriate and acceptable to support

the pharmacological aspect of Kolbam.

Cholic acid has been studied in the literature in terms of its kinetics and dynamics, and to a lesser

degree as an exogenous pharmacological agent. In this regard a pharmacokinetic study could have

been useful. Since the pharmacological effects of bile acids such as CA are mainly limited to the

enterohepatic circulation rather than plasma, serial sampling of the bile pool would give the most

meaningful pharmacokinetic data. However, the procedure is highly invasive and not ethical to perform

on a serial basis. For this reason pharmacokinetic studies such as these have not been performed for

treatment with oral CA capsules. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Kolbam, including its

metabolism, are different from that of a conventional synthetic small molecule pharmaceutical in that

once administered, any exogenously administered CA will behave like an endogenous molecule in all

respects. Therefore data on the kinetics and dynamics of endogenous CA provided relevant information

on the clinical pharmacology of Kolbam.

Distribution and pharmacological effects of bile acids such as CA are mainly limited to the

enterohepatic circulation, which includes the intestine, portal vein, liver and biliary tract. Orally

administered CA is well absorbed by passive diffusion along the length of the gastrointestinal tract.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 35/97


-----

Once absorbed, exogenous CA will enter into the body’s bile acid pool and is likely to undergo multiple

cycles of enterohepatic circulation. Cholic acid will pass to the liver in the portal blood, in which it is

moderately bound to albumin. In the liver, CA is efficiently extracted from portal blood by multiple

mechanisms, including passive diffusion and transporters. Within the liver, CA is amidated in species
specific proportions, with glycine and/or taurine, into a more hydrophilic, conjugated form. Conjugated

CA is secreted into bile and will pass in due course into the small intestine where, in association with

other components of bile, it will perform its principal digestive function. Conjugated CA is efficiently

absorbed in the ileum via transporters, passed back to the liver and enters another cycle of

enterohepatic circulation. Any conjugated CA not absorbed in the ileum will pass into the lower

intestine where it may be subject to bacterial metabolism, principally deconjugation and 7
dehydroxylation. Deconjugated CA and deoxycholic acid, the product of 7-dehydroxylation, are

passively absorbed in the lower intestine and carried back to the liver in portal blood, where

reconjugation and, in some species, 7-hydroxylation will take place. In this manner the vast majority

of the bile acid pool is conserved and will cycle multiple times during feeding. Any CA not absorbed will

be excreted in the faeces, either unchanged or following dehydroxylation via bacterial metabolism.

The preparations of CA have changed over the 18 years of the trial period. Originally batches were

extemporaneously manufactured without excipients as capsules containing only the active ingredient.

From approximately 1997 the formulation changed until patients were gradually transitioned to the to
be-marketed formulation beginning 2010. In order to show similarity between the formulations used in

the past in the pivotal trial and the formulation that is intended for marketing the applicant conducted

a bioavailability Study CAC-003-001. This was a single-centre Phase I study of multiple oral doses to

compare the bioavailability of a 250 mg oral capsule (Pharmacy capsule formulation used in the pivotal

clinical study CAC-91-10-10 to a 250 mg capsule (intended commercial formulation of Kolbam) and to

an oral solution or suspension (250 mg). The two oral capsule formulations had similar PK profiles

however the strict criteria for bioequivalence were not met. In addition, despite having similar PK

profiles, neither of the capsule formulations met the criteria for bioequivalence to the oral solution. The

recommended initial dosage for CA in treatment of patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism

is a range from 10-15 mg/kg/day. Thereafter, patients are appropriately managed by titration of the

dose over time to achieve an optimal clinical response. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the

observed differences in the PK parameters of the two formulations are not of clinical significance in

terms of safety or efficacy. The applicant has provided acceptable explanation which shows similarity

between the formulation used in the past in the pivotal trial and the formulation that is intended for

marketing.

CA is the predominant primary bile acid in man. In patients with inborn errors of primary bile acid

synthesis, the biosynthesis of primary bile acids is reduced or absent. In the absence of treatment,

unphysiologic cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile acid metabolites are predominant in the liver, serum and

urine. The rational basis for treatment consists of restoration of the bile acid-dependent component of

bile flow enabling restoration of biliary secretion and biliary elimination of toxic metabolites; inhibition

of the production of the toxic bile acid metabolites by negative feedback on cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase,

which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis; and improvement of the patient’s nutritional

status by correcting intestinal malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.

No data are available for patients with renal impairment. Bile acids including CA are excreted in the

urine in negligible amounts and compromised renal function would not be expected to result in

systemic accumulation and toxicity. For patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that are

successfully treated with CA, development of renal failure may have little or no impact on systemic bile

acid concentrations. However, these patients should be carefully monitored and the dose of CA titrated

individually as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 36/97


-----

The majority of patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that have been treated with CA

presented with some degree of hepatic impairment at the time of diagnosis; in most patients, the

hepatic impairment improved or resolved with treatment. The dose of CA should be adjusted

individually. No experience exists in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than their

primary disease and no dose recommendation can be given. Patients with hepatic impairment should

be monitored closely.

Patients with newly diagnosed or a family history of familial hypertriglyceridaemia are expected to

poorly absorb CA from the intestine. The CA dose for patients with familial hypertriglyceridaemia will

have to be established and adjusted as necessary; an elevated dose may be required in order to

suppress urinary bile acids.

Phenobarbital antagonises the effect of CA. Use of phenobarbital with CA is therefore contraindicated.

Ciclosporin alters the pharmacokinetics of CA by inhibition of the hepatic uptake and hepatobiliary

secretion of bile acids, as well as its pharmacodynamics by inhibition of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase.

Co-administration should be avoided. If administration of ciclosporin is considered necessary, serum

and urine bile acid levels should be closely monitored and the CA dose adjusted accordingly. Drug

interactions with CA mainly relate to medicinal products capable of interrupting the enterohepatic

circulation of bile acids, such as the sequestering agents cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalem.

Aluminium-based antacids have been shown to adsorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to

reduce the levels of CA in the same manner as the bile acid sequestering agents. Should the use of a

preparation containing one of these substances be necessary, it must be taken at least 5 hours before

or after CA. Any medicinal products implicated in drug-induced cholestasis through inhibition of

transporters could reduce the effectiveness of CA treatment on coadministration. In these cases,

serum/bile levels of CA should be closely monitored and the dose adjusted accordingly as reflected in

the product information.
##### **2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology **

Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted were considered satisfactory by the CHMP. ***2.5. Clinical efficacy ***

The clinical programme comprised one main study (Study CAC-91-10-10) supported by a second study

(Study CAC-001-01) which was a subset of the main study. In addition, the findings of these studies

were supplemented by study CAC-002-001 (continuation study of studies CAC-91-10-10 or CAC-001
01) and clinical studies reported in the literature. **2.5.1. Dose response study **

No formal dose ranging studies have been conducted. The dose of CA administered to patients with

genetic defects in bile acid synthesis was based upon the need to adequately down-regulate

endogenous bile acid synthesis that otherwise will continue to lead to the accumulation of atypical bile

acids that are intrinsically hepatotoxic, and to completely replace these atypical bile acids with a

normal primary bile acid pool size. After absorption from the distal intestine, bile acids are returned to

the liver and secreted into bile. This enterohepatic circulation leads to the accumulation of a bile acid

pool that is about 2-4 g in normal adults. Because the pool cycles 10 to 12 times/day, stimulated by

postprandial gallbladder contraction, the effective pool size is much greater (Heubi *et al.* 2007).

Conservation of the bile acid pool occurs by an efficient reabsorption, principally from the small

intestine, and an effective hepatic extraction from the portal venous circulation so that each day less

-----

than 5% is lost in the stool. This bile acid loss is compensated for by hepatic synthesis of newly formed

bile acids. Although the term and pre-term neonate are born with a relatively reduced, size-corrected

bile acid pool, rapid expansion of the pool in the first few months of life ensures adequate intraluminal

concentrations for fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption and promotion of bile flow (Heubi *et al.*

2007). Therefore, in order to substitute a new pool of bile acids in patients that do not synthesise bile,

it is necessary to at least administer an amount equivalent to, or above the daily synthesis rate of the

primary bile acids. As the fractional absorption of CA is not following oral dosing, and as there will be

some conversion by intestinal bacterial metabolism to the secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid

(Hoffman & Cummings, 1982; Lindstedt, 1957; Duane, 1997), the optimal therapeutic target dose of

10-15 mg/kg/day is considered to be required to accomplish the primary goal of down-regulating

endogenous bile acid synthesis, and substituting a normal bile acid pool (Danielsson *et al.* 1963;

Tauber *et al.* 1996; LaRusso *et al.* 1975; Ahlberg *et al.* 1981; Einarsson *et al.* 1974). This has been the

dose range used for approximately 18 years in Study CAC-91- 10-10 conducted at CCHMC.

Additionally, urinary bile acids were monitored by fast atomic bombardment mass spectrometry FAB
MS, and the administered CA dose could be titrated against the extent of disappearance of atypical bile

acid metabolites and the improvement in serum liver function tests, documentation of liver enzymes

(AST, ALT, GGT), and bilirubin levels analysis.

##### ***Treatments ***

In the original study protocol approved on 3 Jan 1992, a combination of ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO)

and CA was stipulated as study medication. Since URSO does not down regulate cholesterol and bile

acid synthesis, it was initially combined with CA, which as a primary bile acid has the required

inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis. However, analysis of urinary bile acids by FAB-MS or gas

chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated incomplete down regulation of endogenous bile

acid synthesis under combined URSO/CA therapy and the investgators suggested that URSO could

possibly interfere with intestinal absorption of CA. After administration of CA alone, a greater down
regulation of bile acid synthesis was obtained as evidenced from a strong decrease or almost complete

disappearance of bile acid precursors (Jacquemin *et al* . 2001). Similarly, in a report on 15 children with

genetic defects in primary bile acid synthesis (Gonzalez *et al.* 2009), marked reductions in Δ4-3-oxo

bile acids and in total urinary bile acid excretion after CA therapy were described, while optimal

suppression of metabolite synthesis was not achieved with URSO and CA therapy. The authors

concluded that URSO in the long-term treatment of a bile acid synthesis defects was seldom useful.

Hence, monotherapy with CA was considered the most appropriate therapeutic strategy to treat inborn

errors in bile acid synthesis, because it provides a stimulus for bile flow and secretion, it inhibits

endogenous production and accumulation of potentially hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acid

precursors, and it facilitates fat absorption without persisting disadvantageous or toxic side effects at

therapeutic doses. In accordance with this evolving awareness for CA efficacy, URSO was removed as

study medication from 12 June 2001. Cholic acid and URSO at a dose of 15 mg/kg each was to be

administered orally, once a day. Following termination of URSO as study medication, only CA at a dose

of 15 mg/kg was to be administered.

The study drug consisted of 250 mg capsule. A liquid formulation, consisting of 15 mg/mL CA in a

sodium bicarbonate solution, was prepared for those patients who could not be administered capsules.

Different sources for the drug substance were used over the long period of the study. The formulations

used in the trial have changed over time. As of July 2008 the CCMHC prepared the CA capsules as well

as the liquid formulation. Patients were gradually transitioned to the to-be-marketed formulation

beginning 2010. ***Objectives ***

The study objectives were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of CA during provision of

compassionate treatment to patients with identified inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. ***Outcomes/endpoints ***

Safety: All subjects for whom it could be determined that they received at least one dose of CA were

included in the Safety population

mITT: If a subject had both a pre- and a post-treatment assessment for any of the main endpoints

(LFT, FAB-MS, or height/weight), that subject was included in the mITT population.

The mITT set was the main analysis set. If a subject had both a pre- and a post-treatment assessment

for any of the main endpoints (LFT, FAB-MS, or Height/Weight assessment), that subject was included

in the mITT population.

Given the variable distribution of pre- and post-treatment visits, it was decided that one pre- and one

post-treatment visit should be selected and used to assess the impact of CA on the main endpoints.

The primary analysis was the worst pre-treatment to the best post-treatment response, per efficacy

outcome. Sensitivity analyses of the worst pre-treatment to the worst post-treatment and the best

pre-treatment to the best post-treatment were presented.

The level of urinary bile excretion was scored using the scale of: 0, normal; 1, slight; 2, significant; or

3, marked. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test, with modified ridit scoring, was used to test

the impact of treatment with CA.

LFTs (transaminases) were evaluated in terms of elevation above the upper normal limit (ULN: below

ULN; ≥1x - <2x ULN; ≥2x - <3x ULN; and ≥3x ULN. A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test, with

modified ridit scoring, was used to test the impact of treatment with CA on LFTs. Pre-treatment vs.

post-treatment height and weight percentiles as well as bilirubin values were compared using a t-test.

Safety parameters were analysed using descriptive statistics.
##### ***Results *** **Participant flow **

Patient disposition is summarized below.

**Table 3** **Patient Disposition**

A total of 16 patients expired according to the final patient disposition information, however, based on

available safety information a total of 21 patients died during the study period. A total of 13 patients

were lost to follow-up, and there were 4 patients where data retrieval was unsuccessful. The remaining

patients continued to receive study medication at the end of the study period. **Recruitment **

The study was conducted in one single site at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center from 3

January 1992 to 31 December 2009. **Conduct of the study **

Studies CAC-91-10-10 and CAC-92-8-19 were initially initiated in 1992 as academic trials and were not

intended to be used for a MAA. The studies started before ICH GCP was published. In consequence, the

full requirements of GCP with regard to study conduct and documentation were often not met. For

example, while the original protocols were reviewed and approved by the IRB, amendments to the

studies were mainly only reported to the IRB via letters or changes to the informed consent

documentation (ICD). No formal protocol amendment was provided until June 2010, after the data cut
off point for the final CAC-91-10-10 CSR. This casted doubt on the reliability of the data presented and

triggered a GCP inspection by the CHMP. The potential to retrospectively implement any corrective and

preventative actions remained limited, however, every effort was made by the applicant to address

and rectify as far as possible any finding and deficiencies identified by the inspection. An extensive re
monitoring was undertaken at the study site from November 2012 to January 2013, to ensure that a

revised CSR contains an accurate and complete picture of all data. The comprehensive re-review

included patient charts, analytical screening logs, adverse events, laboratory findings, study

medication/treatment, and urine FAB-MS data (see GCP section).

In the original protocols (CAC-91-10-10 and the sub-study CAC-92-8-19) specified URSO in

combination with CA as study medication. In June 2001, the use of URSO as study medication was

stopped. Study CAC-91-10-10 started with three visits to CCHMC, one baseline visit, one visit after

1 month on treatment and a third visit after 6 months on treatment. In June 2004, the number of

visits to CCHMC was reduced to two and the on-treatment visit was scheduled at 3-6 months after

treatment start. The original CAC-92-8-19 protocol defined two visits to CCHMC, however, there were

also some scheduled assessments after 6 months on treatment. In general, the number of pre-and

post-treatment visits available per patient is highly variable and often did not follow the protocol

outline. This non-compliance with the protocol was more prevalent once the study was extended to

patients outside of CCHMC. For these patients no CCHMC visits were required, however, monthly on
treatment urine and serum monitoring was requested per protocol for the first 3 months and every 6

months afterwards.

Urine FAB-MS analysis was to be confirmed by serum FAB-MS analysis if urine FAB-MS results were

inconclusive. However, with increasing study duration, it became apparent that urine FAB-MS analysis

was very accurate and as a consequence, serum FAB-MS analysis was often omitted. Since CA exerts

its activity in bile and not serum, therapeutic monitoring of serum is also secondary and not

physiologically relevant. Similarly, the highly invasive procedure to determine the bile acid pool was

often not performed, when it was recognized that due to the advances in the development of analytical

procedures permitting non-invasive sample collection (i.e. FAB-MS analysis of urine), it was no longer

ethical to perform bile acid pool assessments.

Laboratory tests were to include bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, albumin,

prothrombin time, MEG-X. In addition, determination of partial thromboplastin time, prealbumin and

transferrin was to be performed. However, only transaminases (ALT/AST) and bilirubin values were

collected in the study database and are presented in this report. Bilirubin was mostly used as a

diagnostic factor as elevations in direct or conjugated bilirubin are noted in patients with cholestasis.

However, bilirubin monitoring was not used as standard of care in patients with inborn errors of bile

acid synthesis, since it may not necessarily improve with treatment.

A full nutritional evaluation was to be performed for patients included in studies CAC-91-10-10 and

CAC-92-8-19 and a neurologic examination/history assessment was to be done in CAC-92-8-19

patients. However, these assessments were performed infrequently.

*Urinary Bile acids by FAB-MS*

A comparison of worst pre-treatment urine bile acid scores with best post-treatment scores after the

initiation of CA treatment shows a highly statistically significant decrease in atypical bile

acids (p<0.0001) for both the ITT and mITT sets, evidenced by an increase in the number of patients

with lower degrees of atypical bile acids or a normal FAB-MS spectrum. Thus, while 50% of the

patients presented with marked elevation of atypical bile acids at pre-treatment, only about 10% of

patients showed marked increases following treatment with CA. The opposite was true for the number

of patients with FAB-MS spectra equal to those of normal, healthy subjects; the incidence of normal

spectra increased from less than 15% to 60%-70%.

P-value is from a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square test with modified ridit scoring
CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, N = number of patients, n = number of patients in the specified category, TMT = treatment.

The comparison of worst pre-treatment and worst post-treatment values also showed a trend towards

lower LFT scores, however, statistical significance was not reached in either the ITT or mITT analyses.

The impact of CA treatment on ALT and AST analyzed by type of defect is presented based on the

worst pre-treatment to best post-treatment analysis in Table 20 and based on the best pre-treatment

to best post-treatment analysis in Table 15.

*Liver Histology*

Pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies were analyzed qualitatively for the presence of inflammation,

fibrosis, necrosis, giant cells and cholestasis, and quantitatively for the degrees of the aforementioned

histologic features. In a third step, any liver biopsy results were compared to those of the previous

biopsy and the degree of change (improved or worse) was assessed. The results of the qualitative

histopathology assessment are summarized in Table 25.

##### ***Treatments ***

The treatment consisted of a cross-over from the Currently (previously) Used (CU) cholic acid capsules

prepared by the CCHMC Investigational Pharmacy to those manufactured by the proposed commercial

contract manufacturer, i.e., the To Be Marketed (TBM) capsules. ***Objectives ***

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of TBM cholic acid capsules

compared with the effect of the CU formulation of CA prepared in the CCHMC Pharmacy. Therapeutic

efficacy was evaluated by assessing the effects of the administration of TBM cholic acid capsules on (1)

serum transaminases and (2) suppression of synthesis of atypical bile acids as measured by urine and

serum bile acid analysis using mass spectrometry. These findings were compared with the effects of

the currently used formulation of CA.

The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of TBM cholic acid

capsules. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring vital signs, physical examination

findings, clinical laboratory results, and from the incidence and severity of adverse events which were

compared with baseline data. ***Outcomes/endpoints ***

Efficacy and safety measurements consisted of the effect of CU cholic acid capsules (baseline visit)

compared with the effect of the TBM formulation of CA (Visit 2 after 30 days of study drug

administration) on:

1. Serum transaminases

2. regulation of synthesis of atypical bile acids in blood and urine as determined by mass

spectrometry (FAB-MS, and LC-MS/MS)

3. The safety and tolerability of TBM cholic acid capsules were assessed by the incidence and severity

of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) ***Sample size ***

No sample size calculations were done; the planned sample size (n=25) ***Randomisation ***

Since the study treatment consisted of a cross-over from the CU cholic acid capsules to the TBM

capsules, all patients enrolled in the study comprised a single treatment group.

##### ***Blinding (masking) ***

The study was open-label; no blinding was involved. ***Statistical methods ***

Efficacy:

1. Descriptive statistics for the treatment periods (e.g., liver function tests, urine FAB-MS, GCMS,

serum LC-MS) were presented for all baseline data (Visit 1; CU formulation) and compared with

results from the final visit (Visit 2; TBM formulation).

2. The primary parameters (maintenance of baseline ALT/AST values and regulation of atypical

metabolites) were compared between the treatment groups.

Safety:

The incidence and severity of adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and physical

examination findings are presented. ***Results *** **Participant flow **

All 16 patients enrolled have completed each phase of the study, no patients were discontinued or

withdrew, and all enrolled patients were included in both the efficacy and safety analyses. **Recruitment **

The study was conducted at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center from 28 April to 23

August 2010 **Conduct of the study **

The original planned enrolment for the study was 25 patients. However, as above, only 16 subjects

would agree to participate in the study and travel to the study site. **Baseline data **

Study demographics included an age range of from 0.6 – 20 years of age; 11 males and 5 females;

and an ethnicity breakdown of 9 white/non-Hispanic, 5 white/Hispanic, 2 black/non-Hispanic; and

included a diagnosis breakdown of 11 3ß-HSD, 3 CTX and 2 5ß-reductase defects. **Numbers analysed **

All 16 patients enrolled were analysed. **Outcomes and estimation **

Therapeutic equivalence was assessed at the end of 30 days of treatment using a T-test comparison

for the baseline and 30 day results (e.g. liver function tests, urine and serum bile acids by FAB-MS,

GC-MS, LC-MS/MS) and safety was assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events, clinical

laboratory test results, vital signs, and physical examination. There were no clinically significant

changes in laboratory values, in physical exam, vital signs at the follow-up visit, except for one subject

who had increases in AST and ALT. Although, due to the extreme rarity of these bile metabolism

defects, it is not possible to conduct such a study with a large sample of patients, the applicant judged

that the results were adequate to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of TBM cholic acid capsules

compared with that of the CU formulation of cholic acid capsules as therapeutic equivalence was

observed in 15 out of 16 subjects (93.75%, 95% confidence interval: 69.8%, 99.8%).
##### **Study CAC-002-001 **

Title of Study CAC-002-001: An open-label, single-centre, nonrandomized continuation study of CA

capsules in subjects with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis. ***Methods ***

This was a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, non-randomized, non-comparative study investigating CA

in the treatment of subjects with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. The study was a continuation

study that included eligible subjects who had previously received CA in studies CAC-91-10-10 or CAC
001-01 and newly diagnosed subjects.

Prior to enrolment, new subjects were diagnosed at CCHMC for inborn errors of bile acid synthesis

using urine FAB-MS analysis. Upon enrolment, the subject underwent baseline assessments including

standard of care assessments and LFTs. Further safety and efficacy assessments were collected every

6-12 months or when clinically indicated. For subjects continuing treatment from previous studies,

laboratory assessments and urine bile acid analysis was performed every 6-12 months or when

clinically feasible. Standard of care physical examinations could also be performed.

The objective was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of CA in subjects with identified

inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. The study was conducted at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital

Medical Center. The observation period for this interim report submitted during the procedure was 33

months from 1 January 2010 to 30 September 2012.

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all enrolled subjects. A subject was considered enrolled

if he or his caregiver had provided consent and had undergone at least one round of study evaluations.

The safety population was comprised of all subjects for whom it could be determined that they

received at least one dose of CA. The efficacy evaluable population (EEP) comprised all subjects who,

for any efficacy end-point, had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. For each

individual efficacy analysis, only patients who had both a baseline and post baseline assessments

contributed to that analysis. The ITT set was the main analysis set for efficacy analyses. The safety set

was the main analysis set for safety analyses. Since patients did not follow a fixed visit schedule,

analyses of changes from baseline to a given time point were not feasible. The primary efficacy

analyses were the baseline to the worst post-baseline response, per efficacy outcome. ***Results ***

A total of 41 patients took part in the continuation study. Of these 31 (76%) were on CA medication at

study start, i.e. transitioned from study CAC-91-10-10. Another 10 patients (24%) were treatment

naive, i.e. received their first dose of CA during study CAC-002-01. A total of 33 patients (80%) had at

least one baseline and one post-baseline assessment for an efficacy endpoint and were included in the

EEP set. The majority of patients received CA treatment from both the CCHMC and the commercial

formulation.

Because of its nature as a long-term, ongoing study, with some and non-rigorous determination of

study visits and assessments, protocol violations were not used to determine the exclusion of patients

from the analysis sets, but instead the availability of pre- and post-baseline assessments was used.

Overall, the majority of patients with single enzyme defects presented with 3β-HSD deficiency (21),

followed by ∆ [4] -3-oxo-R (4) and CTX deficiency (4). Twelve patients had peroxisomal disorders.

*Urine bile acids*

A comparison of baseline urinary bile acid scores with worst post-baseline scores for the overall

population that includes both patients on CA at study start and treatment naive patients showed no

statistically significant changes. In the baseline to best post-baseline value analysis bile acid scores

showed an increase in the percentage of patients with normal bile acid spectra and decreases in the

percentages of patients with marked or significant elevations in atypical bile acids. The changes were

not statistically significant in the ITT analysis, but reached statistical significance in the EE population.

*Transaminases*

No statistically significant changes were seen in the baseline to worst post-baseline analysis. In the

baseline to best post-baseline value analysis the number of patients with ALT values <ULN increased,

while the number of patients with values ≥2x ULN decreased, in both analysis sets. However, the

changes were not statistically significant. In the baseline to worst post-baseline analysis, the number

of patients ALT values <ULN decreased slightly, while the number of patients with ALT values ≥1x but

<2 ULN increased. The changes were also not statistically significant. AST values improved with

statistical significance from baseline to the best post-baseline assessment (p <0.05).

*Bilirubin*

Mean total bilirubin values remained stable (mean change 0.1 mg/dL; range of changes -1.9 to

1.6 mg/dL) in the baseline to worst post-baseline value analysis and decreased by about 0.8 mg/dL

(range -12.0 to 1.6 mg/dL) in the baseline to best post-baseline value analysis.

*Height and weight percentiles*

Both height and weight percentiles decreased slightly in the baseline to worst post-baseline value

analysis and increased slightly in the baseline to best post-baseline value analysis. None of the

changes were statistically significant.

*Subgroup analyses*

Treatment naive patients generally showed improvements in all efficacy parameters analysed.

However, statistical significance could not be shown, most likely owing to the small number of

treatment naive subjects (10 in the ITT set and 5 in the EEP set). Of note, total bilirubin values and

height percentiles improved even in the baseline to worst post-baseline value analysis. Patients who

had received CA treatment in the previous study showed continuous therapeutic efficacy and presented

with significant improvements in some efficacy parameters, potentially indicating increasing efficacy

during long-term treatment. The subgroup of patients receiving the commercial formulation tended to

show larger improvements in the baseline to best post-baseline value analysis than patients receiving

the CCHMC formulation, while no relevant differences were seen in the baseline to worst analysis.

Patients with single enzyme defects responded better to treatment with CA than patients with

peroxisomal disorders, as indicated by larger improvements in the baseline to best post-baseline value

analyses.

##### **Literature reports **

A clinical study reported in the literature (Gonzales *et al.* 2009) enrolled 15 patients (eight of whom

had been included in the patients diagnosed under the CCHMC and then transferred) followed up for at

least 5 years at Hospital Bicetre, France. Thirteen of these patients were diagnosed with HSD3ß7 and 2

with Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency by mass spectrometry and gene sequencing. All patients

were treated with CA with the median duration of treatment 12.4 years (range 5.6 – 15 years),

however some very early patients were treated with oral ursodeoxycholic acid as well. Therapy started

at a median age of 3.9 years (range 0.3 – 13.1 years). The mean dose at the start of treatment was

13 mg/kg and the mean dose at last follow up was 6 mg/kg. During treatment clinical and laboratory

findings gradually normalised, and atypical bile acid metabolites in the urine were reduced 500 fold in

the HSD3ß7 patients and 30 fold in the Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency patients. Liver

biopsies were performed in 14 patients after at least 5 years treatment and all showed marked

improvement, particularly those with HSD3ß7. The authors stated that CA was well tolerated in all

patients.

A published clinical investigation on the use of CA in the treatment of bile acid metabolic disorders was

performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Bicêtre, France (Potin *et al.* 2001). Ten children

diagnosed with HSD3ß7 and two children with Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency were included

in a clinical trial to assess the effect of treatment with CA and with a combination of CA and

ursodeoxycholic acid. Clinical and biological parameters such as weight, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly,

biochemical parameters, and haematology were recorded at inclusion and thereafter every 6 months.

Until the nature of the enzyme deficiency was diagnosed, monotherapy with ursodeoxycholic acid was

started to treat cholestasis. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, the children received a regimen of

either, ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy (18-30 mg/kg/day), or CA and ursodeoxycholic acid in

combination (each 5-15 mg/kg/day), or CA monotherapy (5–15 mg/kg/day) depending on the clinical

presentation. The children with HSD3ß7 deficiency had normalised liver enzymes after treatment with

ursodeoxycholic acid followed by CA or CA and ursodeoxycholic acid combination. By contrast, in the

children with Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency, liver disease remained either unchanged or was

aggravated during ursodeoxycholic acid monotherapy. Under CA and ursodeoxycholic acid combination

therapy, the liver enzymes became normal within 10 months and remained stable during the following

CA monotherapy for a mean period of 4.2 years. Cholic acid treatment was well tolerated in 11 of

these 12 children. Only one patient developed pruritus under therapy, which completely disappeared

after dose reduction from 15 mg/kg/day down to 5 mg/kg/day.

A paper by Pierre *et al.* 2008 describes the use of CA to treat two patients with Cerebrotendinous

Xanthomatosis (CTX). These patients were siblings who were born of Asian parents. The eldest was

male and was transferred to a specialist liver unit at 3 months of age with jaundice and hepatitis. The

child was initially treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and the jaundice resolved by 5 months of age. CTX

was diagnosed before 1 year of age as a result of abnormal bile alcohol glucuronides and reduced

primary bile acids in the urine. Treatment was changed to CA 15 mg/kg daily at age 14 months, which

resulted in a good biochemical response and a marked reduction in bile alcohol excretion. The patient

remained clinically normal at 8 years of age. The younger sibling was a female and was diagnosed with

CTX at a young age, and commenced treatment with CA at age 5 months. She never developed

jaundice or abnormal liver function and remains free of liver symptoms at 7 years of age, though there

was some evidence that neurodevelopment may have been slightly below average.

Daugherty *et al.* 1993 described the use of CA to treat three male patients with Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5ß
reductase deficiency. Two of these patients were identical twins, and all were jaundiced at birth. The

twins started treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid on Day 29 after birth, and were switched 4 days

later to CDCA and CA therapy. The third child commenced treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid and CA

from the first week. There was a positive response to ursodeoxycholic acid/chenodeoxycholic

acid/cholic acid therapy as well as the improvement in histology at both the light and electron

microscope level in these patients.
##### **2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy ** **Design and conduct of clinical studies **

***Study 91-10-10***

Study 91-10-10 was an open-label, single arm, non-comparative, compassionate treatment study of

CA in the treatment of inborn errors of bile acid metabolism. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that a

controlled clinical study was not feasible in the condition at stake. Inborn errors in primary bile acid

synthesis remain a condition that is debilitating in the long term and life threatening. It would be

therefore contrary to principles of medical ethics to collect evidence of clinical efficacy of CA in a

controlled clinical study. A controlled study implies withholding the sole existing treatment, CA, at least

for a limited period of time. A number of studies have shown that an interruption of bile acid treatment

of patients may lead to a rapid deterioration of liver function tests and increases in the production of

hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acids (Vanderpas *et al* . 1987; Koopman *et al* . 1988; Kobayashi *et al* .

2000; Yamato *et al* . 2001). Therefore, participation in a controlled clinical trial would expose patients

to a risk of severe hepatic damage or even death.

Studies CAC-91-10-10 (and its substudy CAC-92-8-19) were initiated in 1992 as academic trials. The

studies had started before ICH GCP was published. Therefore, the full requirements of GCP with regard

to study conduct and documentation were often not met. This casted doubt on the reliability of the

data presented and triggered a GCP inspection by the CHMP. The potential to retrospectively

implement any corrective and preventative actions remained limited, however, every effort was made

by the applicant to address and rectify as far as possible any finding and deficiencies identified by the

inspection. During the procedure the applicant addressed the inspection findings and provided a

revised CSR for which an extensive re-monitoring of the study data was performed resulting in an

increased reliability of the data integrity. The comprehensive re-review included patient charts,

analytical screening logs, adverse events, laboratory findings, study medication/treatment, and urine

FAB-MS data. As a result of the re-monitoring, more patients could be included in the analysis. In

addition, sensitivity analyses comprising additional data analysis sets and subpopulation analyses were

performed to further investigate the robustness of the results. The results of the revised CSR are

presented in this report. Despite a non-optimal documentation of study data due to the early stage

academic nature of the study and the long-term study period, the results presented consistently

showed improvements in the efficacy parameters analyzed and across the majority of subpopulations

and analysis sets. Even given the sparseness of data documentation, GCP lapses and remaining

uncertainties in data integration, the CHMP considered that observed consistency of the results and the

maintenance of improvement in patients’ symptoms provides evidence in support of the therapeutic

efficacy of CA in the treatment of CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.

Eighty-five (85) patients were diagnosed and enrolled from January 1992 to December 2009; 52

patients in study CAC-91-10-10 having single enzymatic defects (3β-HSD, Δ [4] -3-oxoR, CTX, AMACR and

CYP7A1 deficiencies) and 31 patients in study CAC-92-8-19 having peroxisomal disorders. Of the 52

patients, 6 died, 3 had no evidence of treatment, 4 terminated the study, 10 were lost to follow-up,

and for 1 data retrieval was unsuccessful. Of the 85 patients, 79 have received study medication

treatment, 49 in study CAC-91-10-10 (patients suffering from 3β-HSD, Δ [4] -3-oxoR, CTX, AMACR and

CYP7A1 deficiencies) and 29 in study CAC-92-8-19. In this set of patients (49), about one quarter was

below or at most 6 months of age at diagnosis, and about one third were between 7 and 36 months.

On average, patients in this subgroup were 3 years at treatment start, minimum and maximum ages

were 0 and 14 years, respectively. Of the patients who received treatment at least once, four

discontinued the study because of liver transplantation and one due to worsening cholestasis. Only

patients who received treatment and had at least one pre- and one post-treatment assessment for

urine bile acids, LFTs, height and weight were included in the mITT set. This prerequisite was fulfilled

for a total of 70 patients (82%), 42 patients from study 91-10-10 and 27 patients from study 92-8-19.

While the patient population is the result of screening several thousands of patients with ‘idiopathic

liver disease’ it may not be entirely representative of the true patient population in the European Union

due the strong representation of a single centre, the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Centre.

However, data from the publication of study reports from European centres such as the Centre

Hospitalier Universitaire Bicêtre, France gave European representation to the patient population. Within

the limitations of a small sample size, the diversity of the population described combined with the wide

spectrum of disease severity reflects the complete scientific knowledge on the patient population.

Thus, the reported patient population can be considered to be reasonably representative of the entire

patient population in the EU.

The demographic characteristics were comparable for the ITT, safety and mITT sets. Most patients in

each set were White (≥35%), followed by Hispanic patients (≥12%). For 23% to 34% of patients the

race was unknown. About 60% of patients included in each set were male, compared to about 36% of

female patients. Patients were on average 2 years of age at diagnosis and started treatment at 3 years

of age. However, the range of age at diagnosis varied from 0 to 13 years and for age at treatment

start from 0 to 16 years. About half the patients (49%) were below 6 months of age at diagnosis. On

average, the patients were in the 33% to 34% height percentile, i.e. about 33% to 34% of children are

shorter at a comparable age. The mean weight percentile was 35% to 39%.

Overall, about two-thirds of the patients included presented with a single enzyme defect, while about

one-third presented with a peroxisomal disorder. The majority of patients with single enzyme defects

presented with *3* β *-HSD* deficiency, followed by ∆ [4] -3-oxo-R and CTX deficiency.

The treatment consisted of CA capsules, each containing 250 mg of CA, or a liquid preparation of

15 mg/mL CA, administered orally in a dose of about 15 mg/kg body weight/day. This dose has been

used empirically based on metabolic response in terms of liver functions and urinary bile acids. The

therapeutic target dose of 10-15 mg/kg/day was considered to be required to accomplish the goal of

down-regulating endogenous bile acid synthesis, and substituting a normal bile acid pool. Thereafter

the dose is adapted based on titration to the effect (metabolic response) observed in the individual

patient. During the procedure the applicant further clarified that, in order to substitute a pool of bile

acids in patients with defects in bile acid synthesis it is necessary to at least administer an amount

equivalent to, or above the daily synthesis rate of the primary bile acids. As the fractional absorption of

bile acids is not 100% and, as there is some conversion by intestinal bacteria to the secondary bile

acid deoxycholic acid, a therapeutic dose of 15 mg/kg/day was chosen to enable substitution of a

normal bile acid pool. In addition, dosing information for long-time surviving patients with 3ß-HSD

deficiency was reported by Gonzalez *et al* . 2009. When CA treatment was established as monotherapy,

the average weight-based daily doses were 12.9 mg/kg (range: 2.3-18.9 mg/kg) at the initiation of

treatment and 5.5 mg/kg (range: 2.5-9.8 mg/kg) after long-term maintenance, with the patients

increasing in age and weight over the time of treatment. The authors noted that at the beginning of

treatment, the dose of cholic acid had to be increased from one to several times in 8 of the 13 patients

in order to achieve optimal response to treatment (based on concentrations of atypical metabolites in

urine). Conversely, the daily dose of CA was decreased in 4 patients because of signs of overdose. In

this study, data on the starting doses in Δ4-3-oxoR deficiency were similar, with the caveat that most

of these patients were additionally receiving URSO or chenodeoxycholic acid. Younger and lighter

patients appeared to require and tolerate higher doses per body weight than older children, which is in

agreement with observations by Heubi *et al.* 1982 that infants and children have about 40% larger

cholic acid pool sizes than adults on a per m [2] basis, and the CA turnover rate decreases by about 40%

between infants and children, and between children and adults. Overall, the initial dose proposed for

CA, 10 to 15 mg/kg per day, is considered consistent with the estimates of the amount required for

bile pool replenishment and maintenance, and with the clinical experience in treatment of patients.

It is important to emphasize that the recommended dose range is for initial dosing only. While this

initial dose range has proven to be appropriate for nearly all patients, the practice has always been to

titrate patients to obtain the desired biologic effect in terms of suppression of abnormal bile acid

synthesis and normalization of serum transaminases and, in addition, to monitor for possible

overdosage indicated by clinical symptoms and increases in GGT and/or transaminases. Regarding

dose recommendations based on the two CA capsule strengths, where the dose is not a multiple of 50,

the nearest dose below the maximum of 15 mg/kg/day should be selected using a combination of the

two capsule strengths, provided that it is sufficient to suppress urinary bile acids. If not, titration of the

dose should commence using the next higher dose. Appropriate guidance for dose titration is provided

in the SmPC.

***Study CAC-001-01***

The study was an open-label, non-randomised, single centre, cohort comparative study of two CA oral

capsule formulations using each patient as his/her own control. Sixteen patients were enrolled and

completed. Patients with inborn errors of bile acid synthesis who were being treated with CA capsules

prepared by the CCHMC Pharmacy were switched from Study CAC-91-10-10 to the to be marketed

commercial formulation CA capsules, each containing 50 or 250 mg of CA to be taken orally in a dose

of 10-15 mg/kg body weight/day. Therapeutic equivalence was assessed at the end of 30 days of

treatment using a T-test comparison for the baseline and 30 day results (e.g. liver function tests, urine

and serum bile acids by FAB-MS, GC-MS, LC-MS/MS).
##### **Efficacy data and additional analyses **

***Study 91-10-10***

The mITT set (70 patients) was the main analysis set; of which 42 patients (60%) had one of the

claimed single enzyme defects. If a subject had both a pre- and a post-treatment assessment for any

of the main endpoints (LFT, FAB-MS, or height/weight assessment), that subject was included in the

mITT population. Changes in urinary bile acids and in LFTs (AST/ALT) were analysed as main efficacy

parameters. The applicant presented analysis by primary diagnosis for urinary bile acids, LFTs and

height and weight analyses. A global analysis combining the single enzyme defects and the

peroxisomal disorders patients was presented for all parameters studied; however analyses by primary

diagnosis are the only relevant data in support of the claimed indications as peroxisomal disorder is a

different condition to inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis.

*Urinary Bile acids by FAB-MS*

A global analysis (combining single enzyme defects and peroxisomal disorders) of worst pre-treatment

urine bile acid scores with best post-treatment scores after the initiation of CA treatment showed a

statistically significant decrease in atypical bile acids (p <0.0001, mITT). A statistically significant

improvement in urinary bile acid scores was also observed for the best pre-treatment to best post
treatment analysis for both the ITT and mITT sets (p <0.0001). Treatment with CA also statistically

-----

significantly improved urine bile acid scores in patients with single enzyme defects considered as a

group in the worst to best analysis (p <0.0001, mITT). Statistically significant improvements in urine

bile acid scores were also shown in the best to best analysis. In accordance with the improvements

seen in the analysis by type of disorder as groups, general improvements in the degree of atypical

urine bile acids were seen in each individual enzyme defect group. However, the patient numbers per

defect were often too low to enable statistically significant results. Statistically significant

improvements were seen in primary diagnosis groups with at least six patients. When the single

enzyme defect groups with less than six patients were combined, the improvement in urinary bile acids

reached statistical significance also for this group. In the best pre-treatment to best post-treatment

analysis changes in bile acids for patients with defects in the single enzymes *3* β *-HSD* or ∆ *[4]* *-3-oxo-R*

showed statistical significance. Combined selected single enzymes showed a statistically significant

improvement in the mITT analysis. No statistically significant changes were seen in the worst pre
treatment to worst post-treatment analysis.

Although measurements of urine bile acids were highlighted as being unverifiable in the GCP inspection,

there was no specific concern highlighted in the GCP inspection to indicate that these measures were

systematically incorrect and it is reassuring that the changes reported matches clinical expectation and

other literature reports of cholic acid treatment.

Patients with and without concomitant URSO treatment showed statistically significant improvements

in urinary bile acids from pre- to post-treatment, indicating that URSO had no impact on the overall

efficacy of CA treatment (p <0.0001, mITT). Data were presented only for the global analysis

combining single enzyme defects and peroxisomal disorders.

*Liver function tests (serum transaminases)*

In the global analysis, both ALT and AST values improved with statistical significance from the worst

pre-treatment to the best post-treatment assessment (p <0.0001) in the ITT and mITT sets. Especially

the number of patients with ALT and AST values < ULN increased notably, while the number of

patients with values ≥3x ULN decreased. The results were comparable for ALT and AST. A statistically

significant improvement in ALT and AST scores was also shown for the best pre-treatment to best

post-treatment analysis in the ITT and mITT analyses, although more patients presented with values

<ULN and less patients with values ≥3x ULN at pre-treatment, in accordance with the analysis type.

In the worst to best analysis, treatment with CA improved LFT scores in patients with single enzyme

defects as a group, reaching statistical significance for all analyses. There was a strong increase in

ALT/AST values <ULN together with a strong decrease in values ≥3x ULN. Statistically significant

improvements in LFT scores were also shown in the best to best ITT and mITT analyses for patients

with single enzyme defects. Shifts towards improvements in ALT and AST values were shown for each

primary diagnosis category; however, statistical significance was only reached in the *3ß-HSD* . The

result can be explained with the generally low patient numbers per group. When the small groups of

the single enzyme defects are combined, the worst to best analysis also shows a statistically significant

reduction of ALT and a strong trend for AST.

In the global analysis, patients with and without concomitant URSO treatment showed statistically

significant improvements in ALT and AST from pre- to post-treatment (p <0.003, mITT), indicating

that URSO had no impact on the overall efficacy of CA treatment. The improvements were generally

comparable for ALT and AST values. Data were presented only for the global analysis combining single

enzyme defects and peroxisomal disorders.

*Bilirubin*

In the global analysis, mean bilirubin values decreased from pre-treatment to post-treatment

assessments for each bilirubin category analysed. The decrease was statistically significant for direct

Assessment report

-----

bilirubin, the category with most data available and particularly important for the diagnostic picture of

inborn errors of bile acid synthesis, since direct bilirubin is elevated in cholestasis. No analysis by

primary diagnosis was provided.

*Height and weight*

Both height and weight percentiles increased from the worst pre-treatment to the best post-treatment

assessment in the ITT and mITT sets, but statistical significance was only reached for the changes in

weight (global analysis). It has to be noted that the number of patients with data available was about

twice as high for the weight compared to the height analysis. The results were comparable for the ITT

and mITT analyses. No statistically significant changes in height or weight percentiles were shown in

the best pre-treatment to best post-treatment analysis in the ITT and mITT analyses. Best pre
treatment and best post-treatment values were generally comparable. Treatment with CA improved

height and weight percentiles in patients with single enzyme defects, but only the changes in weight

were statistically significant for both the ITT and mITT sets. Shifts towards increases in height and

weight were generally shown for each primary diagnosis category; however, statistical significance was

only reached for the change in weight of patients with defects in *3ß-HSD* .

Both patients with and without concomitant URSO treatment showed statistically significant

improvements in weight percentiles from pre- to post-treatment in the ITT analysis. Statistical

significance was missed in the weight analysis in patients without concomitant URSO treatment in the

mITT analysis. Changes in height percentiles were not statistically significant in either subgroup or

analysis. No analysis by primary diagnosis was provided.

Liver histology

With the exception of bridging fibrosis and unspecified fibrosis, all parameters assessed were less

frequently present in post-treatment biopsies than in pre-treatment biopsies. Particularly the numbers

of patients with cholestasis, giant cells, and necrosis had improved from pre- to post-treatment. For

the majority of parameters, the number of patients with trace or moderate levels of histopathologic

signs decreased from pre- to post-treatment, while the number of patients with absent symptoms

increased. No analysis by primary diagnosis was provided.

The text below discusses in general terms the evidence for efficacy of Kolbam in the treatment of

inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis.

The CHMP considered that the above discussed results demonstrated that treatment with CA acts by

feedback regulation on the liver and down regulation of primary bile acid synthesis, leading to a

reduction and/or disappearance of atypical hepatotoxic bile acids and their intermediates and

normalization of serum liver enzymes levels in the single enzyme defects studied. The absolute number

of patients remains limited due to the rarity of the conditions; moreover, the distributed nature of the

study with many international patients under the direct care of their local physicians led to sporadic

collection of data. The rarity of the condition, as well as ethical considerations, made the conduct of a

controlled clinical study impossible. The uncontrolled data made difficult to ascertain the beneficial

effects of CA. The patient numbers per defect were often too low to enable statistically significant

results. However, treatment with CA statistically significantly improved urine bile acid scores in

patients with single enzyme defects considered as a group; significance was achieved for patients with

defects in the single enzymes *3* β *-HSD* or ∆ *[4]* *-3-oxo-R* in the best pre-treatment to best post-treatment

analysis. Statistically significant improvements in LFT scores were also shown in the best to best ITT

and mITT analyses for patients with single enzyme defects considered as a group. Shifts towards

improvements in ALT and AST values were shown in individual defect groups; however, statistical

significance was only reached in the 3ß-HSD patients.

In an uncontrolled trial, statistical tests of pre-treatment to post-treatment changes to draw inferences

on efficacy are confounded by time and by concomitant therapeutic interventions and patient

management. Hence, a close scrutiny of individual profiles of response and a clear biological and

pharmacological rationale for the intervention, substantiated by basic science and literature data, is the

basis on which to draw conclusions about therapeutic efficacy. The conclusion of therapeutic efficacy is

made considering results across all single enzyme defects included in the trial. This rationale can then

be applied to each single enzyme defect under consideration based on knowledge of disease pathology

and cholic acid pharmacology, in addition to the available clinical trial and literature data. In

particular, it is agreed with the applicant that in each of these enzyme deficiencies, the elevated

transaminases and abnormal liver histology result from the abnormal bile acids that occur as a

consequence of the blockage of the CA biosynthetic pathway by the enzyme defects. For each of these

deficiencies, the therapeutic benefit of CA derives from the same mechanism, namely the ability to

inhibit transcription of the 7-alpha hydroxylase (at the head of the pathway through an FXR-dependent

mechanism) (Setchell and O-Connell, 2007) or provides benefit to patients by providing CA to patients.

Whilst the magnitude of changes in metabolic and pathologic parameters may differ in each different

phenotype (noting also that clinical prognosis differs by phenotype), it is evident that an effective

cholic acid preparation will be therapeutically efficacious in each.

Overall, the clinical data presented in this study support demonstration of efficacy of CA for patients

with single enzyme defects as measured by objective improvement in metabolic and pathologic

parameters over the 17 years period of the study.

***Study CAC-001-01***

The study results showed that there were no clinically significant changes in laboratory values at the

follow-up visit, except for one subject who had increases in AST and ALT. The applicant claimed that

therapeutic equivalence was observed in 15 out of 16 subjects (93.75%, 95% CI 69.8%, 99.8%) with

a return back to baseline LFT for the lone patient not meeting the therapeutic equivalence criteria

immediately post treatment. While there is no evidence to show that the TBM CA formulation is

therapeutically inferior to the CA used in the previous study, the data remains limited. In total 25

patients were planned to be enrolled; however only 16 patients enrolled and one of these patients was

not treatment compliant. The applicant has concluded the 95% therapeutic equivalence CI ranged

69.8% to 99.8% which is limited. The duration of the trial was relatively short and some variability of

the data was noted where AST may improve but ALT worsened. For urinary and serum atypical bile

acid metabolites there was a general trend of improvement however some cases show increases in

urinary atypical bile acid metabolites. Overall due to the lower power, the relatively short duration of

study, the observed variability of data and the overall results of this trial the CHMP could not conclude

that both formulations were therapeutically equivalent. However, as the treatment of patients with

inborn errors of bile acid metabolism is appropriately managed by titration of the dose over time to

achieve an optimal clinical response, the CHMP concluded that the observed differences were not of

clinically significant in terms of efficacy or safety. Patients responded similarly when they switched

treatments and importantly no new safety events arose.

***Study CAC-002-001***

During the procedure the applicant provided as supportive data the 33 months interim report of study

CAC-002-001; the continuation study of 91-10-10 and also including newly diagnosed patients. The

efficacy analysis of urinary bile acids and transaminases using the comparison from baseline to worst

post-baseline value for the overall population that included both patients on CA at study start and

treatment naive patients showed no statistically significant changes. Similar results were shown for the

height and weight analysis. Mean total bilirubin values also remained stable in the baseline to worst

-----

post-baseline value analysis. Since the overall population included a large proportion of patients

already on CA treatment at study start (31 of 41 patients, 76%), the results showed the continuous

efficacy of CA treatment without deterioration of the parameters analysed. Subgroup analyses

stratifying patients by formulation, treatment status, and disorder type generally confirmed the results

obtained for the overall population.

***Literature reports***

Clinical experience has been reported in the literature by the applicant from small cohorts of patients

and single case reports; absolute patient numbers are small (<30) due to the rarity of the conditions.

Reporting and publication bias are potential concerns given the small number of cases reported in the

literature as well as their geographic concentrations. However, given the documented survival benefit

of treatment with CA and bile acid therapy overall, complete treatment failures appear unlikely except

for patients with advanced liver disease. Mixed treatment results may not have been considered for

publication by investigators or scientific journals. Long-term data on treatment with CA monotherapy

are reported in the literature presented for 3ß-HSD, ∆ [4] -3-oxo-R and CTX patients observed for more

than 10 years in the EU. The CHMP considered that the available clinical data presented in this

literature review support the demonstration of efficacy of CA reported in the pivotal study 91-10-10, as

measured by objective improvement in metabolic and pathologic parameters in patients reported. In

the reported patients oral cholic acid therapy has been shown to postpone or obviate the need for liver

transplantation; restore normal laboratory parameters; improve histological lesions of the liver, and

significantly improve all of the patient’s symptoms. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine during cholic

acid therapy shows the presence of cholic acid and a marked reduction and in some cases, complete

elimination of the toxic bile acid metabolites. This reflects the restoration of an effective feedback

mechanism of bile acid synthesis.

***Discussion on the indication statement***

The applicant initially applied for the treatment of nine indications being nine primary enzyme defects

included in the inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis condition. During the procedure the

applicant was requested to restrict the indications to the specific defects that have been actually

studied in the application. The applicant argued that in each of these enzymes deficiencies, the

elevated transaminases and abnormal liver histology result from the abnormal bile acids that occur as

a consequence of the blockage of the CA biosynthetic pathway by the enzyme defects. For each of

these deficiencies, the therapeutic benefit of CA derives from precisely the same mechanism, namely

the ability to inhibit transcription of the 7-alpha hydroxylase (at the head of the pathway through an

FXR-dependent mechanism) (Setchell and O’Connell (2007)) or provides benefit to patients by

providing CA to patients.

The CHMP acknowledged that it may not be possible to investigate the effects of CA in all the inborn

errors of bile acid synthesis. However, specific enzymes deficiencies can only be claimed if they have

been actually studied. The applicant agreed that only the specific enzymes deficiencies that have been

studied in the 91-10-10 study could support the therapeutic indications. The following revised

indication statement was proposed:

*“cholic acid FGK is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis responsive*

*to treatment with cholic acid, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment*

*through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects:*

  - *3ß-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase (also known as 3ß-hydroxy- Δ5-C27-steroid*

*dehydrogenase/isomerase or 3ß-HSD or HSD3ß7) deficiency*

  - *∆4-3-oxosteroid 5ß-reductase (∆4-3-oxo-R or AKR1D1) deficiency*

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 69/97


-----

  - *Sterol 27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX) deficiency*

  - *2- (or α-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency*

  - *Cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency”*

Furthermore, the CHMP concluded that each of the claimed indications covering a specific enzyme

deficiency is a clinical distinct medical entity.

On 13 September 2013 the Commission granted a marketing authorisation for the orphan medicinal

product Orphacol. In accordance with Articles 8(1) and 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, the

applicant submitted a report on similarity of Kolbam to Orphacol and a report claiming the derogation

of Orphacol’s market exclusivity based on clinical superiority to Orphacol. The CHMP considered that

Kolbam was similar to Orphacol with respect to two of the five therapeutic indications claimed i.e. 3β
HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiencies (see Appendix 1). The CHMP also concluded that Cholic acid was not

considered safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to Orphacol (see Appendix 2).

Following the outcome of the clinical superiority report, the applicant withdrew from the application the

indications 3β-HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiencies. The scope of the application was reduced to the

following 3 indications:

  - *Sterol 27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX) deficiency*

  - *2- (or α-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency*

  - *Cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency”*

As a result, the report on the clinical superiority (Appendix 2) is not relevant for the purpose of this

opinion as Kolbam is not anymore similar to Orphacol in the claimed indications.
##### **MA under exceptional circumstances **

In accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Annex I, of the Directive

2001/83/EC the applicant applied for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The

applicant argued that he was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under

normal conditions of use because the indications for which Kolbam are intended are encountered so

rarely that he cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence. The applicant also

argued that it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such

information.

The CHMP agreed on these justifications and considered that the criteria defined in the above
mentioned provision are met for the 3 indications claimed:
###### *Inability to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of the indication*

The three indications for which Kolbam is intended are rarely encountered. Indeed, cholic acid has

been designated as Orphan Medicinal Product (EU/3/02/683) by the European Commission for the

treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis on 09 December 2011. At the time of

designation, inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis re affected approximately 0.07 in 10,000

people in the EU. Over a 17 years period of study the applicant was able to recruit only 54 patients

affected by the condition. Given the rarity of the diseases, the CHMP considered that the applicant

cannot be reasonably expected to provide comprehensive non-clinical and clinical evidence. Patients

are so rarely identified that conduct of a controlled clinical trial would be unachievable.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 70/97


-----

###### *Inability to collect comprehensive information because it would be contrary to medical ethics *

It would be contrary to medical ethics principles to collect evidence of clinical efficacy of cholic acid in

the three intended indications in a controlled clinical study. A controlled study implies withholding the

sole existing treatment, cholic acid, at least for a limited period of time. A number of studies have

shown that an interruption of bile acid treatment of patients may lead to a rapid deterioration of liver

function tests and increases in the production of hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acids (Vanderpas et al.

1987; Koopman et al. 1988; Kobayashi et al. 2000; Yamato et al. 2001). Therefore, participation in a

controlled clinical trial would expose patients to a risk of severe hepatic damage, or even death.
##### **2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy **

In an uncontrolled trial, statistical tests of pre-treatment to post-treatment changes to draw inferences

on efficacy are confounded by time and by concomitant therapeutic interventions and patient

management. Hence, a close scrutiny of individual profiles of response and a clear biological and

pharmacological rationale for the intervention, substantiated by basic science and literature data, is the

basis on which to draw conclusions about therapeutic efficacy. The conclusion of therapeutic efficacy is

made considering results across all single enzyme defects included in the trial. This rationale can then

be applied to each single enzyme defect under consideration based on knowledge of disease pathology

and cholic acid pharmacology, in addition to the available clinical trial and literature data. Whilst the

magnitude of changes in metabolic and pathologic parameters may differ in each different phenotype

(noting also that clinical prognosis differs by phenotype), it is evident that Kolbam will be

therapeutically efficacious in the treatment of CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.

The efficacy analysis from the pivotal Study 91-10-10 showed that the patient numbers in the 5

enzymes deficiencies studied were often too low to enable statistically significant results. When the

individual single enzyme defect disorder types were assessed, general improvements in the degree of

atypical urine bile acids and in LFTs were seen. Treatment with CA statistically significantly improved

urine bile acid scores in patients with single enzyme defects considered as a group; significance was

achieved for patients with defects in the single enzymes 3β-HSD or ∆ [4] -3-oxo-R in the best pre
treatment to best post-treatment analysis. Statistically significant improvements in LFT scores were

also shown in the best to best ITT and mITT analyses for patients with single enzyme defects

considered as a group. Shifts towards improvements in ALT and AST values were shown in individual

defect groups; statistical significance was only reached in the 3ß-HSD patients.

Treatment with CA improved height and weight percentiles in patients with single enzyme defects, but

only the changes in weight were statistically significant for both the ITT and mITT sets for the single

enzyme defect considered as a group. Shifts towards increases in height and weight were generally

shown in each individual group; however, statistical significance was only reached for the change in

weight of patients with defects in *3ß-HSD* . While weight is not sole indicator of efficacy of CA

treatment, it supports the results seen for the more direct measures of efficacy urinary bile acids and

LFTs. Height, on the other hand, is a highly multifactorial parameter that may not be expected to

change significantly. However, a trend for increased growth was also seen in the height analyses.

Ursodeoxycholic acid was originally the co-study medication together with CA, but was discontinued

from June 2001. That URSO treatment had no impact on the overall efficacy of CA treatment was

confirmed in subgroup analyses comparing patients with CA monotherapy to those who have at least

once received URSO treatment. Patients with and without concomitant URSO treatment showed

statistically significant improvements in urinary bile acids and in LFTs from worst pre- to best post
treatment visits. Although no analysis by primary diagnosis was provided these observations supports

the efficacy of CA as monotherapy.

EMA/689761/2015 Page 71/97


-----

The clinical data from the literature review support the demonstration of efficacy of CA reported in the

pivotal study CAC-91-10-10, as measured also by objective improvement in metabolic and pathologic

parameters in patients reported. Cholic acid has been used since 1990 to treat patients who have

inborn errors of bile acid synthesis (Setchell *et al* . 2006, Heubi *et al* . 2007).

Taken together, although the data remains limited, the results confirmed that oral CA treatment down
regulates the synthesis of atypical bile acids, provides an effective therapy by reducing the production

of hepatotoxic bile acid intermediates, and has a palliative effect on the patient’s clinical course that

may translate into improved and prolonged life. The body of clinical data primarily from Study CAC-91
10-10 and its continuation study CAC-002-001 showed evidence relevant to the understanding of the

therapeutic efficacy of CA in the treatment of inborn errors of the synthesis of primary bile acids.

Overall, the CHMP is able to conclude that Kolbam has therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of patients

with CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.

On 13 September 2013 the Commission granted a marketing authorisation for the orphan medicinal

product Orphacol. In accordance with Articles 8(1) and 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, the

applicant submitted a report on similarity of Kolbam to Orphacol and a report claiming the derogation

of Orphacol’s market exclusivity based on clinical superiority to Orphacol. The CHMP considered that

Kolbam was similar to Orphacol with respect to two of the five therapeutic indications claimed i.e. 3β
HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiencies (see Appendix 1). The CHMP also concluded that Cholic acid was not

considered safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to Orphacol (see Appendix 2).

Following the outcome of the clinical superiority report, the applicant withdrew from the application the

indications 3β-HSD and Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiencies. The scope of the application was reduced to the

following 3 indications:

  - *Sterol 27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX) deficiency*

  - *2- (or α-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency*

  - *Cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency”*

As a result, the report on the clinical superiority (Appendix 2) is not relevant for the purpose of this

opinion as Kolbam is not anymore similar to Orphacol in the claimed indications.

Based on the above, the CHMP endorsed that due to the rarity of the condition, the provision of

comprehensive data, particularly randomised controlled clinical trials is not feasible. The CHMP also

endorsed the argumentation on inability to collect comprehensive information because it would be

contrary to medical ethics principles. Data submitted is limited as expected in such rare condition it is

nevertheless considered that the clinical data presented in this application are sufficient to support

demonstration of efficacy and safety of cholic acid in the three claimed indications. A marketing

authorisation under exceptional circumstances for Kolbam is acceptable in regards to the fulfilled

criteria of rarity of the disease and medical ethics.

In the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances a specific obligation is included in the terms of

the Marketing Authorisation. The applicant will monitor the long term efficacy in patients treated with

Kolbam from a patient registry for which details are reflected in the risk management plan. The

registry will monitor accumulating data on efficacy in the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid

synthesis due CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies with Kolbam in infants, children, adolescents and

adults. Reports on recruitment progress of the registry will be reported at the time of PSURs and

Annual Re-assessments. Progress and results from the registry will form the basis of the annual

reassessments of the benefit/risk profile of Kolbam.
##### ***2.6. Clinical safety ***

The safety data of CA were collected in Study CAC-91-10-10 and CAC-001-01. In addition safety data

from study CAC-002-001 (continuation study from CAC-91-10-10 and CAC-001-01) and safety data

reported in the literature were reported. **Patient exposure **

When study CAC-91-10-10 was started in 1992, CA in combination with URSO was used as study

medication. However, once the Investigators concluded that URSO was not effective in the treatment

of defects in bile acid synthesis, URSO was removed as study medication. Most frequently patients

have received CA treatment alone. Other frequent treatment regimens included CA and URSO either in

combination or as single treatments following each other. Very few patients received CDCA or

docosahexenic acid (DHCA). CDCA was used during the earlier years for treatment of bile acid defects,

but is now contraindicated since it was found to be hepatotoxic (e.g. Chenodiol prescribing

information). DHCA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is used in the treatment of patients with

peroxisomal disorders to support brain development.

The majority of patients received orally CA doses of up to about 15 mg/kg body weight per day.

Twelve patients received daily doses >20 mg/kg. Two patients received the highest doses with 61.5

and 58.1 mg/kg/day, respectively. The application of higher doses was generally based on rational

decisions, e.g. due to increased urinary bile or transaminase values. The majority of patients included

in the safety set had received treatment with CA; on average for a duration of 145 weeks. At least one

patient had received CA for a maximum of 545 weeks. The mean treatment duration for URSO was 82

weeks, and in accordance with the deletion as study medication shorter than the overall treatment

duration for CA. DHCA and CDCA were used by a limited number of patients only, but particularly

DHCA was used for up to 259 weeks. **Adverse events **

***Study CAC-91-10-10***

The table below presents the most frequent treatment-emergent AEs [TEAEs] (i.e. AEs reported by at

least 2 patients) by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). On the SOC level,

general disorders and administration site conditions were the most frequent TEAEs, followed by

gastrointestinal disorders and infections and infestations. On the preferred term level, disease

progression was the most common TEAE followed by pyrexia and diarrhea.

Causalities are summarized below. For only 2 patients the AEs were assessed by the investigator as

treatment-related or relationship unknown. For the remaining patients the AEs were considered

unrelated to study medication treatment. The most frequent alternative reason documented was

deterioration of the disease under study.

The intensities of TEAEs are summarized below. TEAEs were predominantly mild or moderate in

intensity. Only 10 patients (13%) experienced AEs of severe intensity. These were most frequently

related to disease progression (9 patients). The only other severe AE occurring in at least two patients

was dehydration.

Patients could be included in more than one category. Each patient counted once per category.
N = number of patients.

Most patients with TEAEs recovered from the AEs; for 13 patients the outcome was unknown. Only

three patients (4%) had not recovered from the AEs (1 patient with portal hypertension, 1 patient with

ovarian cyst and ovarian failure, and 1 patient with convulsion). For seven patients death was

documented as outcome, either due to the respective AE or due to other causes. For two patients non
TEAEs (both ‘disease progression’) were documented prior to the patient’s death; a patient died due to

the AE, the other patient died due to other causes. For the remaining 12 patients who died during the

study, no AE was documented as potential cause of death.

***Study CAC-001-01***

There were 13 AEs reported for 9 of 16 patients in the study. AEs judged not related to study drug

included 5 incidents of low vitamin A, D, or 25-OHD; 1 incident of nausea and 1 incident of vomiting

(same patient), 1 abdominal muscle spasm, 1 nose bleed. There were 2 incidents of slightly elevated

liver function tests (1 each ALT and AST for the same patient) judged to be unlikely to be related to

the study drug, and 1 incident each of mild reflux and moderate diarrhoea (different patients) said to

be possibly related to the study drug.

*Deaths*

A total of 21 patients died during the study period (and an additional death occurred after the cut-off

of the reporting period). Only for 10 of the expired patients an AE had been documented. Disease

progression or an event secondary to worsening of the underlying condition was the most frequently

noted AE. For none of these patients the death was considered related to study medication treatment.

EMA/689761/2015 Page 75/97


-----

Thirteen (13) patients were no longer being followed by CCHMC at the time of death. The patient’s

death was frequently reported only a long time after the death occurred, often through contacts with

the primary treating physician. Efforts to retrieve additional information from the patient family or

primary caregiver were unsuccessful. However, based on the severe, potentially fatal disease,

worsening of the underlying condition was considered a reasonable assumption for most cases.

Fifteen of the 21 patients who died suffered from peroxisomal disorder, mainly Zellweger’s syndrome.

Of the six patients with single enzyme defects who died, four suffered from Δ [4] -3-oxoR deficiency.

There was a clear trend that worsening of the underlying condition leading to death occurred more

often in patients with a peroxisomal disorder. This is not unexpected as patients with Zellweger’s

syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum’s disease typically present

with significant comorbidities often including CNS impairment which would not be treated by

addressing the bile defect effects. Almost all patients who died had been diagnosed with a defect in bile

acid synthesis prior to 1 year of age, four patients were 1 year of age at diagnosis and one patient was

3 years of age

*Serious adverse events*

All treatment-emergent SAEs documented during the study period are summarized below. SAEs

occurred in a total of 16 patients. Disease progression was the most frequently reported SAE, followed

by urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, and dehydration. All other SAEs occurred in single patients only.

None of the SAEs were considered related to study medication treatment by the Investigator. Unless a

patient died due to the SAE, the vast majority of patients recovered. Only for one patient each with

serious gastric ulcer and disease progression, the SAE outcome was unknown.

*Diarrhoea and Gastroenteritis*

Diarrhoea is a known side effect of excessive dosing with CA. During the 18-year study period,

diarrhoea was documented for six patients. One of these patients and another four patients complained

of gastroenteritis or enteritis, however, for three the gastroenteritis was of viral cause. One case of

viral gastroenteritis occurred prior to study medication start. All events of diarrhea and gastro-enteritis

were of mild intensity, except for one case of moderately intense diarrhea and one case of severe

diarrhea. There was no correlation between the severity of diarrhea and daily CA doses; patients with

higher severity events had received regular CA doses only. None of the cases of enteritis or diarrhoea

were assessed as related to study medication treatment. All patients with enteritis or diarrhoea

recovered, with the exception of one patient who died due to other causes. Shortly prior to the death

the patient had experienced severe coagulopathy, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, epistaxis, and

diarrhea secondary to end stage liver disease.

**Table 32** **Patients with the Treatment-emergent AEs (Gastro-)enteritis and Diarrhea**

a MedDRA version 11.0
a Adverse event started on 26 Jan 1993, prior to the first study medication intake on 27 Jan 1993.

One case of moderate diarrhoea was reported in study CAC-001-01 which was possibly related to the

treatment.

In general, the potential to produce diarrhoea with CA dosing is quite low in infants and children or

even adults. Children clearly would not be prone to diarrhoea with CA until prepuberty or puberty when

they would have body weights similar to adults. Bile acid diarrhoea is caused by the cathartic and other

related effects on colonic epithelium that leads to water and electrolyte secretion. It was recognized by

Mekhjian *et al* . 1971 that to induce water and electrolyte secretion, it was necessary to achieve a

faecal level of at least 3 mmol/L of dihydroxy bile acids (chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acid) to

produce this effect. They found that CA and URSO did not affect water and electrolyte secretion. In

addition, it was later recognized that the levels necessary to produce diarrhoea had to be present in

the water phase of stool and that a critical pH needed to be present to allow bile acids to have their

effect on the colonic epithelium (McJunkin *et al* . 1981).

Normal children excrete bile acids at the rate of 90.8 mg/m [2] /day with 0.50 mmol/L in the aqueous

phase (Heubi *et al* . 1979). In children with a small bowel resection leading to loss of the ileum and its

ability to conserve bile acids, the total faecal bile acids are 797 mg/m [2] /day with 5.41 mmol/L in stool

(Heubi *et al* . 1980) which indicates that in case of total interruption of the recovery of bile acids by the

intestine, it is possible to have levels in the stool that would be capable of stimulating water and

electrolyte secretion. However, if healthy humans receive exogenous bile acids by oral application, a

fixed size pool of bile acids is maintained because of a sensitive feedback inhibition system on the

synthesis of bile acids. As such it would not be anticipated that humans have enough stool loss of bile

acids, even with CA supplementation, to produce excessive stool bile acid levels or levels in the water

component of the stool until a child achieved a much larger body size and bile acid pool. Although

treatment doses of CDA may produce diarrhoea, CA would have to be converted to deoxycholic acid to

have a cathartic effect. The conversion of CA to deoxycholic acid is likely to be relatively modest (no

more than 1/2 of the dose) and not sufficient to produce enough deoxycholic acid to stimulate water

and electrolyte secretion with resultant diarrhoea.

***Study CAC-001-01***

There were no deaths, and no adverse events were determined to be serious or significant.
##### **Laboratory findings **

***Study CAC-91-10-10***

Changes in liver function tests (serum transaminases) and bilirubin are analysed as efficacy endpoints.

The results are presented in the efficacy section. No other clinical laboratory data were analysed.

***Study CAC-001-01***

There were 2 incidents of slightly elevated liver function tests (1 each ALT and AST for the same

patient) judged to be unlikely to be related to the study drug **Safety in special populations **

*Pregnancy*

Psychoyos *et al* . 1989 reported that HPLC analysis of the embryo-toxic fraction of human uterine fluid,

collected between the 22 [nd] and 25 [th] day of the menstrual cycle, revealed the presence of CA at high

concentrations. It was suggested that CA could be responsible for the embryotoxicity of the uterine

environment, which follows the receptive period for implantation. However, Gonzales *et al.* 2009

reported four normal pregnancies in two patients resulting in the birth of four healthy infants while

patients were treated with CA. This suggests that CA is unlikely to be embryotoxic and is safe when

taken at therapeutic doses during pregnancy. GC-MS surveillance confirmed continued compliance with

therapy by these two patients during pregnancy with maintenance of consistent bile acid metabolism.

*Lactation*

No data are available in lactating women. However no effects are anticipated on the breast-fed infant

since the systemic exposure of the breast-feeding woman to CA are negligible given the low serum

levels.

*Elderly*

Safety in patients over the age of 65 has not been established.

*Children*

Cholic acid can be recommended for infants over the age of one month, older children and adults

based on the available clinical data. The recommended dosage is 10-15 mg/kg/day. There is

insufficient data to establish the safety of efficacy of CA in children under the age of one month.

*Hepatic impairment*

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 78/97


-----

No data regarding CA treatment are available in patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism

that have hepatic impairment unrelated to their primary disease (CAC-91-10-10; Gonzalez *et al* . 2009).

If such patients are encountered, decreased hepatic clearance of bile acids and/or cholestasis could

occur, leading to increased serum concentrations of CA and symptoms/signs of toxicity (primarily

pruritus and diarrhoea). Intuitively, the CA dose should be reduced which may reduce toxicity but

could result in inadequate suppression of the biosynthesis of the hepatotoxic and cholestatic bile acid

metabolites and recurrence of the manifestations of the primary disease. As such, in the absence of

clinical experience in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than the genetic bile acid

enzyme deficiencies, no recommendations on dosage adjustment can be made. It is essential that

patients with hepatic impairment unrelated to their primary disease that are treated with CA be

monitored closely.

*Renal impairment*

No data are available for patients with renal impairment. Bile acids including CA are excreted in the

urine in negligible amounts and compromised renal function would not be expected to result in

systemic accumulation and toxicity. For patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that are

successfully treated with CA, development of renal failure may have little or no impact on systemic bile

acid concentrations. However, these patients should be carefully monitored and the dose of CA titrated

individually.

*Overdose*

Gonzales *et al* . 2009 reported apparent signs of CA overdose in four children (one of which was

accidental administration of 56 mg/kg as a single dose) with clinical features including pruritus,

diarrhoea, and elevation of serum GGT, ALT, and total serum bile acid concentration. However, these

increases returned to normal after CA dose reduction. Moreover, CA is an endogenous primary bile acid

and a normal end product of cholesterol metabolism in healthy humans and animals. As such, orally

administered exogenous CA will be subject to established physiological mechanisms of absorption,

distribution, metabolism and excretion and multiple feedback processes are constantly engaged in

managing the enterohepatic recirculation of the bile acid pool. In the event of overdosage the patient

should be monitored and treated symptomatically. There is no specific antidote.
##### **Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions **

No safety data related to drug-drug interactions or other interactions have been presented. **Discontinuation due to adverse events **

Treatment-emergent AEs that led to study discontinuation are presented below. A total of four patients

discontinued the study due to AEs. The AE most frequently leading to study discontinuation was

disease progression. All other AEs leading to study discontinuation occurred in single patients only.

One patient who discontinued the study after TEAEs died, 1 patient recovered from the associated AE

(disease progression), and for 2 patients who discontinued due to AEs (disease progression and

cholestasis) the outcome was unknown. None of the AEs leading to study discontinuation was

considered related to study medication treatment by the Investigator.

During the 33-month study period, approximately half of the patients experienced TEAEs. Vitamin D

decreased was the most common TEAE followed by disease progression, hepatic enzyme increased and

upper respiratory tract infection. Study drug-related AEs were only reported for 2 patients, none of the

TEAEs was serious (mild peripheral neuropathy and mild nausea) and both resolved. Four patients

discontinued the study due to TEAEs: disease progression in 3 patients and peripheral neurophathy in

1 patient. Two patients who discontinued due to disease progression died and the 2 others recovered.

Treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 7 patients. Disease progression was the most frequently

reported treatment-emergent SAE, occurring in 2 patients with single enzyme defects and 2 patients

with peroxisomal disorder. All other SAEs occurred only once. None of the SAEs was considered related

to CA by the Investigator. A total of 3 patients died during the study period all due to AEs; two patients

due to disease progression which was associated with a multisystem failure in one patient, and one

patient due to thrombosis following liver transplantation. Two patients who died suffered from

peroxisomal disorders, one patient from a single enzyme defect. After the data cut-off date of the

reporting period, one additional patient died as a result of sepsis following a pamidronate infusion.

None of the AEs leading to death was considered related to study treatment by the Investigator. Data

on available laboratory values and physical examinations did not reveal any clinically significant

changes. **Literature reports **

Very few adverse events to CA are reported in the literature. No clear quantification of the frequency of

a given adverse reaction is possible, as either no adverse reactions occurred, or the period of

observation was undefined. Gonzales *et al* . 2009 observed no serious adverse events. Signs of acute

and chronic CA overdose were observed, however, in 4 children with 3β-HSD deficiency. Chronic

overdose, presumably due to prescription of an excessive dose, was shown to be related to transient

increases in serum bile acids, GGT and transaminase activities. While not noted as an adverse event, 1

patient with 3β-HSD deficiency in this population was described to have developed gallstones requiring

cholecystectomy during CA treatment for more than five years.

In Potin *et al.* 2001, ten children diagnosed with HSD3ß7 and two children with ∆ *[4]* *-3-oxo-R* deficiency

were included in a clinical trial to assess the effect of treatment with CA and with a combination of CA

and ursodeoxycholic acid. Cholic acid treatment was well tolerated in 11 of these 12 children. Only one

patient developed pruritus under therapy, which completely disappeared after dose reduction from

15 mg/kg/day down to 5 mg/kg/day.
##### **2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety **

In study CAC-91-10-10, during the 18 years of the study period, approximately half of patients

experienced TEAEs. Disease progression was the most common TEAE followed by pyrexia and diarrhea.

TEAEs were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. Study drug related AEs were only reported

for two patients (malaise and jaundice in 1 patient; skin lesion in another patient) and none were

serious. Four patients discontinued the study due to TEAEs. The AE most frequently leading to study

discontinuation was disease progression. None of the AEs leading to study discontinuation was

considered related to study treatment by the Investigator. Treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 16

patients. Disease progression was the most frequently reported SAE, followed by urinary tract

infection, diarrhoea and dehydration. No SAEs were considered related to the study drug. A total of 21

patients died during the study period. Thirteen (13) patients were no longer being followed by CCHMC

at the time of the patient’s death. There was a clear trend that worsening of the underlying condition

leading to death occurred more often in patients with a peroxisomal disorder, as fifteen of the 21

patients who died suffered from peroxisomal disorder, mainly Zellweger’s syndrome. Of the six

patients with single enzyme defects who died, four suffered from ∆ *[4]* *-3-oxo-R* deficiency. Almost all

patients who died had been diagnosed with a bile acid deficiency before the age of one. For none of the

patients the death was considered related to study medication treatment. Based on the severe,

potentially fatal disease, worsening of the underlying condition can be considered a reasonable

assumption for most cases.

In study CAC-001-01; there were 13 AEs reported for 9 of 16 patients. The AEs reported were

generally in line with those reported in the pivotal trial. There were 2 incidents of slightly elevated liver

function tests (1 each ALT and AST for the same patient) judged to be unlikely to be related to the

study drug, and 1 incident each of mild reflux and moderate diarrhoea (different patients) said to be

possibly related to the study drug. There were no deaths, and no adverse events were determined to

be serious or significant.

The safety data reported from study CAC-002-001 were also generally in line with those reported in

the pivotal trial. The most common TEAEs were Vitamin D decreased, disease progression, hepatic

enzyme increased and upper respiratory tract infection. Mild peripheral neuropathy and mild nausea

were the two reported drug-related AEs. The main SAE reported was disease progression and none of

the SAEs were considered drug-related. Three patients died of disease progression and thrombosis;

these events were not related to the study treatment. Of the 29 patients affected by a single

enzymatic defect (3β-HSD, Δ [4] -3-oxo-R or CTX) that were treated in Study CAC-002-01 3 patients

discontinued (all due to AEs), and one patient died.

The impossibility to conduct controlled studies was recognised by the CHMP in regards to the rarity of

the condition and the ethical considerations. In the absence of controlled trial data, it remains difficult

to ascertain causality regarding unfavourable effect. This is a methodologically driven outcome of a

trial design which has no comparator arm hence impacting on the possibility to assess whether an

adverse event is related to the study drug. However, this absence of the formal establishment of the

causality does not prevent that the clinical safety data reported from the study showed that the clinical

safety of Kolbam given at appropriate doses is satisfactory. The majority of the event observed in

treated patients are mild or moderate in intensity (diarrhoea, reflux, nausea, malaise, jaundice and

skin lesion), there were no serious event related to CA treatment, the events were transitory and

generally did not interfere with the therapy. Mainly events were related to the disease progression

rather than being related to CA treatment.

The applicant provided a review of the literature in order to support the safety of CA. Very few

adverse events under CA treatment were reported in the literature. The only documented adverse

reactions to CA are pruritus and diarrhoea, which may be indicative of an overdose. No clear

quantification of the frequency of a given adverse reaction is possible, as either no adverse reactions

occurred, or the period of observation was undefined. No serious adverse events have been reported in

the literature. All other adverse events that have been reported appeared linked to an over dosage of

CA, were not serious, reversible and did not interfere with therapy. No patient interrupted or stopped

treatment due to adverse events. Gonzales *et al* . reported apparent signs of CA overdose in four

children (one of which was accidental administration of 56 mg/kg as a single dose) with clinical

features including pruritus, diarrhoea, and elevation of serum GGT, ALT, and total serum bile acid

concentration. However, these increases were transient and returned to normal after CA dose

reduction. The SmPC contains guidance that patients should be intensively monitored for their

biochemical response and liver functions tests during the initiation of therapy and at least annually

thereafter, and that the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.

The majority of patients with inborn errors of bile acid metabolism that have been treated with CA

presented with some degree of hepatic impairment at the time of diagnosis; in most patients, the

hepatic impairment improved or resolved with treatment. The dose of CA should be adjusted

individually. No experience exists in patients with hepatic impairment from causes other than their

primary disease and no dose recommendation can be given. Patients with hepatic impairment should

be monitored closely.

The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy was observed in the literature in a single

patient with 3β-HSD deficiency. Development of gallstones has also been observed in cholic-acid-fed

rodents on a high-cholesterol diet. An enrichment of bile with deoxycholic acid, as seen in patients

under treatment with CA, may be linked to biliary cholesterol super-saturation and may accelerate

gallstone development. The development of gallstones on CA treatment is considered a potential risk

that will be monitored as part of the Risk Management Plan.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Summary of Product Characteristics.
##### **Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional ** **circumstances **

In the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances a specific obligation is included in the terms of

the Marketing Authorisation. The applicant will monitor the long term safety in patients treated with

Kolbam from a patient registry for which details are reflected in the risk management plan. The

registry will monitor accumulating data on safety in the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid

synthesis due CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies with Kolbam in infants, children, adolescents and

adults. Reports on recruitment progress of the registry will be reported at the time of PSURs and

Annual Re-assessments. Progress and results from the registry will form the basis of the annual

reassessments of the benefit/risk profile of Kolbam. **2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety **

Data reported from the open label studies conducted showed that the clinical safety of CA in the

treatment of CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies, given at appropriate doses appeared satisfactory.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 82/97


-----

The majority of the event observed in treated patients were mild or moderate in intensity (diarrhoea,

reflux, nausea, malaise, jaundice and skin lesion), there were no serious event related to CA

treatment, the events were transitory and generally did not interfere with the therapy. Mainly events

were related to the disease progression rather than being related to CA treatment. The uncontrolled

nature of the data rendered difficult to evaluate the causal association with CA however it does not

prevent to conclude that the AEs reported with Kolbam therapy appeared generally to be not serious

and mostly related to the underlying disease condition. There have been six patients with single

enzyme defects who died over 18 years of the study period. Worsening of the underlying condition is

considered a reasonable assumption for most cases although not all complete information were

available despite all efforts made by the applicant to retrieve it.

The safety data from the case reports from the literature are generally consistent with the safety

profile reported in the pivotal trial. The adverse events that have been reported are mainly linked to an

over dosage of CA i.e. pruritus and diarrhoea. No serious adverse events have been reported in the

literature. No patient interrupted or stopped treatment due to adverse events. Patients presenting with

pruritus and/or persistent diarrhoea should be investigated for a potential overdose by a serum and/or

urine bile acid assay. Overdose was also associated with elevated serum GGT and transaminases. The

development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed in a single patient with 3β
HSD deficiency. The development of gallstones on CA treatment is considered a potential risk that will

be monitored as part of the Risk Management Plan.

The applicant as specific obligation will monitor the long term safety of CA in the treatment of CTX,

AMACR and CYP7A1 by establishing a patient registry. The CHMP considered this registry as adequate

in order to monitor the clinical safety of CA.
##### ***2.7. Pharmacovigilance *** **Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system **

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the

legislative requirements. ***2.8. Risk Management Plan ***

The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: **PRAC Advice **

Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.7, the PRAC considers by consensus

that the risk management system for cholic acid (Kolbam) for the treatment:

of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, responsive to treatment with cholic acid, in

infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood

is acceptable.

This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk

minimisation measures were sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indications.

As additional risk minimisation measure an educational material has been deemed appropriate by the

PRAC in order to convey information to the prescribers on the correct and safe use of the product.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.
##### ***2.9. Significance of paediatric studies ***

The CHMP is of the opinion that study CAC-91-10-10, which is contained in the agreed Paediatric

Investigation Plan P/206/2011 and has been completed after 26 January 2007, is considered as

significant. This is the pivotal study for the intended indications as detailed in the above-mentioned

PIP. The justification is that the data generated and results of this study taken together provided

important and clinically relevant information for the paediatric population in line with the EU

communication (Guideline on the format and content of applications for agreement or modification of a

paediatric investigation plan and requests for waivers or deferrals and concerning the operation of the

compliance check and on criteria for assessing significant studies (2008/C 243/01). This view is in line

with the EMEA/PDCO opinion on a request for agreement of a Paediatric Investigation Plan on Kolbam

(EMEA-000651-PIP01-09-M02), in which it is stated: “The PDCO considered that this study, which will

be completed after the entry into force of the Regulation, could be significant with respect to Article 45

(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended.” ***2.10. User consultation ***

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on

the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
### **3. Benefit-Risk Balance **
##### ***Benefits *** **Beneficial effects **

Cholic acid has been shown to have a beneficial effect in patients with inborn errors of primary bile acid

synthesis responsive to treatment with cholic acid. The clinical use of cholic acid has been documented

since at least the mid-1990s. Oral administration of cholic acid replaces the substance missing in

patients with these in born errors. Cholic acid inhibits the production of cholestatic and hepatotoxic bile

acid metabolites by down-regulating cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in bile acid

synthesis (Setchell and O’Connell 2007). Metabolites are cleared due to the choleretic effect of cholic

acid and rapidly disappear from the patients’ urine. As a result, biochemical liver parameters such as

transaminases and bilirubin more slowly normalise and histological liver damage is attenuated or even

improves. Finally, the administered cholic acid restores a normal enterohepatic circulation and

absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins occurs resolving growth deficits or outright rickets.

In study CAC-91-10-10 there are indications, consistent with clinical expectations and literature data,

for decreased urinary bile acid excretion in patients with single enzyme defects (CTX and AMACR).

General improvements in the degree of atypical urine bile acids were also seen as well as shifts

towards improvements in ALT and AST values.

Assessment report
EMA/689761/2015 Page 86/97


-----

In an uncontrolled trial, statistical tests of pre-treatment to post-treatment changes to draw inferences

on efficacy are confounded by time and by concomitant therapeutic interventions and patient

management. Hence, a close scrutiny of individual profiles of response and a clear biological and

pharmacological rationale for the intervention, substantiated by basic science and literature data, is the

basis on which to draw conclusions about therapeutic efficacy. The conclusion of therapeutic efficacy is

made considering results across all single enzyme defects included in the trial. This rationale can then

be applied to each single enzyme defect under consideration based on knowledge of disease pathology

and cholic acid pharmacology, in addition to the available clinical trial and literature data. In particular,

it is agreed with the applicant that in each of these enzyme deficiencies, the elevated transaminases

and abnormal liver histology result from the abnormal bile acids that occur as a consequence of the

blockage of the CA biosynthetic pathway by the enzyme defects. For each of these deficiencies, the

therapeutic benefit of CA derives from the same mechanism, namely the ability to inhibit transcription

of the 7-alpha hydroxylase (at the head of the pathway through an FXR-dependent mechanism)

(Setchell and O-Connell, 2007) or provides benefit to patients by providing CA to patients. Whilst the

magnitude of changes in metabolic and pathologic parameters may differ in each different phenotype

(noting also that clinical prognosis differs by phenotype), it is evident that Kolbam will be

therapeutically efficacious in the treatment of CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.

Overall, Kolbam is recognised as having beneficial effect in patients with inborn errors of primary bile

acid synthesis that are due to CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.
##### **Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects **

The rarity and the requirement for long term treatment of this condition makes the conduct of an

adequately powered and controlled clinical study not feasible. Inborn errors in primary bile acid

synthesis remain a condition that is debilitating in the long term and life threatening. It would be

contrary to principles of medical ethics to collect evidence of clinical efficacy of CA in a controlled

clinical study.

The uncontrolled data makes difficult to ascertain the magnitude of the beneficial effects of CA.

However, the clinical data presented in this application are sufficiently comprehensive to support

demonstration of efficacy of CA in the claimed indications as measured by objective improvement in

metabolic and pathologic parameters in patients studied. The applicant will monitor the long term

efficacy in patients treated with cholic acid from a patient registry. The registry will monitor

accumulating data on efficacy. Reports will be submitted as part of the PSURs and annual re
assessments. ***Risks *** **Unfavourable effects **

In general, adverse effects seen with CA therapy appear to be not serious, reversible, mainly related to

elevated hepatic enzymes and appear to be dose-related. Cases of diarrhoea and pruritus have been

reported in the literature. The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed

in a single patient with 3β-HSD deficiency.

The CHMP took due account of the fact that CA is an endogenous molecule present in normal human

bile, blood and other biological fluids. Once administered CA will behave like an endogenous molecule

in all respects. At physiological concentrations, CA is non-toxic, thereby providing a safe dose range for

use in human. Substantial knowledge of human CA physiology in healthy subjects as well as patients

treated at current pharmacological doses with chronic liver diseases exists. It should be also noted that

CA is used in foods as a food additive (E 1000) and that historically medicinal products containing CA

have been used for other indications, such as laxatives and choleretics since at least the early part of

the 20 [th] century.
##### **Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects **

In the absence of controlled trial data, it is difficult to comprehensively ascertain causality regarding

unfavourable effects. This is a methodologically driven outcome of a trial design which has no

comparator arm hence impacting on the possibility to assess whether an adverse event is related to

the investigational drug. However, this absence of the formal establishment of the causality does not

prevent that the clinical data reported to support this application showed that the safety of CA in the

treatment of inborn error of primary bile acid synthesis that are due to CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1

deficiencies, is satisfactory in view of the results presented and the established safety profile of this

endogenous molecule. The applicant will monitor the long term safety of cholic acid treatment as part

of a patient registry. Reports will be submitted as part of the PSURs and Annual Re-assessments. ***Benefit-risk balance *** **Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects **

Effective treatment with oral CA therapy has been shown to restore normal laboratory parameters;

improve histological lesions of the liver, and significantly improve patient symptoms. Analysis of urine

during CA therapy showed a marked reduction, or even complete elimination of the toxic bile acid

metabolites. This reflects restoration of an effective feedback control of bile acid synthesis and a

metabolic equilibrium.

Kolbam has been shown to have a palliative effect on the patient’s clinical course by decreasing urinary

bile acid excretion in patients with CTX, AMACR deficiencies. Improvements in the degree of atypical

urine bile acids were also seen as well as shifts towards improvements in ALT and AST values.

The adverse events reported were not serious, reversible and mainly linked to an over dosage.

Transient increases transaminase activities have been also observed in chronic over dosage in the

literature. The development of gallstones requiring cholecystectomy has been observed in a single

patient with 3β-HSD deficiency. Therefore the safety profile of CA is acceptable. **Benefit-risk balance **

Kolbam appeared as effective and rather well tolerated for the long-term treatment of inborn errors of

primary bile acid synthesis that are due to CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.

The conclusion of therapeutic efficacy is made considering results across all single enzyme defects

included in the trial. This rationale can then be applied to each single enzyme defect under

consideration based on knowledge of disease pathology and cholic acid pharmacology, in addition to

the available clinical trial and literature data.

The adverse events observed under CA oral treatment in study CAC-90-10-10 appeared not serious,

reversible, and mainly related to the disease progression rather than being related to CA treatment.

Cases of diarrhoea and pruritus linked to an over dosage of CA were reported in the literature

submitted. Overall, the safety profile of CA appears acceptable. It should be noted that in conjunction

with the recommendation for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances, the specific

Assessment report

-----

obligation relates to the generation of follow-up safety data in a patient registry; these data will be

reviewed annually pursuant to article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

The CHMP evaluated the risks due to uncertainties and considers that these risks are not substantial in

the light of the demonstrated benefits. The benefits observed outweigh the risks involved with CA

treatment and therefore, the benefit /risk balance is considered positive for the treatment of CTX,

AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies.
##### ***Discussion on the benefit-risk balance ***

The liver disease associated with primary bile acids synthesis due to inborn error metabolism leading to

the production of hepatotoxic bile acid precursors is progressive and, if untreated, leads to death from

cirrhosis and liver failure. Currently there is no causal treatment. At the time the applicant submitted

this application, the only therapeutic option in severely affected cases was liver transplant. Orphacol

(cholic acid) was granted a MA on 13 September 2013 for the treatment of treatment of inborn errors

in primary bile acid synthesis due to 3β-HSD deficiency or ∆ [4] -3-oxoR deficiency in infants, children and

adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults.

In accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Annex I, part II of Directive

2001/83/EC the applicant applied for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The

applicant justified that he was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under

normal conditions of use because the indications for which Kolbam are intended are encountered so

rarely that he cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence. The applicant also

argued that it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such

information as participation in a controlled trial would expose patients to a risk of liver failure or even

death. The CHMP agreed on these justifications and considers that the criteria defined in the above
mentioned provisions were met. A marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for

Kolbam is acceptable in regards to the fulfilled criteria of rarity of the disease (the indications for which

the product is intended are so rare that the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to provide

comprehensive evidence) and medical ethics (it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of

medical ethics to collect such information).

Overall, the efficacy and safety of the product was demonstrated based on the results of open label

study CAC-90-10-10 supported by literature data. The use of CA for the treatment for inborn errors of

bile acid synthesis due to CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies has been recognised as effective and

the safety profile was considered satisfactory. The open label design and limited sample size of this

non-GCP compliant study limited the demonstration of efficacy as well as the causality assessment of

the adverse events observed. However, the results presented were considered sufficient to support

demonstration of efficacy of CA in the claimed indications. The results also showed that the safety

profile of CA is acceptable. In conclusion, the data submitted are sufficient to conclude on a positive

benefit–risk balance for an application made under exceptional circumstances.
### **4. Recommendations **
##### ***Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products ***

The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that, within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission

Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, Kolbam is not similar to Orphacol for the following indications: Sterol

27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX), 2- (or α-) methylacyl-CoA

racemase (AMACR) and Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiencies (See Appendix 1).
##### ***Outcome ***

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the risk-benefit balance of Kolbam in the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid synthesis

that are due to CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1 deficiencies is favourable. Therefore, the CHMP recommends

the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for Kolbam in the treatment of CTX, AMACR and CYP7A1

deficiencies under exceptional circumstances subject to the following conditions: ***Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use ***

Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product

Characteristics, section 4.2). ***Other conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation *** • **Periodic Safety Update Reports **
