## **2. Scientific discussion **
#### ***2.1. Introduction ***

Tigecycline is a member of tetracycline class of antibiotics that prevents bacterial growth by inhibiting

protein synthesis. Tigecycline inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal

subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. Tetracycline

antibiotics are active against a broad spectrum of bacteria. They have displayed in vitro activity against

the most common causative Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. In addition,

tigecycline has demonstrated activity against drug-resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant

Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and organisms producing extended
spectrum beta-lactamases (such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Tigecycline is a third
generation tetracycline, which has a modified structure for dealing with the known resistance

mechanisms of bacteria.

This application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) for Tigecycline Accord, powder

for solution for infusion, 50 mg/vial. The reference product is the centrally authorised medicinal

product Tygacil, which has been authorised in the EU since April 2006.

This product is exempt from conducting a bioequivalence study, in accordance with Appendix II of the

current Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). The

selected excipients are amongst the excipients listed in the innovator product Tygacil, except for

lactose monohydrate. Maltose monohydrate is used in the proposed formulation in place of lactose

monohydrate present in the innovator product Tygacil; both have similar physical properties.

Tigecycline Accord is intended for the same indication, using the same dosage regimen and route of

administration as Tygacil.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 6/16


-----

#### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

The finished product is presented as powder for solution for infusion containing 50 mg of tigecycline.

After reconstitution, 1 ml contains 10 mg of tigecycline.

Other ingredients are maltose monohydrate, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium

hydroxide (for pH adjustment).

The product is available in 10 ml Type 1 clear glass vials fitted with grey bromobutyl rubber stopper

and flip-off aluminium seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. **2.2.2. Active substance **

***General information***

The chemical name of tigecycline is (4 *S*, 4 *aS* 5 *aR*, 12 *aS* )-4, 7-bis(dimethylamino)-9-[[[(1,1
dimethylethyl)amino] Acetyl]amino]-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12 *a* -octahydro-3,10,12,12 a tetrahydroxy-1,11
dioxo-2- naphthacenecarboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C 29 H 39 N 5 O 8. It has a

molecular weight of 585.65 g/mol and the following structure:

**Figure 1: active substance structure**

The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, UV

spectrophotometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Liquid chromatography–mass

spectrometry (LC-MS). The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffraction.

The active substance is an orange, hygroscopic, powder. It is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in

anhydrous ethanol and in heptane.

Tigecycline exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Chiral centres present

in the active substance are derived from the starting material (minocycline HCl). Stereoisomeric purity

is routinely controlled in the active substance specifications, as per Ph. Eur.

Tigecycline is known to show polymorphism. Results from three consecutive active substance batches

confirm that the described manufacturing process consistently gives the active substance of

amorphous form. Since the finished product needs to be reconstituted prior to administration as

solution for infusion, polymorphism is not considered a critical aspect for finished product performance.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 7/16


-----

There is a monograph of tigecycline in the European Pharmacopoeia and the active substance

specifications comply with the Ph. Eur.; however, the manufacturer of the active substance has not

provided a CEP for the active substance.

***Manufacture, characterisation and process controls***

The active substance is obtained from a single supplier. Initially it was proposed to source the active

substance from two different sources, however one of the proposed sources was withdrawn during the

procedure. Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the

restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

The active substance is synthesised in six main steps using well defined starting materials with

acceptable specifications.

During the procedure, the CHMP requested additional information regarding the justification of the

chosen starting material. Following the provided justifications, the initially proposed starting material

was accepted.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods

for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline

on chemistry of new active substances.

Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

Primary packaging complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

***Specification***

The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.),

identification (IR), water content (KF), pH (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances

(HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), microbial examination

(Ph. Eur.), and genotoxic impurities (GC-MS).

The provided specification complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph for tigecycline. The following

parameters are tested additionally to those referenced in Ph. Eur.: residual solvents, bacterial

endotoxins, microbiological quality (the proposed limits are in-line with Ph. Eur. 5.1.4) and genotoxic

impurities.

Ph. Eur. impurities A, B and C are specified with limits that comply with the limits referenced in the Ph.

Eur. monograph for Tigecycline (2825). Ph. Eur. impurity D is controlled as unspecified impurity, again

in-line with Ph. Eur. monograph 2825.

A discussion of genotoxic impurities according to ICH M7 was presented and found acceptable.

Nitrosamines N-nitroso dimethyl amine and N-nitroso diethyl amine have been identified as potentially

formed impurities of the active substance. Confirmatory testing on three production scale batches

using appropriately validated and sensitive methods has shown that no nitrosamines were detected.

The applied method is considered capable to guarantee sufficiently low levels of nitrosamines, which

are routinely tested in active substance specifications.

Batch data demonstrating absence of heavy metal catalyst residues in the active substance have been

provided.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods

appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the

reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 8/16


-----

Batch analysis data on three consecutive commercial scale batches of the active substance are

provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

***Stability***

Stability data from six batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the

intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (2°C - 8°C) and from six

batches for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25°C ± 2°C / 60% ± 5% RH) according to

the ICH guidelines were provided. All tested parameters were within the specifications.

The following parameters were tested *:* description, water content, pH, specific optical rotation, related

substances and assay. Stability testing has been performed using USP methods. Equivalence data for

batches tested using USP and Ph. Eur. methods are presented and are considered acceptable and

comparable irrespective of whether testing was performed according to USP or Ph. Eur. This supports

the conclusion that stability data derived from testing using USP methods are representative for testing

according to Ph. Eur. monograph.

Results on stressed conditions: oxidation, alkaline medium, acidic medium, 60°C temperature, 30°C

temperature and 75% RH and exposure to UV light were also provided on one batch.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is

sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored in an airtight

container and protected from light.
#### **2.2.3. Finished medicinal product **

***Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development***

The finished product is presented as powder for solution for infusion containing 50 mg of tigecycline,

maltose monohydrate, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH

adjustment). After reconstitution, 1 ml contains 10 mg of tigecycline. Detailed composition of the

finished product is provided in Table 2. The medicinal product is supplied in vials as a sterile lyophilized

powder or cake.

The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable generic of the reference medicinal

product (RMP) Tygacil. The proposed product has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in

terms of active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as the RMP. Maltose monohydrate is

used in the proposed formulation instead of lactose monohydrate in the RMP, which is sufficiently

justified. The excipient maltose monohydrate is used in place of lactose monohydrate used in the RMP

as both are having similar physical properties. Maltose monohydrate and lactose monohydrate both are

disaccharide carbohydrates. Based on provided references, maltose is generally well tolerated, and it

has no clinically significant interactions with other drugs. Based on the provided discussion it is

concluded that metabolic and disposition pathway of tigecycline and maltose is sufficiently different

rendering interference of maltose not likely.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with compendial

monographs. The given specifications are considered justified and adequate. No description and

validation of method is required. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product

formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this

report.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 9/16


-----

Similarity to the RMP is shown by the Applicant in terms of composition, impurity parameters, X-ray

diffractogram, pH and osmolality (on reconstituted and diluted product), and other chemical

parameters.

The proposed overfill in order to achieve the same final concentration of the generic- and the RMP is

fully acceptable and the parameters, which might affect the physicochemical properties of the finished

product, have been sufficiently discussed.

Manufacturing process development is covered by 13 studies and compatibility studies are provided.

The sterilisation method is fully justified following the relevant guidance. Bulk holding time has been

justified.

Compatibility, reconstitution and dilution stability studies were performed. During the procedure the

CHMP requested that more information is provided regarding the in-use stability data. Following the

submission of requested information, the in-use stability as described in the SmPC has been found

acceptable. A stability of diluted solutions for 24 hours at 20-25°C and 48 hours at 2-8°C and of

reconstituted product for 6 h at 20-25°C is acceptable.

The primary packaging is a clear glass vial stoppered with rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminium

flip-off seal. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure

system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The

provided leachable study was considered acceptable. Microbiological attributes are sufficiently covered

for development.

During the procedure, the risk of formation of nitrosamine impurities was addressed for the active

substance. It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine

impurities is performed also for the Tigecycline Accord finished product within six months of the

marketing authorisation. In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of

the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive

methods within a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If

nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented.

***Manufacture of the product and process controls***

The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: manufacturing of the bulk solution, pre-filtration,

vial preparation (washing/depyrogenation), rubber stopper preparation (sterilisation), aluminium seal

preparation (sterilisation), filling equipment preparation (sterilisation), filling and half stoppering,

lyophilisation and sealing, and finally inspection, labelling and packaging. The process is considered to

be a non-standard manufacturing process.

Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three

commercial scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of

producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are

adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

***Product specification***

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form:

description (in-house), identification (HPLC, UV), reconstitution time (in-house), pH of the reconstituted

solution (Ph. Eur.), clarity of reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.), colour of reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.),

visible particles of reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.), water (KF), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.),

organic impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), particulate contamination (sub-visible) (Ph. Eur.), bacterial

endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.).

EMA/140293/2020 Page 10/16


-----

Specification parameters are considered appropriate for the dosage form. The finished product is

released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional final product release

testing.

For impurities, an identification and qualification threshold of ≤ 0.2% is applied. A discussion of the

chosen limit of bacterial endotoxins in the context of the applied administration is provided and

considered acceptable.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on the

control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in

accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used

for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the

manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

***Stability of the product***

Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long

term conditions (25°C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH)

according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those

proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested for: description, reconstitution time, pH of the reconstituted solution, clarity of

reconstituted solution, colour of reconstituted solution, visible particles of reconstituted solution, water,

organic impurities, assay, particulate contamination, bacterial endotoxins, and sterility. The analytical

procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed and results were

found to comply with the specification limits at the applicable time points throughout the duration of the

studies.

In accordance with EU GMP guidelines, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative

trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of

New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is not photosensitive.

Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution has been demonstrated for 6 hours

at 20 - 25°C, for the diluted solution for 24 hours at 20 - 25°C and for 48 hours at 2 - 8°C. From a

microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use

storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not be longer

than the times stated above for the chemical and physical in-use stability.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3)

are acceptable.

***Adventitious agents***

No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
#### **2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects **

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has

been presented in a satisfactory manner.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 11/16


-----

The assessment on nitrosoamine impurities in active substance is adequately described in dossier.

Nitrosamines N-nitroso dimethyl amine and N-nitroso diethyl amine have been identified as potentially

formed impurities of the active substance. Confirmatory testing on three production scale batches

using appropriately validated and sensitive methods has shown that no nitrosamines were detected.

The applied method is considered capable to guarantee sufficiently low levels of nitrosamines, which

are routinely tested in active substance specifications. It is recommended that an updated risk

evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities is performed also for the Tigecycline

Accord finished product within six months of the marketing authorisation.

The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality

characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and

uniform performance in clinical use.
#### **2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions

defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical

performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. **2.2.6. Recommendation for future quality development **

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress,

the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:

It is recommended that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities

in Tigecycline Accord finished product is conducted within six months of the marketing authorisation. In

the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation,

confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within a

year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine

impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided,

which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no

need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The

non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity

profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. **2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the

introduction of Tigecycline Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to

result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all tigecycline containing products

and the exposure of the environment to the active substance.

EMA/140293/2020 Page 12/16


-----

#### **2.3.3. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are acceptable and in line with the reference product. The

grounds for not providing new non-clinical data are adequately justified. The non-clinical overview on

pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology submitted by the applicant for Tigecycline Accord 50

mg powder for solution for infusion is considered sufficient and the ERA is acceptable. ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction **

This is a centralised Marketing Authorisation Application under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC

for Tigecycline Accord 50 mg powder for solution for infusion, in the following indication:

*Tigecycline Accord is indicated in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the treatment of*

*the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1):*

*• Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections (see*

*section 4.4);*

*• Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI).*

*Tigecycline Accord should be used only in situations where other alternative antibiotics are not suitable*

*(see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1).*

The reference product is Tygacil by Pfizer Limited, UK, authorised in EU since 2006. The Guideline on

the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1) is relevant for the assessment.

No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product. ***Exemption ***

This medicinal product is a parenteral preparation; therefore, a bioequivalence study is not required

according to appendix II of the current Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence

(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1).

Additionally, Tigecycline Accord contains the same active substance and applies for the same

indications, pharmaceutical form, route of administration, and the same strength as the reference

product Tygacil. The composition of Tigecycline Accord is the same as that of Tygacil with the

exception that lactose is substituted with maltose in the proposed product. Changes in inactive

ingredients (excipients) can be acceptable if it can be substantiated that these differences will not

affect the *in vivo* behaviour of the proposed drug product. The applicant submitted a justification

arguing that the difference in excipients will not affect the efficacy of the active substance. This is

accepted as a satisfactory justification and no further studies are required. **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

No bioequivalence study was submitted to support this Marketing Authorisation Application and no

such study is required according to appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence

as the test product is to be administrated as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same

active substance as the reference product. The test product contains the same excipients as the

reference product except for the substitution of lactose monohydrate for maltose monohydrate.

#### ***Conclusion ***

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. ***2.6. Pharmacovigilance *** ***Pharmacovigilance system ***

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. ***Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements ***

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set

out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. ***2.7. Product information *** **2.7.1. User consultation **

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the

basis of a bridging report making reference to Tygacil. The bridging report submitted by the applicant

has been found acceptable.
## **3. Benefit-risk balance **

This application concerns a generic version of tigecycline powder for solution for infusion. The

reference product Tygacil is indicated in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the

treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections, and

of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), in situations where other alternative antibiotics are

not suitable.

The product is a parenteral preparation and therefore, according to appendix II of the current

Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1), a bioequivalence

study is not required. From a non-clinical and clinical point of view, the application is approvable.

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to that of the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen

reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are

required beyond those included in the product information. **4. Recommendation **

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

that the benefit-risk balance of Tigecycline Accord is favourable in adults and in children from the age

of eight years for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding

diabetic foot infection, and of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), in situations where other

alternative antibiotics are not suitable.

The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

conditions:
