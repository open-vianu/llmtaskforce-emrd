### **1. Background information on the procedure **
##### ***1.1. Submission of the dossier ***

The applicant Pfizer Limited submitted on 21 July 2016 an application for a marketing authorisation to the

European Medicines Agency (EMA) for LIFMIOR, through the centralised procedure under Article 3 (3) of

Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 – ‘Generic of a Centrally authorised product’. The eligibility to the centralised

procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 28 January 2016.

The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

refers to a reference product for which a marketing authorisation is or has been granted in the Union on the

basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The applicant applied for the following indication:

Rheumatoid arthritis

LIFMIOR in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.

LIFMIOR can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment
with methotrexate is inappropriate.

LIFMIOR is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not
previously treated with methotrexate.

LIFMIOR, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of
joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and
adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant
of, methotrexate.

Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.

LIFMIOR has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years.

Psoriatic arthritis

Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. LIFMIOR has been shown to improve physical
function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage
as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease.

Axial spondyloarthritis

Assessment report
EMA/114647/2017 Page 4/19


-----

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to
conventional therapy.

Non - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation
as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who
have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Plaque psoriasis

Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or
psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1).

Paediatric plaque psoriasis

Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are
inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.

**The legal basis for this application refers to:**

Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC).

The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data with the

reference medicinal product Enbrel instead of non-clinical and clinical unless justified otherwise.

***Information on paediatric requirements***

Not applicable

***Similarity***

Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No

847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to

the proposed indication.

This application is submitted as a multiple of Enbrel authorised on 03 February 2000 in accordance with

Article 82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

### **2. Scientific discussion **
##### ***2.1. Introduction ***

Lifmior is an identical product to Enbrel, which has been authorised in the EU since 3 February 2000. The

applicant, Pfizer Limited, is also the current MAH for Enbrel. Lifmior is stated to be identical to Enbrel in all

but invented name and packaging.

Lifmior has all of the therapeutic indications for which Enbrel is currently approved, including treatment of:

  - Moderate-to-severe active RA in adults

  Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and

adolescents from the age of 2 years

  PsA in adolescents from the age of 12 years

  Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) in adolescents from the age of 12 years

  Active and progressive PsA in adults

  - Severe active AS in adults

  Severe nr-AxSpA in adults

  Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults

  Chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years.

Lifmior will have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well

as same pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths (for the 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for

injection for paediatric use, 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, 25 mg and 50 mg pre-filled

syringe and 50 mg pre-filled pen presentations) as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in

the manufacturing process, manufacturers, or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for

Lifmior that could lead to differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel.

Etanercept belongs to the pharmacologic class of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors and is a

bioengineered fusion protein incorporating 2 molecules of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p75

and the crystallizable fragment (Fc) component of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). This human recombinant

product binds specifically to TNF-α and lymphotoxin alpha, inhibiting their interaction with cell surface

receptors.

The Applicant claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etanercept), and cross-reference

is made to information submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of this application.

No new data are therefore required for this application and none have been submitted.

Assessment report
EMA/114647/2017 Page 7/19


-----

##### ***2.2. Quality aspects *** **2.2.1. Introduction **

Lifmior and Enbrel (reference product) are identical products. Lifmior is intended to have the same qualitative

and quantitative composition in active substance and excipients as well as the same pharmaceutical forms

and dose strengths as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in the manufacturing process,

manufacturers or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for Lifmior that could lead to

differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel. Lifmior will, in all respects, except for the invented name

and packaging, be identical to the reference product Enbrel. **2.2.2. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects **

The quality data in support of the Lifmior application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Enbrel

dossier. All the quality data have been assessed for the Enbrel application and adequately reflected in the

Product Information. ***2.3. Non-clinical aspects *** **2.3.1. Introduction **

The applicant already manufactures the same drug substance and drug product: the only difference is that

this product will be branded Lifmior, whereas the approved product is branded Enbrel. Lifmior is intended to

have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well as same

pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths as the reference product, Enbrel.

The applicant has supplied a short non-clinical overview which establishes that, given this situation, no new

nonclinical information is required.

The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. **2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment **

Etanercept is a human tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 FC fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA

technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. In accordance with the CHMP

guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP44447/00 entitled *“Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal*

*Products for Human Use”* ; proteins are exempted of ERA because they are unlikely to result in a significant

risk to the environment. Therefore, no environmental risk assessment was provided. This was considered

acceptable by CHMP.

EMA/114647/2017 Page 8/19


-----

##### **2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects **

As the active substance in Lifmior is the same as in Enbrel, there is no requirement for the applicant to

present data from non-clinical studies. **2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects **

The application is considered acceptable regarding the non-clinical aspects. ***2.4. Clinical aspects *** **2.4.1. Introduction **

This application claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etanercept), and cross-reference

is made to information submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of the clinical

pharmacology, efficacy and safety of Lifmior.

No new clinical data are therefore required and none have been submitted. **2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics **

No new clinical pharmacology data are required for this application and none have been submitted. **2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics **

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. **2.4.4. Post marketing experience **

Cumulatively through 02 February 2016, it is estimated that 11,787 subjects have been exposed to

etanercept (as Enbrel) either as monotherapy or in combination with comparators in Pfizer-sponsored clinical

trials, and an additional 13,366 subjects have been exposed to etanercept (as Enbrel) either as monotherapy

or in combination with comparators in Amgen-sponsored clinical trials.

The overall safety profile of etanercept (as Enbrel) after more than 16 years of commercial experience in the

EU continues to be favourable. This is supported by the most recent etanercept PSUR with no new significant

safety concerns identified during the respective time interval. **2.4.5. Discussion on clinical aspects **

Etanercept is a widely used and well known active substance. Lifmior will be a duplicate authorisation for

Enbrel and will therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel.

It has been outlined that in clinical use Lifmior may be considered interchangeable with Enbrel. This is

acknowledged by CHMP considering that Lifmior is identical to Enbrel. In a broader context there is however

the issue of educating health care professionals, particularly pharmacists, that Lifmior and Enbrel are

Assessment report
EMA/114647/2017 Page 9/19


-----

identical bearing in mind that automatic substitution for biologicals is currently not allowed in certain EU

countries. The applicants’ strategy to whether Lifmior is planned to be presented to be substitutable and

interchangeable for Enbrel remains unclear. In this respect it should be noted that introducing an identical

biological product bears the risk of adding a level of potential confusion to the existing state of education of

health care professionals with regard to the issue of interchangeability and substitution of biological medicinal

products, particularly biosimilars.
##### **2.4.6. Conclusions on clinical aspects **

The application is considered acceptable regarding the clinical aspects. ***2.5. Risk management plan ***

***Conclusion***

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 6.2 is acceptable.
##### ***2.6. PSUR submission ***

The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in

the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and

any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. ***2.7. Pharmacovigilance ***

***Pharmacovigilance system***

The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. ***2.8. Product information *** **2.8.1. User consultation **

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of

a bridging report making reference to Enbrel. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found

acceptable. **2.8.2. Additional monitoring **

Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lifmior (etanercept) is included in the additional

monitoring list as it is a biological product to be authorised after 1 January 2011.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this

medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety

information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
### **3. Benefit-risk balance **

The application contains no new quality, non-clinical and clinical data. Lifmior will except for the invented

name and commercial packaging, in all respects, be identical to the reference product Enbrel and will

therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel.

Assessment report
EMA/114647/2017 Page 16/19


-----

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference

medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those

### **4. Recommendation **

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the

benefit-risk balance of LIFMIOR is favourable in the following indication:

“ Rheumatoid arthritis

Lifmior in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active

rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including

methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.

Lifmior can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued

treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate.

Lifmior is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in

adults not previously treated with methotrexate.

Lifmior, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression

of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in

children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who

have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate

response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.

Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an

inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy.

Lifmior has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years.

Psoriatic arthritis

Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous

disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Lifmior has been shown to

improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of

peripheral joint damage as measured by X ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of

the disease.

Axial spondyloarthritis

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response

to conventional therapy.

-----

Non    - radiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of

inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging

(MRI) evidence, who have had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

(NSAIDs).

Plaque psoriasis

Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a

contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or

psoralen and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1).

Paediatric plaque psoriasis

Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who

are inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies.”
