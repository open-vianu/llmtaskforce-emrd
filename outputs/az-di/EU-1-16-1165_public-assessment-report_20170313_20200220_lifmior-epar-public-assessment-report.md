2. Scientific discussion

2.1. Introduction

Lifmior is an identical product to Enbrel, which has been authorised in the EU since 3 February 2000. The applicant, Pfizer Limited, is also the current MAH for Enbrel. Lifmior is stated to be identical to Enbrel in but invented name and packaging.

Lifmior has all of the therapeutic indications for which Enbrel is currently approved, including tre

ent of:

- Moderate-to-severe active RA in adults

- Polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthrite in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years

longer authorised

- PsA in adolescents from the age of 12 years

- Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) in adolescents from the age of 11

- Active and progressive PsA in adults

- Severe active AS in adults

- Severe nr-AxSpA in adults

- Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults

- Chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years.

Lifmior will have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well as same pharmaceutical forms and dose strengths (for the 10 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection for paediatric use, 25 mg powder and solvent for solution for injection, 25 mg and 50 mg pre-filled syringe and 50 mg pre-filled pen presentations) as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in the manufacturing process, manufacturers, or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for Lifmior that could lead to differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel.

Etanercept belongs to the pharmacologic class of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors and is a bioengineered fusion prowin incorporating 2 molecules of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) p75 and the crystallizable fragment (Fc) component of immunoglobulin G1 (lgG1). This human recombinant product binds specifically to TNF-a and lymphotoxin alpha, inhibiting their interaction with cell surface receptors.

The Applicant claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etanercept), and cross-reference is made to formation submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of this application.

Me

data are therefore required for this application and none have been submitted.

2.2. Quality aspects

2.2.1. Introduction

Lifmior and Enbrel (reference product) are identical products. Lifmior is intended to have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and excipients as well as the same pharmaceutical form and dose strengths as the reference product, Enbrel. There are no changes in the manufacturing process manufacturers or manufacturing sites, and container closure components for Lifmior that could lead t differences in safety or efficacy compared to Enbrel. Lifmior will, in all respects, except for the invented name and packaging, be identical to the reference product Enbrel.

The applicant already manufactures the same oug substance and drug product: the only difference is that this product will be branded Lifmior, whereas the approved product is branded Enbrel. Lifmior is intended to have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in drug substance and excipients as well as same pharmaceutical forms and dose strenges the reference product, Enbrel.

The applicant has supplied a short non-clinical overview which establishes that, given this situation, no new nonclinical information is required.

2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

Etanerce ti a human tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 FC fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. In accordance with the CHMP EMEA/CHMP/SWP44447/00 entitled "Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use"; proteins are exempted of ERA because they are unlikely to result in a significant Wrisk to the environment. Therefore, no environmental risk assessment was provided. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.

2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

As the active substance in Lifmior is the same as in Enbrel, there is no requirement for the applicant to present data from non-clinical studies.

2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

The application is considered acceptable regarding the non-clinical aspects.

2.4.1. Introduction

This application claims similarity to the originator/reference product, Enbrel (etane cept), and cross-reference is made to information submitted by the MAH for the originator product in support of the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of Lifmior.

Discussion on clinical aspects

Eldnercept is a widely used and well known active substance. Lifmior will be a duplicate authorisation for Enbrel and will therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel.

It has been outlined that in clinical use Lifmior may be considered interchangeable with Enbrel. This is acknowledged by CHMP considering that Lifmior is identical to Enbrel. In a broader context there is however the issue of educating health care professionals, particularly pharmacists, that Lifmior and Enbrel are

Assessment report EMA/114647/2017

Page 9/19

identical bearing in mind that automatic substitution for biologicals is currently not allowed in certain EU countries. The applicants' strategy to whether Lifmior is planned to be presented to be substitutable and interchangeable for Enbrel remains unclear. In this respect it should be noted that introducing an identical biological product bears the risk of adding a level of potential confusion to the existing state of education of health care professionals with regard to the issue of interchangeability and substitution of biological medicina products, particularly biosimilars.

2.8. Product information

2.8.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Enbrel. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

2.8.2. Additional monkoring

Pursuant to Article of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lifmior (etanercept) is included in the additional monitoring list &s is a biological product to be authorised after 1 January 2011.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

Benefit-risk balance

The application contains no new quality, non-clinical and clinical data. Lifmior will except for the invented name and commercial packaging, in all respects, be identical to the reference product Enbrel and will therefore have exactly the same therapeutic efficacy and safety profile as Enbrel.

Assessment report EMA/114647/2017

Page 16/19

A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensas that the benefit-risk balance of LIFMIOR is favourable in the following indication:
