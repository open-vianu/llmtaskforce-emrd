2. Scientific discussion
2.1. Problem statement
2.1.1. Disease or condition
Voraxaze is indicated to reduce toxic plasma methotrexate concentration in adults and children (aged
28 days and older) with delayed methotrexate elimination or at risk of methotrexate toxicity.
2.1.2. Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention
Methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent that has been used for the treatment of malignancies in paediatric
and adult patients since the 1950s (Bleyer, 1978). Methotrexate exerts its effect by competitively
inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the intracellular enzyme responsible for converting folic acid
to reduced folate cofactors, which are necessary for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (Hagner
and Joerger, 2010).
Methotrexate is used alone or as part of a combined chemotherapy regimen, either in standard or high
doses. High-dose MTX (HDMTX) (defined as both >1 g/m2 (Hagner and Joerger, 2010), or ≥500
mg/m2 (Kitchlu et al., 2019)) is included in the recommended treatment regimens for a number of
malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and osteosarcoma (ESMO Clinical Guidelines;
Vitolo et al., 2015, Tilly et al., 2016, Hoelzer et al., 2016 and Casali et al., 2018).
HDMTX administration is always accompanied by vigorous intravenous (IV) hydration and alkalinisation
of the urine (Howard et al., 2016). If this proves inadequate, as the urinary concentration of MTX rises
and the urinary pH decreases, the solubility of MTX is exceeded (Abelson et al., 1983). At a urinary pH
of <7, MTX begins to precipitate in the renal tubules and renal dysfunction ensues; this has been
termed MTX-induced crystal nephropathy (Condit et al., 1969; Perazella, 1999; Perazella and Moeckel,
2010). Methotrexate elimination may also be delayed by co-administration of anti-inflammatory drugs,
proton pump inhibitors, and certain antibiotics (Santucci et al., 2010). The renal damage induced by
MTX reduces its clearance, thereby increasing the duration and magnitude of exposure to circulating
MTX (Sand and Jacobsen, 1981). The clinical manifestations of MTX toxicity may include
myelosuppression, gastrointestinal distress, hepatic injury, mucocutaneous toxicity, neurotoxicity,
pulmonary toxicity and acute kidney injury (Pannu, 2019).
2.1.3. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis
Measures that are routinely employed to reduce MTX toxicity also include the administration of leucovorin
(Ramsey 2018), which may require dose escalation (Ahmed et al., 2013). Leucovorin, provided as an
exogenous source of tetrahydrofolate to replace the intracellular pool inhibited by MTX, does not reduce
the amount of circulating MTX and when MTX concentrations remain high, toxicity may still occur because
leucovorin cannot compete effectively with MTX for transport into cells (Pinedo et al., 1976).
The expected plasma MTX concentrations at various time points after HDMTX infusion have been
published (Ramsey, 2018). When MTX elimination is delayed, the continued circulation of high
concentrations of the drug exposes multiple organ systems to its toxic effects (Chabner and Young,
1973). The risk factors for developing MTX-associated toxicity include a history of renal dysfunction,
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/751047/2021
volume depletion, acidic urine and drug interactions (Howard et al., 2016) and potentially
pharmacogenetics (Campbell et al., 2016). Fatal MTX toxicity is usually due to severe
myelosuppression with sepsis or haemorrhage, or renal failure (Von Hoff et al., 1977).
Prolonged exposure to MTX and high systemic MTX concentrations appear to be the primary factors
that determine the extent of tissue damage produced by MTX, and are associated with serious
toxicities, poorer clinical outcomes, and higher incidence of death (Nirenberg et al., 1977). The
threshold systemic MTX concentrations above which serious toxicities are likely to develop are reported
to be 5 to 10 umol/L at 24 hours, >1 umol/L at 48 hours, and >0.1 umol/L at 72 hours following MTX
administration (Widemann and Adamson, 2006).
Methotrexate-induced renal impairment is a medical emergency that continues to occur even with the
best medical management. In a literature review of patients with osteogenic sarcoma who received
HDMTX, the reported incidence of renal toxicity in the reported studies ranged from 0-12.4%. When
combined with additional data from the authors' patient series, 68 of 3887 patients (1.8%) developed
Grade ≥2 nephrotoxicity and three deaths were attributable to MTX toxicity (Widemann et al., 2004a).
This series included only patients treated after 1980, when management routinely included IV
hydration, urinary alkalinisation and leucovorin rescue. In a retrospective study of 649 cycles of
HDMTX in 194 patients, renal toxicity occurred in 9.1% of cycles in patients with lymphoma compared
to 1.5% in patients with sarcoma (May et al., 2014). Another retrospective study analysed 432 cycles
of HDMTX in 140 patients with leukaemia or lymphoma of which 38.6% experienced nephrotoxicity of
any grade, the majority being grade 1 serum creatinine increases (Wiczer et al., 2016).
In children with ALL, it was reported that 0.5% were at risk of developing delayed methotrexate
elimination, and in a population of 1,286 patients, 3.6% received glucarpidase (Svahn et al., 2017).
Renal impairment occurs much more frequently in older patients; in a series of 23 patients (19 to 94
years of age) receiving HDMTX for PCNSL, 48% experienced a doubling of serum creatinine (sCr)
during treatment, and nine patients met the criteria for administration of glucarpidase under the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol with respect to presence of toxic MTX concentrations and renal
impairment (Green et al., 2006; Green and Chamberlain, 2009).
2.1.4. Management
Extracorporeal methods such as haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration, high-flux haemodialysis, charcoal
haemoperfusion or haemofiltration, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusion or plasma exchange are
treatment options for patients with toxic MTX concentrations due to renal impairment. The results of
these methods are mixed (reviewed by Widemann et al., 2004a; Vilay et al., 2010; King et al., 2019).
High-flux haemodialysis is the most effective method of extracorporeal MTX removal, but requires five
to six days of daily treatments (4-6 hours per session) (Wall et al., 1996). The risks associated with
repeated haemodialysis, especially in a thrombocytopenia patient, are significant (Kitchlu et al., 2019).
There is a clear, medical need for rapid, safe means of reducing toxic MTX concentrations in patients
with renal impairment that is met by glucarpidase, approved in the US since January 2012 (Rattu et al
2013). When administered via IV route to patients with toxic MTX concentrations, glucarpidase rapidly
hydrolyses extracellular MTX and its active metabolite 7-OH MTX into the inactive metabolites
glutamate, DAMPA and 7-OH DAMPA, which are metabolised hepatically. The administration of
glucarpidase results in >95% reduction in plasma MTX concentration within 15 minutes of
administration, thereby profoundly decreasing both the magnitude and duration of exposure to
circulating MTX (Widemann et al 2010; Green 2012; Cada et al 2012; Widemann et al 2014; Cavone et
al 2014; Svahn et al 2017; Ramsey et al 2018). Such a rapid efficacy with a single non-invasive dose
offers advantages over other therapies such as haemodialysis and high-flux haemodialysis (King et al

EMA/CHMP/751047/2021

The stability studies results showed that glucarpidase is susceptible to a certain degree of change at all
storage temperatures, being acceptable at the proposed storage temperature. The major changes are
seen in isoforms ratios with no impact on activity. Based on these results, the proposed shelf life for
the active substance when stored at the recommended storage conditions is considered acceptable.
Data from accelerated studies support short excursions from this storage temperature such as may
occur during storage, shipping and handling.
Forced degradation studies performed in glucarpidase active substance and Voraxaze finished product
demonstrated that the glucarpidase protein is susceptible to light, heat, base, acid, pyroglutamination
and Maillard degradation pathways and that no single method is suitable for detecting changes by all
the degradation pathways. These results have allowed the identification of stability indicating methods,
which have been included in the post-approval stability protocol.
Photostability studies are included as part of the forced degradation studies.
The post-approval stability protocol includes the methods identified as stability indicating in the forced
degradation studies. The proposed testing frequency has been justified and is acceptable.
In conclusion, the information provided in this section is sufficient.
2.4.3. Finished Medicinal Product
2.4.3.1. Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
Voraxaze finished product is supplied as a lyophilised powder solution for intravenous infusion in a
dosage strength of 1000 Units of glucarpidase as active substance. Other ingredients are lactose,
trometamol and zinc acetate dihydrate. Before use, the lyophilised finished product is reconstituted
with 1 mL of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution yielding a solution containing 1000 Units/mL.
The finished product is supplied in a 3 mL Type 1 glass vials with a bromobutyl stopper and standard
blue flip off seal. Each pack contain one vial.
Finished product qualitative and quantitative composition has been provided.
Pharmaceutical development
Glucarpidase is the only active ingredient in the Voraxaze finished product. The finished product
formulation is identical to the active substance formulation: 1000 # 100 Units of glucarpidase in a
Tris/HCl buffer, zinc acetate and lactose.
No overages are included in the formulation or filling of glucarpidase finished product.
The manufacture of Voraxaze finished product for clinical trials started in 1991 and three finished
product manufacturing facilities have been used since then. The final formulation has remained
unchanged since the first batch.
The finished product manufacturing process has almost not been modified since the first manufacturing
process described with the exception of a few changes to the lyophilisation cycle due to differences in
the lyophilisation equipment and differences in the facilities. The differences have been properly
described and justified. Comparability studies between the finished product batches manufactured at
different sites have been performed.
Different reports detailing the protocols, acceptance criteria and results from the comparability studies
between finished product batches manufactured at different manufacturing sites have been provided.
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/751047/2021
Comparability results indicate that the processes were comparable in quality attributes. The higher
differences were observed in the content of each isoform in the different finished product lots. As has
been described in the characterisation section of active substance, the different charge isoforms were
considered to be product related substances and have been defined as those variants that have
properties comparable to those of the desired product.
During the comparability study, finished product lots were exposed to degradation conditions and
samples were analysed after those treatments with some tests. The analytical results of the different
tests used when the finished product was exposed to these degradation conditions have been provided.
The container/closure system comprises a Type I neutral borosilicate glass vial, a bromo butyl
elastomeric stopper and an aluminium flip-off type cap. Suitability of the container has been
demonstrated through different studies including evaluation of the container integrity (dye leak testing
and microbial challenge testing) and compatibility with diluent. A comprehensive evaluation of the
manufacturer's leachable and extractable experimental studies has been completed as a full process
risk assessment.
2.4.3.2. Manufacture of the product and process controls
The finished product manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The manufacturing
process consists of glucarpidase active substance sterilisation, filling, lyophilisation, primary and
secondary packaging.
IPCs and CPPs and their acceptable limits are clearly defined. CPP, PP and IPACs were identified. The
information provided is sufficient.
Process Validation
The finished product manufacturing process has been adequately validated with several consecutive PV
batches. Several validation procedures have been successfully performed. Validation reports have been
provided. A shipping validation study for transport of Voraxaze finished product has also been
provided.
2.4.3.3. Product specification
Finished product specification covering relevant parameters, has been provided. The specification for
release and stability of glucarpidase finished product have been set in accordance with ICH Q6B and
covers most of the relevant characteristics of enzymes: appearance, pH, identity, purity and
impurities, potency and microbiological content.
The proposed specifications for finished product are considered adequate to ensure the quality of the
produced Voraxaze finished product batches.
The acceptance criteria have been established using release and stability data from several lots.
The specifications acceptance criteria have been adequately justified.
A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities in line with ICH Q3D has been included. It
can be concluded that the risk and the impact on patient safety associated with the presence of
elemental impurities is negligible. Specific control on elemental impurities are considered not needed.
This is agreed.

EMA/CHMP/751047/2021

exaggerated pharmacological effect of glucarpidase. Some of the effects might also have been due to
the immunogenicity of glucarpidase in the dog. This rationale was already discussed during the
previous submission. No new studies were conducted meanwhile to clarify the toxicity observed. This is
acceptable bearing in mind limitations of animal studies for this substance which is proposed to be
used under specific circumstances (emergency use due to methotrexate toxicity) as single dose
application and available clinical data.
Assessment of local tolerance, immunogenicity and toxicokinetics were incorporated into the repeat-
dose toxicology studies in lieu of completion of separate studies.
2.5.4.3. Genotoxicity
No studies for genotoxic potential have been conducted. This is adequate as per relevant guidelines
(ICH S6(R1), ICH S1A and ICH S9).
2.5.4.4. Carcinogenicity
No studies for carcinogenic potential have been conducted. This is adequate as per relevant guidelines
(ICH S6(R1), ICH S1A and ICH S9).
2.5.4.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity
No reproductive toxicology studies were completed for glucarpidase because 1) glucarpidase will be
administered to patients who have already been exposed to HDMTX, a known teratogen, 2)
glucarpidase will be used in a patient population with a serious and life-threatening illness with poor
prognosis, 3) appropriate labelling will indicate that glucarpidase should only be used when the
expected benefit is likely to outweigh the risk, 4) as indicated in the labelling, MTX is contraindicated in
pregnancy, and therefore glucarpidase administration to pregnant women should seldom be an issue
and 5) glucarpidase is a protein, and therefore it is unlikely that it will pose any more of a reproductive
toxicology risk than MTX. Glucarpidase could potentially be of benefit if it were given to a pregnant
woman with prolonged exposure to toxic concentrations of MTX as it would reduce this exposure.
2.5.4.6. Toxicokinetic data
Assessment of toxicokinetics were incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicology studies in lieu of
completion of separate studies. Toxicokinetic groups were included to both pivotal toxicology studies in
rats and dogs. In rats, measurements are however limited to only one sampling time 10 minutes post-
dose. The low dose (50 Units/kg) resulted in plasma concentrations of 0.4-0.5 Units/mL 10 minutes
post-dose. This compares to a Cmax of 1.5 Units/mL in humans receiving a single IV dose of
glucarpidase, also at 50 Units/kg. The high dosed (5000 Units/kg) rats presented with plasma
concentrations of 100-163 Units/mL. This is in the range of at least 100-fold greater than the human
Cmax (1.5 Units/mL) at a single IV dose of 50 Units/kg.
In dogs, quantifiable systemic exposure was found at all dose concentrations, and the systemic
exposure increased with increasing dose concentration with no gender differences. Tmax for enzyme
activity generally occurred at the first blood sampling time of 0.083 hours (5 minutes) post-dose in
most animals at all dose concentrations. The mean elimination t1/2 for glucarpidase was
approximately 5 hours, ranging from 4.3 to 4.6 hours at 500 Units/kg and 5.3 to 6.0 hours at 2500
Units/kg, similarly as in humans. Due to high mortality, no data are available allowing adequate
statistical analysis of the measured parameters.
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/751047/2021
2.5.4.7. Local Tolerance
Assessment of local tolerance was incorporated into the repeat-dose toxicology studies. There was no
local inflammatory response reported at the injection site in any of the treated rats up to 5000
Units/kg/day. In the dog study, there was no significant difference in the degree of inflammation at the
injection site between control and treated animals at doses up to 2500 Units/kg.
2.5.4.8. Other toxicity studies
No specific studies for anti-glucarpidase antibody response was conducted. The applicant refers to
published study from 1992 conducted in monkeys. The study suggested that the effectiveness of
glucarpidase in animals with high antibody titres was somewhat reduced.
Immunogenicity was examined in both the pilot and pivotal repeat-dose toxicology studies by the use
of an ELISA assay using Protein A as a secondary detection agent (IgG and IgM dog anti-glucarpidase
antibodies; however, in this assay, they were not distinguished.
Anti-glucarpidase antibodies were detected in both toxicology studies in the dog after repeated dosing.
However, correlation of antibody formation on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters,
incidence and/or severity of adverse effects, complement activation, or the emergence of new toxic
effects cannot be made due to limited number of survived animals.
Analytes from other species were not measured in toxicology studies for the presence of antibodies.
In general, the induction of antibody formation in animals is not predictive of a potential for antibody
formation in humans.
In rats, a single IV injection of the anti-foaming agent StruktolTM J673 at doses up to 0.1 mg/kg to
administered either alone or combined with Voraxaze (50 U/kg), was not associated with any in-life
signs of toxicity or pathological changes.
In monkeys, the safety and efficacy of glucarpidase administered by the intrathecal route after MTX
has been investigated. Even though reduction in measured CSF MTX concentrations were observed
within 15 minutes of Voraxaze administration in all animals a number of limitations in the use of the
model with significant inter-animal variability in CSF MTX levels and neurotoxicity precluded a
reasonably sized definitive study.
2.5.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Voraxaze has been performed in accordance with the
CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 and draft guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev. 1).
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or
distribution of the substance in the environment. In addition, glucarpidase PEC surface water value was
found to be below the action limit of 0.01 ug/L. Therefore, glucarpidase is not expected to pose a risk
to the environment.
2.5.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Glucarpidase is a recombinant bacterial enzyme that hydrolyses the carboxyl-terminal glutamate
residue from folic acid and structurally related molecules such as MTX. Glucarpidase converts MTX to
its inactive metabolites DAMPA and glutamate. Because both DAMPA and glutamate are metabolised by
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/751047/2021

by CV values consistently >100%. There was no apparent trend for CV values to increase or decrease
as a function of age.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
The active substance is an enzyme, and therefore no conventional in vitro PK DDI studies with
glucarpidase are deemed necessary. Although DAMPA is a minor metabolite of MTX in the absence of
glucarpidase, it is the major metabolite of MTX following administration of glucarpidase. The potential
for PK DDI of DAMPA was evaluated.
DAMPA is likely to induce CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. The risk for
other pharmacokinetic interactions with glucarpidase is expected to be low apart from the interaction
with leucovorin.
Leucovorin (LV)
Study (PR001-CLN-010) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2-period crossover PK
study of the effect of glucarpidase on leucovorin pharmacokinetics in healthy male subjects. Six
subjects were randomised and entered the study. All six subjects completed the study in accordance
with the protocol, protocol amendments and the treatment randomisation. An interval of at least 14
days separated each treatment period. In the first treatment period, 3 subjects received an IV infusion
of glucarpidase (50 U/kg) over 5 minutes and 3 subjects received an IV infusion of placebo; in the
second treatment period, each subject received the alternate treatment. In each study period, subjects
also received 5 IV injections of LV (150 mg/m2) at 6-hourly intervals (q6h), starting at 2 hr after the
glucarpidase or placebo infusion. Dosing occurred at similar times for both treatment periods,
commencing at 10:00 for glucarpidase or placebo and at 12:00, 18:00, 00:00, 06:00 and 12:00 for
LV. Blood samples for the analysis of LV (Dose 1 and Dose 5): pre-dose, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,
120, 180, 240, and 360 minutes post-LV dose. Blood samples for the analysis of glucarpidase were
collected pre-dose, 10 and 60 minutes, 2, 6, 14 and 26 hr after glucarpidase. An ELISA method was
used to measure total glucarpidase. The immune response to glucarpidase was not assessed in this
study.
The data from study PR001-CLN-010 showed that exposure to active L stereoisomer of LV is
significantly decreased in presence of glucarpidase. The exposure following first dose was reduced by
47% and following 5th dose (administered 26 h after glucarpidase administration) the exposure was
reduced by 22%. Maximal plasma levels were reduced as well by 10% and 32% respectively.

The levels of inactive (6) D/R-Leucovorin were not affected by co-administration of glucarpidase in the
study. As significant PK interaction between glucarpidase and leucovorin was shown in study PR001-
CLN-010, the clinical significance of this was further evaluated in Study PR001-CLN-017 in patients
treated with HDMTX.
Study PR001-CLN-017:
This was an open-label, non-randomized multicenter PK study in patients treated with HDMTX and LV.
It was designed to assess the PK profile of LV and its active metabolite in patients showing delayed
elimination of MTX in the presence of renal impairment who were treated with glucarpidase (Arm A).
Patients not requiring glucarpidase (that is, not showing delayed elimination of MTX and not renally
impaired) served as a reference arm (Arm B). Patients in both Arms A and B received HDMTX followed
by IV LV at doses as recommended in institutional tumour-specific treatment guidelines. Patients in
Arm A also received a single dose of glucarpidase 50 U/kg in a bolus injection over 5 minutes. The first
IV LV dose after glucarpidase for Arm A patients, and the first IV LV dose after MTX for Arm B patients
were designated as the reference LV doses. For Arm A, eligible patients required IV LV rescue therapy
with either >15 mg or >10 mg/m2 every 6 hours (q6h). The dose of LV was to be based upon the
preglucarpidase MTX concentration and maintained for at least 48 hours after dosing with glucarpidase.
It was recommended that the administration schedule for LV be adjusted so that it was not
administered within 2 to 4 hours prior to or 2 to 4 hours following glucarpidase. For Arm B, only
patients who required LV by the IV route at a dose of <25 mg/m2 were to be entered into the study.
Patients in both treatment arms were to continue to receive standard of care treatment including
supportive care such as hydration and alkalinisation of urine. Haemoperfusion/dialysis was to have
been instituted if so indicated, as appropriate general supportive care. Plasma blood samples for the

In patients with intrathecal MTX overdosage, immediate CSF removal was recommended, and
ventriculolumbar perfusion or continuous CSF drainage was to be considered. Additional alkalinisation
and LV rescue were to be instituted, and anticonvulsive and dexamethasone therapies were to be
considered.
Glucarpidase was supplied in a lyophilised form in vials that contained 1,000 units of glucarpidase. The
lyophilized product was reconstituted in isotonic saline prior to use.
All patients were treated with the same lot of glucarpidase: Lot 004.
Efficacy measurements:
The efficacy assessments used in this study were serum MTX concentrations measured by a central
laboratory using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay, and MTX and serum
creatinine concentrations measured by local laboratories.
MTX Concentration (Central Laboratory):
Blood samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by HPLC were taken by venipuncture at 0
minutes (ie, immediately before) and 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 4 hours after the first glucarpidase dose,
and every 24 hours thereafter until the MTX concentration dropped below 0.1 umol/L. Optional
samples could be taken at 30 minutes, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, and 8 hours after
glucarpidase dosing.
MTX Concentration (Local Laboratories):
Serum samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by local laboratories were collected and
analysed as clinically indicated and in accordance with GMALL guidelines.
Blood samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by HPLC were taken at 15 minutes, 30
minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8
days, 15 days, and 22 days after the first glucarpidase dose.
Serum Creatinine Concentrations:
Samples for determination of serum creatinine concentrations by a local laboratory were to be obtained
prior to MTX treatment, before glucarpidase treatment, and daily thereafter.
Urine Sampling:
Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected to determine the total amount of MTX inactivated by
glucarpidase. Collection was to continue until 2 consecutive serum MTX measurements, 24 hours
apart, were <0.1 umol/L.
Bioanalytical methods
Concentrations of MTX, OH-MTX and DAMPA were measured in human serum, plasma and urine by
validated HPLC methods in the central facilities (one in the USA and one in Germany). Both methods
were sufficiently sensitive, selective and provided reliable results. Stability studies were carried out at
It is facility where another HPLC methods with fluorescence detection were
developed for sample handling studies.
These sample handling studies () were carried out to investigate the potential for ex-vivo metabolism
of MTX by glucarpidase between time of sample collection and analysis. Their aim was to provide
assurance that reported MTX levels in patients following glucarpidase treatment accurately reflected
MTX levels in vivo at the time of blood draw. The effect of inactivation of glucarpidase with HCl was

EMA/CHMP/751047/2021
clearly demonstrated, acid effectively inactivates glucarpidase in samples. Acid cannot be added to
whole blood because it causes agglutination of the samples. There is thus inevitably a period between
taking the sample and adding the HCl in which ex vivo conversion could have occurred. The data from
all sample handling studies demonstrated that degradation of MTX even at high concentrations is
complete by 15 minutes of glucarpidase incubation or administration. No significant further conversion
of MTX to DAMPA can be detected after this time, regardless of how the samples are subsequently
handled, even in samples in which the enzyme is not inactivated with HCl. Degradation of MTX to
DAMPA and glutamate may continue in vitro after blood collection and before plasma acidification.
However, this in vitro contribution to MTX decline is insignificant. The primary efficacy endpoint of the
clinical studies was not significantly affected by in vitro degradation of MTX before analysis. The
outcome of these studies is considered applicable across all the bioanalytical methodologies utilized for
MTX.
Although concentrations of MTX, OH-MTX and DAMPA were measured in the clinical studies by accurate
and precise HPLC methods, routine clinical laboratories mostly use immunoassays to monitor MTX
levels in patients. However, after glucarpidase administration, the immunoassays significantly
overestimate plasma MTX concentrations because of assay interference from plasma DAMPA. The
extent of interference of DAMPA with immunochemistry assays of MTX determination and difference
from specific HPLC results was evaluated based on four efficacy studies. The applicant confirmed that
DAMPA half-life was about 9 hours. DAMPA is eliminated faster than MTX, the metabolism is involved in
DAMPA elimination and elimination is not dependent on renal clearance. The SmPC wording was
adjusted to contain clear instructions for practitioners how to proceed with monitoring of MTX levels
before and after 48 hours (5 t1/2 of DAMPA) and how to interpret the levels. The need of HPLC method
preference was emphasized. Leucovorin dosing will be still based upon pre-glucarpidase plasma MTX
concentrations for 48 hours after glucarpidase administration.
Besides
methods there was one more MTX method, HPLC/MS/MS developed
at
, UK to re-analyse samples from Arm A of the interaction study PR001-CLN-017.
Study 017 samples were previously assayed at
using an HPLC-F method however MTX
concentrations in patients receiving Voraxaze (Arm A) were considered anomalous. After their re-
analysis at
by HPLC/MS/MS concentrations of MTX were lower than values
determined by HLS method and comparable with previous clinical studies. Concentrations without
Voraxaze treatment (Arm B) were comparable with those analysed by HPLC-F method. All references
to the analytical phase are just for LC-MS/MS analysis in this Study 017.

Objectives
The protocol-defined objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glucarpidase in
patients with impaired MTX clearance due to MTX-induced renal failure following IV administration of
HDMTX therapy, or in patients with intrathecal MTX overdose.
•
Outcomes/endpoints
Primary efficacy endpoint:
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients who achieved a clinically important
reduction (CIR) in serum MTX concentration based on the central laboratory HPLC assay. A patient was
deemed to have achieved a CIR if the serum MTX concentrations in all samples obtained after the first
dose of glucarpidase were ≤1 umol/L.

nephrotoxicity and delayed MTX excretion. Requests for inclusion in the study were made to the NCI,
who supplied the protocol, glucarpidase and thymidine to the requesting institution.
Plasma MTX concentrations and renal function were monitored before and after the administration of
an IV dose of glucarpidase.
· Patients eligible to receive glucarpidase under protocol had a pre-treatment evaluation including
oncological diagnosis, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluations (haematology,
liver function tests, electrolytes and coagulation parameters), as well as assessment of renal function.
· Plasma samples for the determination of MTX and 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA)
concentrations by a central laboratory high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method were
to be obtained immediately prior to glucarpidase administration and at 15, 60, and 120 minutes
following glucarpidase dosing, and immediately prior to and 60 minutes following every subsequent
dose. Sampling strategy changed over the course of the study. Beginning July 1997, daily samples
were also to be collected; beginning April 2000, sample collection ceased; and beginning November
2003, sample collection was reinstated at 15 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours following each dose of
glucarpidase, and daily thereafter.
Plasma samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by local laboratories were collected and
analysed using the local institutions' routine assay methods. Samples for determination of sCr
concentrations by local laboratory were to be obtained prior to MTX treatment, before glucarpidase
treatment, and daily thereafter. Serum creatinine concentrations were categorized by Protherics
according to the NCI's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 based on age-
adjusted normal ranges.
· All patients remained hospitalized during the study.
. Study Treatments: Each patient was to receive glucarpidase 50 U/kg administered IV over 5 minutes.
The dosing strategies of glucarpidase changed during the course of the study. Dosing strategies
included 3 doses of glucarpidase at 4-hour intervals, 2 doses administered 24 hours apart, or
additional doses based on MTX plasma concentration. After February 2002, the maximum dose of
glucarpidase was capped at 2000 U. Following glucarpidase administration, patients were to continue
treatment with IV hydration, urinary alkalinisation, and LV.
· Thymidine was administered to all patients, per protocol, until July 1997 when the use of thymidine
was restricted to patients who received glucarpidase >96 hours after the start of MTX infusion. In
December 1997, thymidine was allowed only for patients suffering from severe MTX-related toxicity at
the time of study entry, and in November 2003, thymidine treatment was not allowed per the study
protocol.
Post-Glucarpidase Evaluations:
· Patients were to be closely monitored for adverse events (AE), which were to be documented in the
data collection form (DCF). Clinical chemistry, haematology and coagulation parameters were
monitored at designated time points.
· Blood samples for quantification of anti-glucarpidase antibodies (AGAs) were to be obtained
according to the initial protocol at 3, 7, and 14 days after glucarpidase administration. This
requirement was not included in the protocol amendment of October 2001; however, beginning
November 2001, samples were to be collected immediately prior to glucarpidase and approximately 7,
14, and 21 days following glucarpidase dosing.

Objectives
The overall objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of glucarpidase or a combination of
glucarpidase and thymidine in rescuing patients with delayed MTX elimination secondary to renal
dysfunction. Specific objectives of the study, as described in the original NCI protocol, were:
. To determine the utility of the combination of glucarpidase and LV with or without the addition of
thymidine in patients with delayed MTX excretion secondary to renal dysfunction;
· To study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MTX and MTX metabolites following glucarpidase rescue; and
. To evaluate the immune response to glucarpidase in patients treated with 1 or more doses of this
enzyme.
•
Outcomes/endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a clinically important reduction
(CIR) in plasma MTX concentration based on the central laboratory HPLC assay. The central laboratory
results were used to assess the primary efficacy endpoint because a metabolite of MTX, DAMPA,
interferes with local MTX assays following glucarpidase dosing. A patient was deemed to have achieved
a CIR if the plasma MTX concentrations in all samples obtained after the first dose of glucarpidase were
≤1 umol/L.
The primary endpoint, plasma MTX concentrations of ≤1 umol/L in all samples collected after the first
dose of glucarpidase, was retrospectively defined as a Clinically Important Reduction (CIR), after
discussions with the FDA.
The secondary efficacy endpoints included:
- The MTX concentration (central HPLC assay and by local assay) and percent change from baseline at
time points after the first glucarpidase dose;
- The proportion of patients who achieved a CIR (ie, all local laboratory MTX plasma concentrations
were ≤1 umol/L after the first dose of glucarpidase), and the proportion of patients with all local
laboratory MTX concentrations ≤1 umol/L more than 1 day postglucarpidase (ie, after excluding MTX
concentrations on the same calendar day as the first dose of glucarpidase) and more than 2 days post-
glucarpidase (ie, after excluding MTX concentrations on the same calendar day and the calendar day
after glucarpidase administration);
- Rebound of MTX concentrations (central HPLC assay), defined as patients who had MTX
concentrations that satisfied rebound criteria (ie, the post-glucarpidase MTX concentration at time tn
was >2 times the nadir post-glucarpidase MTX concentration prior to time tn, and the increase of MTX
concentration at time tn from the nadir prior to tn was >1 umol/L);

· Study Treatments: Each patient was to receive glucarpidase 50 U/kg administered intravenously (IV)
over 5 minutes. Patients who experienced greater than a 1 logarithmic decrease from baseline in
serum MTX concentrations following glucarpidase administration but who still had plasma MTX
concentrations > 1 umol/L could receive additional doses of glucarpidase with the approval of the
Principal Investigator. Patients were to continue to be treated with IV hydration, urinary alkalisation,
and leucovorin (LV).
. In order to avoid a potential interaction between LV and glucarpidase, LV administration was not to
be administered 4 hours prior to or 1 hour following administration of glucarpidase.
Post-Glucarpidase Evaluations:
. Renal function (urea and creatinine levels) was to be monitored daily for 1 week, and thereafter as
clinically indicated. In addition, a complete blood count with differential, platelet count, alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin were to be assessed at least
twice weekly for 3 weeks following glucarpidase administration.
· Patients were to be evaluated for glucarpidase-related adverse events. The World Health
Organization (WHO) toxicity scale was used to record the severity of the events and included the
following pre-defined areas: Allergy, Bilirubin, Cardiovascular (Clinical Status), Creatinine, Creatinine

Notes
There were 4 patients in the central MTX HPLC population who did not achieve a
CIR. All 4 of these patients achieved initial decreases in MTX concentration to ≤1
umol/L, but in 3 of these patients, MTX concentrations >1 umol/L were
subsequently measured 2 to 4 days following glucarpidase. In the fourth patient,
the initial MTX concentration post-glucarpidase was 1.0 umol/L, achieving greater
than a 99% reduction in MTX levels from a pre-glucarpidase MTX concentration of
165.86 umol/L. The next 3 MTX concentrations in this patient taken at 30 minutes,
60 minutes and 120 minutes post-glucarpidase, were >1 umol/L (1.05 umol/L,
1.49 umol/L and 3.62 umol/L, respectively) and thus the patient did not achieve a
CIR.

Association between Demographic/Baseline Characteristics and Subgroup Factors
Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients in the central MTX HPLC population were further
analysed by subgroup factors.
The following differences in demographic and baseline characteristics were observed:
· Approximately 76% of osteogenic sarcoma patients were <18 years of age, with no osteogenic
sarcoma patients aged ≥65 years, whereas all patients with PCNSL were
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/751047/2021
Page 111/162
· ≥18 years of age, with 42.9% of PCNSL patients aged ≥65 years. Most patients with ALL and
NHL were in the adult (>18 to <65 years) age group (55.2% and 62.5%, respectively);
· Among patients <12 years of age, the most frequent tumour was osteogenic sarcoma (10
patients) followed by ALL (5 patients). Among patients ≥65 years of age, the most frequent
tumour was PCNSL (6 patients) followed by NHL (4 patients);
· Most PCNSL, ALL, and NHL patients were male (100.0%, 81.8%, and 77.8%, respectively),
whereas most osteogenic sarcoma patients were female (55.1%);
· Osteogenic sarcoma patients received a much higher median dose of MTX (12.00 g/m2) than
patients with ALL, NHL or PCNSL (median doses ranged from 3.00 to 3.96 g/m2);
- As a consequence, patients with osteogenic sarcoma had substantially higher median
pre-glucarpidase MTX concentrations (76.65 umol/L) than patients with ALL, NHL or
PCNSL (median concentrations ranged from 4.60 to 5.75 umol/L) by the central HPLC
assay;
- Also, a higher percentage of osteogenic sarcoma patients received a second dose of
glucarpidase (37.0%) than did patients with NHL, ALL and PCNSL (15.0%, 13.3% and
7.1%, respectively). This was due to protocol design requirements in the individual
studies: generally patients in Studies 002 and 006 received a second dose of
glucarpidase if they had high baseline MTX concentrations, and patients in Studies 001
and 003 received additional doses if they had high MTX concentrations after
glucarpidase;
· A higher percentage of PCNSL and osteogenic sarcoma patients had moderate or severe (CrCl
<30 mL/minute) renal impairment (57.1% and 40.5%, respectively) than did patients with ALL
and NHL (31.0% and 21.6%, respectively). This is likely to be a consequence of the higher
proportion of elderly patients with PCNSL, and the higher pre-glucarpidase MTX concentrations
in patients with osteogenic sarcoma;
· A higher percentage of osteogenic sarcoma patients (26.1%) had hepatic impairment (bilirubin
>3 x ULN) than did patients with PCNSL, ALL and NHL (0.0%, 5.3%, and 16.7%, respectively).
This is likely to be a consequence of chemical hepatitis induced by the higher pre-glucarpidase
MTX concentrations in patients with osteogenic sarcoma;
· A higher percentage of PCNSL and NHL patients (35.7% and 28.2%, respectively) received
glucarpidase more than 4 days after MTX administration than did osteogenic sarcoma and ALL
patients (19.2% and 20.7%, respectively).
In summary, the differences in patient characteristics and baseline values described above are inter-
associated and result in the potentially unequal distribution of pre-glucarpidase MTX concentrations
among the different subsets of patients treated in the integrated efficacy studies. Examples of these
inter-associations include:
· Younger patients and female patients had higher pre-glucarpidase MTX concentrations due to
the larger proportion of osteogenic sarcoma disease in these groups, and the higher doses of
MTX administered;
· Patients who were treated with glucarpidase earlier were those who had higher pre-
glucarpidase MTX concentrations;
· Patients who received multiple doses of glucarpidase tended to have higher pre-glucarpidase
MTX concentrations, and therefore received the additional doses by protocol design;

Evaluation of MTX Concentration Reduction by Subgroups - Central MTX HPLC Assay
The percentage reduction from the baseline MTX concentration to the first post-glucarpidase MTX
concentration was also summarised by subgroup factors, and the results are discussed below. As for
the subgroup analysis of CIR, differences in percentage reduction in MTX concentrations between
subgroup factors, described below, are actually likely to be due to differences in baseline MTX
concentration between the subgroup factors.
Summaries and analyses of percentage MTX reduction by subgroup factors generally gave the same
conclusions for both for the central MTX HPLC and target populations.
MTX Concentration Reduction by Last Pre-glucarpidase MTX Concentration
An analysis of MTX concentration reduction by baseline MTX concentration showed that 97.8% of
patients (44 of 45 patients) in the central MTX HPLC population with a baseline MTX concentration ≥50
umol/L had at least a 95% initial reduction in MTX concentration, compared to 82.9% of patients (92
of 111 patients) with a baseline concentration <50 umol/L. Similarly, there was a reduction of at least
95% at the last measured MTX concentration in 97.8% of patients with a baseline MTX concentration
≥50 umol/L, compared to 71.2% of patients with a baseline concentration <50 umol/L . Therefore it
appears that patients with higher baseline MTX concentrations had higher percentage reductions in
MTX concentrations.
Figure 3.2.12.5. presents the percent reduction in MTX concentration from pre-glucarpidase MTX
concentrations to first post-glucarpidase MTX concentration, after a single dose of glucarpidase in the
central MTX HPLC population, with each symbol representing 1 patient. Regardless of the starting MTX
concentration, nearly all patients experienced a reduction in MTX concentration of at least 85%. Thus,
although a CIR was achieved in slightly more than half of all treated patients, and occurred mostly in
patients with MTX concentrations <50 umol/L, nearly all patients responded to glucarpidase with a
substantial percent reduction in MTX concentration, and this occurred regardless of the starting
concentration of MTX.

Patients with a baseline MTX concentration ≥50 umol/L were unlikely to achieve a CIR. However, in
these patients, the initial reduction in MTX concentration was at least 95% in all except 1 patient, and
the reduction at the last MTX concentration was at least 95% in approximately 98% of patients in the
central MTX HPLC population.
MTX Concentration Reduction by Tumour Type
The percentage of patients in the central MTX HPLC population who had at least a 95% initial reduction
in MTX concentration from baseline was greater for patients with osteogenic sarcoma (96.0%) than for
patients with ALL, NHL and PCNSL (82.8%, 83.8% and 84.6%, respectively).
There was a similar difference between tumour types when MTX reduction was assessed at the time of
the peak, nadir, and last concentrations.
MTX Concentration Reduction by Age Groups
The percentage of patients in the central MTX HPLC population who had at least a 95% initial reduction
in MTX concentration from baseline was slightly lower in patients in the ≥18 to <65 years age group
(85.1%) compared to patients in the younger and older age groups (90.6% to 93.3%). There was a
similar difference between age groups when MTX reduction was assessed at the time of the peak,
nadir, and last concentrations.
MTX Concentration Reduction by Interval between Start of MTX and First Dose of Glucarpidase
A subgroup analysis of MTX concentration reduction by the interval between the start of MTX dosing
and the first dose of glucarpidase suggested that patients treated later with glucarpidase (>4 days
after MTX) were less likely to have a ≥95% reduction, as assessed at first, peak, nadir and last
concentrations, compared to patients who were treated earlier. A ≥95% initial reduction in MTX
concentration was seen in 80.6% of patients in the central MTX HPLC population who received
glucarpidase >4 days after MTX, compared to 94.1%, 88.3% and 96.9% of patients who received
glucarpidase 2, 3 and 4 days after MTX, respectively. There was a similar difference between patients

To further assess renal function, the time course of sCr abnormalities and the effect of glucarpidase on
time to recovery of sCr values were explored. The time to recovery to CTC Grade 0, or to CTC Grade 1
or Grade 0 was evaluated in days after MTX IV dosing and in days after the first dose of glucarpidase.
Of 413 patients who developed sCr Grade 2 or higher post-MTX and who remained at Grade 1 or
higher at the pre- glucarpidase baseline (i.e., did not recover to Grade 0), 129 (31.2%) recovered to
Grade 0, with a median time to recovery of 19 days. Of 410 patients who developed Grade 2 or higher
sCr post- MTX and who remained at grade 2 or higher at the pre-glucarpidase baseline, 262 (63.9%)
recovered to Grade 0 or 1, with a median time to recovery of 12.5 days.
2.6.6. Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The applicant submitted data from 4 clinical studies which are considered as the main phase 3 studies
for efficacy analysis: PR001-CLN-001, PR001-CLN-002, PR001-CLN-003, PR001-CLN-006 to support
the efficacy of glucarpidase in the proposed indication of treatment of patients at risk of methotrexate
toxicity due to delayed methotrexate elimination.
Study PR001-CLN-001 was a prospective, open-label, non-randomised multicentre, compassionate-
use trial in patients with delayed MTX clearance after treatment with high-dose methotrexate
(HDMTX), or with intrathecal MTX overdose. Patients >18 years of age who were receiving HDMTX (>1
g/m2 body surface area given as an infusion over 24 hours) for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a solid tumour were eligible for participation in the
study if their serum MTX concentration was:
. >5 umol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion; or
· >1 umol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion together with renal insufficiency; or
. >0.4 umol/L 48 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion together with renal insufficiency.
All patients received at least a single dose of 50 U/kg glucarpidase administered as an IV injection over
a 5-minute period. Patients who had a serum MTX concentration greater than 0.1 umol/L 24 hours or
later after glucarpidase administration were permitted to receive an additional dose of glucarpidase 50
U/kg. Patients were required to have received high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) prior to glucarpidase
administration. Following glucarpidase administration, patients were to continue treatment with IV
hydration, adequate diuresis, urinary alkalinisation, and LV.
Plasma MTX concentrations and renal function were monitored before and after the administration of
an IV dose of glucarpidase. Patients eligible to receive glucarpidase under protocol had a pre-treatment
evaluation including oncological diagnosis, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
evaluations, as well as assessment of renal function.
Plasma samples for the determination of MTX and 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA)
concentrations by a central laboratory HPLC method were to be obtained immediately prior to
glucarpidase administration and at 15, 60, and 120 minutes following glucarpidase dosing. Blood
samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by HPLC were taken at 15 minutes, 30 minutes,
60 minutes, 120 minutes, 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 8 days, 15
days, and 22 days after the first glucarpidase dose.
The objectives of this study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glucarpidase in patients with
impaired MTX clearance due to MTX-induced renal failure following IV administration of HDMTX
therapy, or in patients with intrathecal MTX overdose.

Study PR001-CLN-002 was a prospective, open-label, non-randomised, multicenter, compassionate-
use trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of glucarpidase in patients experiencing HDMTX-induced
nephrotoxicity and delayed MTX excretion. Patients of any age were eligible for the study if they were
at risk of life-threatening toxicity following MTX administration secondary to delayed MTX elimination,
as defined by: plasma MTX concentration >10 umol/L >42 hours after the start of the MTX infusion; or
serum creatinine >1.5 times the ULN or CrCI ≤60 mL/m2/minute and delayed MTX excretion
documented by plasma MTX concentration measurements that were >2 SD above the mean at least
12 hours following MTX administration.
Plasma MTX concentrations and renal function were monitored before and after the administration of
an IV dose of glucarpidase. Patients eligible to receive glucarpidase under protocol had a pre-treatment
evaluation including oncological diagnosis, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
evaluations (haematology, liver function tests, electrolytes and coagulation parameters), as well as
assessment of renal function. Plasma samples for the determination of MTX and 4-deoxy-4-amino-
N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) concentrations by a central laboratory high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) method were to be obtained immediately prior to glucarpidase administration
and at 15, 60, and 120 minutes following glucarpidase dosing, and immediately prior to and 60
minutes following every subsequent dose. Sampling strategy changed over the course of the study.
Plasma samples for the determination of MTX concentrations by local laboratories were collected and
analyzed using the local institutions' routine assay methods. Samples for determination of sCr
concentrations by local laboratory were to be obtained prior to MTX treatment, before glucarpidase
treatment, and daily thereafter.
Each patient was to receive glucarpidase 50 U/kg administered IV over 5 minutes. The dosing
strategies of glucarpidase changed during the course of the study. Dosing strategies included 3 doses
of glucarpidase at 4-hour intervals, 2 doses administered 24 hours apart, or additional doses based on
MTX plasma concentration. After February 2002, the maximum dose of glucarpidase was capped at
2000 U. Following glucarpidase administration, patients were to continue treatment with IV hydration,
urinary alkalinisation, and LV.
The overall objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of glucarpidase or a combination
of glucarpidase and thymidine in rescuing patients with delayed MTX elimination secondary to renal
dysfunction.
Study PR001-CLN-003 was a prospective, open-label, nonrandomised, multicenter, compassionate-
use and emergency-use study in patients of any age experiencing delayed elimination of MTX in the
presence of renal impairment following administration of HDMTX.
Patients of any age, at risk of life-threatening toxicity following MTX administration, secondary to
delayed MTX excretion as defined below, were eligible for participation in the study:
Plasma MTX concentration (new venipuncture): >10 umol/L more than 36 hours, or >5 umol/L more
than 42 hours, or >3 umol/L more than 48 hours after the start of the infusion; and delayed MTX
excretion documented by serial plasma MTX levels (>2 SD above the mean) at least 12 hours after
MTX administration (Note: This criterion was included in the protocol but not reported in the published
manuscript.); and renal dysfunction as indicated by decreased diuresis; or serum creatinine >1.5 x
ULN and documented increase during the infusion period.
Plasma blood samples for the determination of MTX and 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid
(DAMPA) concentrations by central high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method were to
be obtained immediately prior to glucarpidase administration and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes
following glucarpidase dosing. Local assays were also to be obtained and analyzed as clinically
indicated.

2.6.8.3. Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Serious adverse events
Approximately one-third of patients in both populations experienced SAEs (153/489; 31.3%), most
commonly occurred in the Investigations (10%), Renal and urinary disorders (7%), and
Gastrointestinal disorders (6%) SOCs. The most common SAEs were renal disorder (6%), stomatitis
(4%) and neutrophil count abnormal (3%); all other events occurred in <2% of patients. As for TEAEs,
the most common SAEs are sequelae of HDMTX treatment or reflects the population studied.
For 57 patients, the relationship to glucarpidase was not recorded and is characterised as "unknown."
A few patients reported a treatment-related SAE: 9/489 (1.8%) in the Main Safety Population and
7/342 (7.0%) in the Target Population. At the PT level, each related SAE occurred in only one patient
(0.2%).
In the unpooled clinical studies of glucarpidase, an additional 20 patients experienced non-fatal SAEs.
The events experienced by these patients were mostly unrelated to glucarpidase.
The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in patients who received two doses of glucarpidase,
compared with those who received a single dose (35/105, 33.3% and 107/355, 30.1%, respectively).
Patients who received two doses of glucarpidase had a higher incidence, compared with patients who
received one dose, of SAEs in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC (difference 6.9%) and the SAE
renal disorder (difference 6.6%).
Analysis per Age Subgroups
Infants (>28 Day to <2 Years)
2 SAEs reported: histiocytosis haemopophagic (fatal outcome >30 days after the last glucarpidase
treatment), hypotension.
Four infants (4/6, 66.7%) experienced at least 1 Grade ≥3 event: 1 infant experienced events of
nausea, stomatitis and vomiting (each, 1/6, 16.7%); 1 infant experienced mucosal inflammation (1/6,

16.7%); 1 infant experienced histiocytosis haematophagic (1/6, 16.7%); and 1 infant experienced
hypotension (1/6, 16.7%).
Children (>2 to <12 Years) and Adolescents (>12 to <18 Years)
The overall incidence of SAEs was higher in children ≥2 to <12 years compared with adolescents ≥12
to <18 years (38/83, 45.8% versus 42/143, 29.4%) with a higher incidence of SAE nausea at PT level
(5/83, 6% vs. 0/143).
The overall incidence of >Grade 3 AEs was generally similar across the child and adolescent age
groups (66.3% versus 59.4%). Children ≥2 to <12 years compared with adolescents ≥12 to <18 years
had a higher incidence of Grade ≥3 events (difference of >5%) in the following SOCs: gastrointestinal
disorders (30.1% versus 21.7%), hepatobiliary disorders (6.0% versus 0.7%), nervous system
disorders (12.0% versus 7.0%), and vascular disorders (9.6% versus 5.6%). Adolescents ≥12 to <18
years compared with children ≥2 to <12 years had a higher incidence of Grade 23 events in the Renal
and urinary disorders SOC (23.8% versus 18.1%).
Deaths
Of the 833 patients exposed to glucarpidase across all clinical studies, 116 patients (13.9%) were
reported to have died. Of these, 57 patients (6.8%) died within 30 days of the last dose of
glucarpidase, 47 patients (5.6%) died >30 days after the last dose of glucarpidase, and for 12 patients
(1.4%), the date of death relative to the last dose of glucarpidase is unknown. No deaths occurred in
the healthy volunteer subjects.
For the majority of the events that led to the 97 patient deaths across the studies of glucarpidase, the
relationship to glucarpidase was not recorded. For 53 patients who died, the investigator assessed the
fatal event(s) as not related to glucarpidase. For one patient (01-0004 in Study 001), one of two fatal
events were assessed as possibly related to glucarpidase (coma, neurological decompensation): 18-
year old patient with ALL experienced the day after glucarpidase administration "M+suspected induced
meningoencephalitis". The patient's condition deteriorated, and coma was diagnosed 10 days after
receipt of glucarpidase. Other SAEs that occurred at the time were neurological deterioration, nervous
system disorder, hydrocephalus, and intracranial pressure increased. The causes of death were
reported to be coma, neurological decompensation and encephalitis.
In the Main Safety Population 74/489 (15.1%) of patients with evidence of follow-up were reported to
have died: 39 (8%) within 30 days of the last dose of glucarpidase and 23 (5%) who died > 30 days
after the last dose of glucarpidase. For the remaining 12 patients, the date of death relative to
glucarpidase dosing is not known.
In the Main Safety Population, events recorded as having a fatal outcome were most commonly in the
General disorders and administration site conditions, Infections and infestations, and Neoplasms
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) SOCs. The most common fatal events were
death, disease progression, malignant neoplasm progression, multi- organ failure and sepsis; all other
events occurred in <1% of patients.
The incidence of fatal events was the same in the groups of patients who received one and two doses
of glucarpidase (54/355, 15.2% and 16/105, 15.2%, respectively).
Analysis per Age Subgroups
1 fatal SAE reported in the Infant Subgroup: histiocytosis haemopophagic (fatal outcome > 30 days
after the last glucarpidase treatment).
The overall incidence of events with outcome of death was higher in children ≥2 to <12 years (6/83,
7.2%) than in adolescents ≥12 to <18 years (6/143, 4.2%).

Taking post-marketing vigilance data into consideration with clinical trial data, Table 42 summarises
the combined incidence of related adverse reactions from both clinical trials and post marketing
experience. The evaluation of adverse reactions in patients receiving glucarpidase was confounded,
because patients had toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations due to prolonged methotrexate
clearance. The data in Table below therefore excludes adverse reactions likely to be associated with
toxic methotrexate plasma concentrations, such as acute kidney injury, renal failure and blood
creatinine increases. In addition, all unlikely related adverse reactions and adverse reactions deemed
unrelated following additional BTG medical assessment were also removed.

The frequency of the related adverse events was uncommon, rare or very rare as per the EMA
Important medical terms list, MedDRA version 22.0, 12-Mar-2019. No common or very common events
have been reported.
There have been no updates to the risk/benefit profile, no important foreign regulatory actions noted
and no communications of new safety information have been made since the launch of glucarpidase in
the US (as per the PADER data collected up to the 16th April 2019).
2.6.9. Discussion on clinical safety
The safety of glucarpidase is supported by 14 clinical studies and based on 8-years post-marketing
experience from USA. The main limitations of the currently available safety data set is that it derives
from heterogeneous clinical studies performed at various time periods. These studies have different
designs (e.g. administration of different doses; single or repeated administration of up to 3 doses),
different methodology of data collection (e.g. number of missing data) and including patients with
different diagnosis and tumour types. Moreover, it is quite challenging to distinguish glucarpidase
related toxicity in patients suffering from life-threatening HD-MTX toxicity in the context of single-arm
trials. Therefore, most of the common TEAEs, SAEs and common Grade ≥3 TEAEs were sequalae to
HD-MTX treatment.

Pooled data from 6 completed clinical studies defined the Main Safety Population (492 patients). 343 of
them represent the Target Population for which registration is sought. Paediatric and adult patients
were represented almost equally. Exposure data showed that all paediatric subgroups were
represented (≥28 days to <2 years, ≥2 to <12 years and ≥12 to <18 years of age). No data were
available in children <28 days.
The median dose and median cumulative dose of glucarpidase were 50 U/kg and approximately 75% of
patients received a single dose of glucarpidase (from a max of three in some studies).
11% of patients reported treatment-related AE, most commonly assessed paraesthesia (2%), flushing
(1.8%) and headache (1.5%). Only a few hypersensitivity reactions were reported (Type I - 2.6%;
Type III - 1.2%). Considering the nature of the investigated substance, the very low frequency of
reported treatment-related AEs could be correct.
Approximately one-third of patients in both populations experienced SAEs and less than 2% had at
least one treatment-related SAE (hypertension, hypersensitivity). Most deaths occurred after
glucarpidase elimination time and were probably secondary to sepsis/infection, or to progression of the
patient's underlying disease which are expected causes of death in an oncology population receiving
HD-MTX. However, for one third of the reported SAEs and for the majority of the events that led to the
patient's death, the relationship to glucarpidase was not recorded and this could confound the analysis.
The obtained results related to haematology and biochemistry were in line with the known safety of
HD-MTX and do not indicate any substantial patterns associated with glucarpidase administration,
although the presented safety evidence is limited.
The pharmacokinetics of glucarpidase in the absence of MTX from 4 subjects with severe renal
impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) showed that the mean pharmacokinetic parameters were similar to
those observed in healthy subjects (SmPC section 4.2). On this basis, no dose adjustment of
glucarpidase is recommended for patients with renal impairment.
The additional safety analysis per paediatric subgroups has not revealed any new safety trends with
the majority of adverse events related to glucarpidase being mild to moderate reactions. The data
suggest that a difference in safety in paediatric patients compared to adult patients would not be
expected. No clear relationship between age group and the incidence of related TEAEs was identified.
There are no data from the use of glucarpidase in pregnant women. Glucarpidase is administered in
combination with MTX, which is contraindicated in pregnancy. As use of MTX, a genotoxic and
teratogenic agent, is a prerequisite for the use of glucarpidase, the product is not thought to present
an additional risk to patients already receiving MTX. Reproductive studies of glucarpidase in animals
were not performed. It is unknown whether glucarpidase causes harmful effects during pregnancy
and/or on the foetus/newborn child or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Glucarpidase should
only be given to a pregnant woman if clearly needed (see SmPC 4.6).
No cases of overdose were recorded during the clinical programme, but several patients were
administered higher doses of glucarpidase (single doses of 90.9 to 188.7 U/kg or cumulative doses of
150.0 to 201.8 U/kg). The safety analysis of high single doses did not show any AEs distinguishable
from the currently proposed dose. In case of overdose, it is recommended to stop glucarpidase, and
patients should be observed and appropriate supportive care should be provided (see SmPC 4.9).
The immune response related to glucarpidase therapy is not anticipated to be of high risk taking into
account the route of administration and one single dose. 205 patients who received one (n=176), 2
(n=27), or 3 (n=2) doses of glucarpidase were evaluated for anti-glucarpidase antibodies. Forty-three
of these 205 patients (21%) had detectable anti-glucarpidase antibodies following administration, of
which 32 received 1 dose and 11 received 2 or 3 doses of glucarpidase. Antibody titers were

evidence for these comes largely from case studies.
In conclusion, as acute MTX toxicity is a rare emergent life-threatening condition, a comparative study
design would be impossible to conduct. Therefore, it is not possible to generate comprehensive data,
and recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered
appropriate.
3.8. Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Voraxaze is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section
'Recommendations'.
4. Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Voraxaze is favourable in the following indication:
Voraxaze is indicated to reduce toxic plasma methotrexate concentration in adults and children (aged
28 days and older) with delayed methotrexate elimination or at risk of methotrexate toxicity.
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional
circumstances subject to the following conditions:
