2. Scientific discussion

2.1. Problem statement

2.1.1. Disease or condition

The assessed product is an intended vaccine to prevent meningococcal disease by triggering the production of serum bactericidal antibodies against the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W. The proposed therapeutic indication is as follows:

"MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations."

2.1.2. Epidemiology and prevention

Meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis) are transmittable bacteria with a high incidence to induce meningococcal disease in humans. Their virulence is mostly based on the biochemical structure of capsular polysaccharides. So far 12 distinct meningococcal serogroups have been classified, with serogroups A, B, C, W, X and Y being responsible for most cases of meningococcal disease. Dynamics of meningococcal transmission, acquisition, and carriage in humans are a major influence on the incidence and likelihood of meningococcal disease. However, the worldwide incidences of meningococcal disease vary greatly among regions. The European population is mostly affected by serogroup B, but also C and Y are responsible for some of the reported cases (Peterson et al. 2019). The presently best-known prevention against meningococcal disease is the up-front immunization with vaccines targeting the relevant serogroups.

2.1.3. Biologic features Aetiology

The natural habitat and reservoir of meningococci are the upper respiratory nasopharyngeal mucosal membranes. N. meningitidis is a common commensal, carried by approximately 8% to 20% of the normal population, but the prevalence of carriage varies widely and does not directly predict meningococcal disease. However, any impact on meningococcal carriage will also have an impact on the incidence of meningococcal disease. The rates of meningococcal disease are influenced by factors that enhance exposure and transmission, carriage rates of strains with different virulence potential, and host factors. Transmission is by direct contact with or inhalation of meningococcus in large droplet nuclei that are acquired through close contact with respiratory secretions and saliva. However, acquisition can be transient, induce meningococcal disease or lead to colonialization and carriage.

2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis

During the course of meningococcal infection, a meningitis and sepsis can develop, both being potentially lethal. Thus, the untreated mortality rate of meningococcal disease is high and the pathogenesis is not completely understood. Additionally, survivors of the disease often suffer from severe neurological, visual or

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 11/121

hearing impairments (Peterson et al. 2019). The best-known method for prevention of the disease is the immunization against disease-causing serogroups.

2.1.5. Management

The most important host-dependent factor is the presence of serum bactericidal antibodies that neutralize the organism by complement-mediated bacteriolysis. Anti-capsular meningococcal antibodies protect against meningococcal disease via complement mediated bactericidal activity.

Meningococcal vaccines induce the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups. MenACYW conjugate vaccine is intended to induce antibody production specific for the capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W. In multiple European countries meningococcal C (MenC) vaccination is recommended for toddlers, even though the favoured timing of vaccination differs among countries. Additionally, two quadrivalent MenACWY vaccinations are available in Europe: Nimenrix, licensed in the EU since 20/04/2012 and indicated for the immunization from the age of 6 weeks, as well as Menveo, licensed in the EU since 15/03/2010 and indicated for the immunization of children from 2 years of age, adolescents and adults.

Menveo is also available in the US but not Nimenrix. In addition, other MenACWY vaccinations are available in the US: Menactra is approved from infants as young as 9 months of age to adults 55 years of age, and Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, a polysaccharide vaccine, which was licensed for persons 2 years of age and older at the time of the clinical trials. The production was discontinued in 2017 by the applicant (MAH of Menomune). According to the applicant, the decision was strategic and not based on any quality, safety, or efficacy issues.

2.2. Quality aspects

2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product (FP) is presented as a 0.5 mL solution for injection containing as active substance (AS) 10 ug each of serogroups A, C, W (also referred to as W135) and Y meningococcal polysaccharide (PS), individually conjugated to 55 ug tetanus toxoid carrier.

Other ingredients are: sodium chloride, sodium acetate and water for injection.

The conjugate vaccine FP is available in a 2 mL Type I borosilicate clear glass vial with a 13 mm chlorobutyl stopper and a flip off seal.

2.2.2. Active Substance

General information

The N. meningitidis Polysaccharide (Groups A, C, Y and W135) Conjugate Vaccine contains four active substances comprised of serogroup-specific polysaccharide antigens purified from Neisseria meningitidis Serogroups A, C, Y, and W135, separately conjugated to tetanus toxoid.

The meningococcal polysaccharide components were originally EU-authorised as the active substances Menomune A, Men - C, Men A/C and Menomune A/C/Y/W135 and are the same as those used in the manufacture of the meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (Menactra). The tetanus toxoid protein component used to prepare the polysaccharide- protein monovalent conjugates is the same as that used as a carrier in the EU authorised Haemophilus influenzae type b tetanus protein conjugate vaccine (ActHIB).

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

Sanofi Pasteur, 1541 Avenue Marcel Mérieux, 69280 Marcy l'Etoile, France is responsible for manufacture of the tetanus toxoid carrier protein (concentrated tetanus protein intermediate).

Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. Discovery Drive Swiftwater, PA 18370-0187 USA is responsible for manufacture of the AS intermediate (N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder) and AS (N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate, serogroup A, C, Y, and W). Approved contract testing facilities are also specified. Appropriate GMP certificates/ authorisations are available for all sites.

Description of manufacturing process and process controls

Manufacture of polysaccharide bulk powder

Neisseria meningitidis working seed banks (WSBs) of the respective serogroups (Groups A, C, Y and W135) are individually propagated and fermentation is upscaled in fermenters. The fermentation broth is harvested and inactivated using phenol. The inactivated broth is concentrated. After precipitation the diluted filtrate is concentrated and treated with enzymes to remove nucleic acids and proteins, extracted with phenol, precipitated and dried to yield the AS intermediates, N. meningitidis Polysaccharide Purified Bulk Powders (Groups A, C, Y and W135). In process controls during fermentation are considered appropriate. There are no

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 13/121

reprocessing steps for N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder, serogroup production process. The AS intermediate, N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powder is filled into bottles and stored.

Manufacture of tetanus toxoid (TT)

Inoculated working seed lot (WSL) is cultivated, fermented and upscaled. After cell lysis and harvest, the toxin is diafiltered and concentrated. Precipitation is followed by dialysis and filtration. The purified tetanus toxin is then inactivated. The purified tetanus toxoid, referred to as purified tetanus protein (PTP), is further concentrated and purified, yielding the concentrated tetanus protein (CTP). CTP is filtered, Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA, USA for storage. Once it is received at Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA, USA, it is referred to as tetanus toxoid, purified.

For serogroups C, Y and W135, a concentration step is additionally performed on the tetanus toxoid, purified prior to filtration until used for conjugation. For serogroup A, the tetanus toxoid protein is filtered into bags.

In process controls during the PTP and CTP, purified manufacturing process are suitably documented. There are no established reprocessing procedures for concentrated tetanus protein or tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate. Hold times proposed throughout the AS manufacturing process are considered acceptable based on the information provided.

Manufacture of conjugate

Serogroup A purified bulk powder is activated and derivatised using a linker. Serogroup C, Y and W purified bulk powder is depolymerised and activated. Depolymerised and activated bulk powder is purified and may be stored under defined conditions before conjugation. After diafiltration and purification, the active substance is 0.2 um filtered into bioprocess bags stored. Shelf life and storage conditions have been proposed for the AS and found acceptable. In-process controls are suitably defined. In the event a breach or integrity failure is observed from the beginning of the conjugate filtration process until the completion of dispense process, one refiltration of the conjugate is permitted. Details of the refiltration process are suitably defined.

Control of materials

The bacterial seed bank system consists of a N. meningitidis pre-master seed, animal component free master seed and animal component free working seed for each serogroup. Preparation of the seed banks and associated in-process controls are defined. All the seed banks are stored at ≤ 60ºC.

The seed lot system for Clostridium tetani consists of a master seed bank and an intermediate seed bank. From the intermediate seed bank, new working cell banks are established. The same seed bank system was assessed for the company's Haemophilus type B conjugated polysaccharide vaccine licensed in several EU member states (Act-HIB). The approach adopted to monitor the stability of WSL for C. tetani and WSBs for N. meningitidis Serogroups A, C, Y and W135 is considered acceptable. A protocol for establishment of future WSLs/WSBs has been provided.

The applicant provides a detailed list of the control of raw materials, of prepared solvents, reagents, media and buffer material, water for manufacturing and gases used in the manufacturing process of the ASs. Raw materials are divided into pharmacopoeial grade components (Ph. Eur. or USP) and non-pharmacopoeial grade components. The specifications for the non-pharmacopoeial grade materials are provided in sufficient detail. The internal specifications are well defined and are acceptable for the intended use of the material. Materials of ruminant origin used in the production of concentrated purified tetanus protein bulk comply with

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 14/121

Ph. Eur. 1483 and 5.2.8 with respect to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) safety (see adventitious agents' section).

Control of critical steps and intermediates

During the manufacture of the active substances, critical process parameters (CPPs), in-process controls and release tests have been implemented to ensure that the manufacturing process steps remain under control and meet their established operating range and specifications. Ranges of critical process parameters during the manufacturing process of the active substances and its intermediates have been verified by small scale studies and are considered adequate. The control strategy has been adequately explained.

Purified bulk powder

Specifications and batch analysis data have been provided for the purified bulk powder and the activated/derivatised (serogroup A) and depolymerised/activated (serogroup C, Y, W135) polysaccharide intermediates. Critical steps for the manufacturing of the purified bulk powder are accurately defined and controlled.

A stability study was conducted using three batches of purified bulk polysaccharide powder of each serogroup. The outcome of the study justifies the established hold time of this intermediate. The dried powder was tested for molecular size, phosphorous content, O-acetyl content, identity, bacterial endotoxin, nucleic acids content, protein content and moisture.

Batch analysis data shows that the activated/derivatised and depolymerised/activated polysaccharide intermediates are manufactured consistently. Phase III batches, manufactured in building 46 of Swiftwater, PA, USA site, used in clinical studies have been compared to batches manufactured in building 56 of Swiftwater, PA, USA site showing consistency of critical quality attributes (CQAs) throughout clinical development.

A hold study was performed to support the storage conditions and hold time of activated polysaccharides. Tested parameters were total and free linker, reducing activity and bioburden.

Tetanus toxoid

The intermediates involved in the manufacture of the tetanus component of the AS are the: purified tetanus protein (PTP); concentrated tetanus protein (CTP) and tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate. Each intermediate can be stored. Each intermediate, except the tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate, is analysed by quality control release tests and must be in compliance with its specification. Batch analyses data are provided.

Release tests for the PTP include protein/total nitrogen content and ratio, OD280/OD260 ratio, flocculating titre, antigenic purity, molecular size distribution and sterility. Release tests performed on the CTP are protein nitrogen content, OD280/OD260 ratio, phosphorous limit test, residual free formaldehyde, flocculation titre, antigenic purity, molecular size distribution, sterility, endotoxin and absence of toxin/irreversibility of toxoid.

CPPs and their ranges for PTP and for the CTP have been evaluated and accurately defined. Batch analyses have been performed on the three intermediate levels (PTP, CTP, TT filtered concentrate), showing the consistency of the manufacturing process. Stability data provided justify claimed hold time.

Process validation

Purified Tetanus Protein (PTP): The validation of the PTP production was divided into the validation of the Clostridium tetani fermentation process and harvest/purification /detoxification steps of the concentrated tetanus toxin to obtain the PTP. All CPPs, in-process control testing and quality control acceptance criteria

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 15/121

were met. In conclusion, the manufacturing process for the purified tetanus protein is validated, from the inoculum preparation to the detoxification stage.

Concentrated Tetanus Protein (CTP): The CPP and the quality control testing for concentrated tetanus protein batches were met. The manufacturing process for the concentration steps of the PTP to obtain the CTP is validated. Shipping validation of the CTP is provided.

Tetanus Toxoid, Filtered Concentrate: By evaluating the CQAs, the study validated the consistency of the AS intermediate, tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate manufacturing process. In addition, a study was performed to establish the hold time for the tetanus toxoid filtered, concentrate stored at 1 ºC to 5 ℃ in bags prior to conjugation. All validation data showed conformity to the acceptance criteria. The tetanus toxoid, filtered concentrate process consistently produced an AS intermediate that meets the critical quality attributes thus demonstrating suitability for use in the conjugation process.

N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powders (serogroups A, C, Y, W135): During process validation, the critical process parameters and critical quality attributes were evaluated. Results for all three validation/consistency lots met pre-defined acceptance criteria. These results demonstrated that the manufacturing process for the AS intermediates, N. meningitidis polysaccharide purified bulk powders (serogroups A, C, Y, W135), consistently produced a product that meets all the specifications and quality characteristics.

N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrates serogroups (A, C, Y and W135): The manufacturing processes for the ASs are comprised of both common unit operations and serogroup-related specificities. The validation studies supporting unit operations and performed with batches produced in Building 46 (B46) are presented. The unit operation validation studies include: mixing studies, column chromatography studies, filtration (& re-filtration under specified conditions) validation, hold-time studies and column re-use studies.

The manufacturing process for the ASs, N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrates (serogroups A, C, Y, W135), was initially developed and validated in the B46 production facility. After the production of process validation/clinical consistency batches, the AS manufacturing was transferred to the production facility in Building 56 (B56) for commercial manufacturing. Three comparability batches were manufactured in B56 and the data collected was assessed against the same validation criteria as batches manufactured in B46.

The process consistency and comparability validation studies performed using six batches of the AS of each serogroup are provided: 3 consecutive, full-scale validation and consistency batches manufactured in B46, and 3 consecutive, full-scale comparability batches manufactured in B56.

Manufacturing process development

Changes during the manufacturing process from Phase I have been described extensively and the impact of changes have been assessed by comparing consistency lots of every different serogroup to historical data. All acceptance criteria were met for all batches.

The major changes in the manufacturing process between production of AS (conjugate concentrates) clinical Phase I lots and Phase III comparability lots include increase in batch size of PTP and change in the seed lot system. The comparability exercise is considered acceptable. There were no changes in the manufacturing process of N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate, serogroup A, C, Y and W135, between Phase III clinical consistency/process validation and comparability lots produced at manufacturing scale.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Characterisation

For the characterization of the purified polysaccharide bulk powder, 1D proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and high-performance size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light scattering (HPSEC-MALS) testing have been performed. For characterization of TT carrier protein intermediates, differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) for PTT, PTP and CTP intermediates was performed. Characterization studies confirm chemical and structural attributes of intermediates.

The concentration of process residuals was measured in the active substance and the concentration in the finished product was calculated. Process residuals have been assessed in the AS and FP. All parameters were below the acceptance criteria. The extent and results of the study justifies the absence of routine testing of the identified process residuals. Batches tested for impurities are representative of clinical material.

Regarding product-related impurities, degradation impurities confirm the efficiency of the conjugation process over time. The concentration of free polysaccharide and free protein are considered as stability indicating and provide information about degradation of the active substance. Free polysaccharide and free protein assays are performed on each batch of the AS during stability.

Specification

The AS release specifications for each serogroup conjugate include appropriate physicochemical tests and tests for identity, protein content, polysaccharide content, polysaccharide to protein ratio, molecular size distribution, free polysaccharide content, free protein content, O-acetyl, endotoxin and bioburden test.

The release specifications for free protein will be reassessed once an adequate number of batches are tested and the results are analysed (see recommendation 1). The specifications have been justified in accordance with ICH Q6B.

The release specifications of the active substances were requested to include specifications for appearance. The applicant will evaluate the need for the test for routine operation after a minimum of 30 active substance batches from each serogroup (see recommendation 3). This is considered acceptable.

Analytical methods

The extent of validation of the analytical methods, with some exceptions, corresponds to ICH Q2 (R1) and the respective chapters of Ph. Eur. The analytical procedures are considered appropriate for the intended purpose.

Batch analysis

Active substance phase III clinical consistency/process validation batches and comparability batches of every serogroup were tested. Analytical procedures and specifications were the same as for release testing.

The results of all batches are within the acceptance criteria. No apparent trend or shift in analytical results between validation lots and comparability lots has been identified. Batch to batch consistency has been demonstrated for the validation lots, and comparability lots. It is concluded that the batches were manufactured consistently and according to pre- defined quality standards, and that the production process has been successfully transferred to the site intended for commercial production.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 17/121

Reference materials

The applicant stated that no reference standard is used for the ASs. For the purified tetanus protein and concentrated tetanus protein, the reference material is an in-house flocculating standard for tetanus (antitoxin) calibrated against the international flocculation standard for tetanus (NIBSC) and stored at 2 ℃ to 8 °C. Polysaccharide concentrates are used to demonstrate the serogroup identity and specificity, and also that purified polysaccharide powders do not contain other serogroups.

During the procedure, the applicant was requested to provide information on all internal reference materials used in the control testing at any stage of product manufacture, including information on the type of reference, preparation instructions, storage conditions and shelf life of the different reference standards and materials. The applicant has now satisfactorily provided the requested information on the in-house reference materials used and the process for qualification of new reference lots is described.

Container Closure System

The container closure system for the ASs, N. meningitidis polysaccharide tetanus toxoid conjugate concentrate, Group A, C, Y and W135 is a bioprocess bag. Compliance with the Ph.Eur. requirements for the container closure system has been demonstrated. Comprehensive extractable and leachable studies have been performed, the results of which are acceptable.

Stability

The stability testing program presented by the applicant is considered to be appropriate and in accordance with ICH. Stability studies have been performed on the same phase III clinical consistency/process validation batches and comparability batches used for batch analysis. An accelerated study has been completed. A real time study is ongoing and the applicant commits to complete the stability testing for all ongoing studies according to the presented stability protocol.

The analytical procedures chosen for the program are suitably stability-indicating for the active substance. The containers used for the study conforms to the ones used in the manufacturing process. Tests are scheduled at appropriate time points.

The data presented shows that all results generated so far met the pre- set specifications and no apparent trend could be observed in the real time stability study. Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. Shelf-life and storage conditions for the active substance have been proposed by the applicant and found acceptable.

* Tetanus toxoid quantity is approximate and dependent on the polysaccharide to protein ratio for the conjugates used in each formulation.

Different polysaccharide contents were used during Phase I studies: 2 ug, 4 ug and 10 ug per polysaccharide per dose, as well as 10 ug of polysaccharide for serogroups A and W135 and 4 ug of polysaccharide for serogroups C and Y. The Phase II clinical batches were manufactured with the final formulation of 10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup per dose. The Phase IIb and Phase III clinical batches utilised a manufacturing process that was scaled up. There are no differences in the formulation between the Phase IIb / Phase III clinical batches and the final formulation. Manufacturing was transferred to the site of commercial production during phase III. Phase III and commercial batches of the finished product are formulated/filled at Sanofi Pasteur site in Swiftwater, PA, USA. Comparability between the batches throughout Phase I to Phase III manufacturing process has been shown.

Comparability was demonstrated showing that the final container vaccine manufactured using the Phase I through Phase III processes are comparable based on the critical quality attributes.

In accordance with the Ph.Eur. monograph for meningococcal conjugated vaccines (07/2019:3066), the production method is required to be validated in order to demonstrate that the product, if tested, would

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 19/121

comply with the test for pyrogens (Ph.Eur. 2.6.8). Sufficient justification regarding the pyrogenicity of the product was provided by the applicant during the procedure.

The vaccine is filled in 2 ml glass vials, closed with an appropriate stopper and a flip-off seal. For phase I and phase II, 3 ml glass vials were used. The suitability of the container closure system has been demonstrated by extractables, leachables, cytotoxicity and stability studies. The container-closure system complies with Ph. Eur. requirements.

Manufacture of the product and process controls

Meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, Y, and W135) tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine, is manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Discovery Drive, Swiftwater, PA 18370, USA. The site for EU batch release is Sanofi Pasteur, Industrial Park Incarville, 27100 Val de Reuil, France. Appropriate GMP certification for these sites has been provided.

Each monovalent conjugate is thawed. Sodium acetate buffer, conjugates and sodium chloride buffer are mixed. Following 0.22 um filtration, the mixture is transferred to portable tanks. Sodium chloride buffer is added to the final volume through the 0.22 um filter. The portable tank is stored at 1 ºC to 5 ºC for up to 6 months.

Prior to filling, the contents of the portable container are mixed and then 0.22 um filtered. 2 ml vials are rinsed with WFI and depyrogenated before filling.

The 0.22 um filtration of the bulk from the portable tanks prior to filling is considered a critical process step. Therefore, bioburden is measured before filtration. Pre-filtration bioburden is also measured before filling in the 2 ml vials. Weight check is performed in order to control the filling volume. Final containers are 100% visually examined according to USP. There is no pooling of AS batches in the preparation of one FP lot.

Comprehensive studies have been performed for the validation of the formulation and filling process, at two different scales. All CPPs and CQAs have been defined and assessed, on a total of seven lots for the small- scale process and four lots for the large scale process.

Studies were conducted on the formulation tank and portable tanks to validate mixing. The measurements of all time points of all tanks met the pre-set criteria.

The lots were assessed against validation acceptance criteria which consisted of the established process parameters, in-process controls and CQAs for the filling validation. Routine testing for the FP was conducted. Additional non-routine samples were taken across the fill to evaluate the total and % free polysaccharide, total protein and pH.

A summary of the non-critical controlled and/or monitored process parameters for the FP manufacturing process including a clarification of the classification exercise was requested in the list of questions. The requested information on non-critical and/or monitored process parameters for finished product has been provided and is considered acceptable. Critical process parameters and quality attributes are therefore considered well defined and controlled. Appropriate media fill studies and filter validation studies were conducted.

The packaged finished product is shipped from the production facility to the Sanofi distribution centre. A summary of the shipping validation study has been provided upon request and is acceptable.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 20/121


Overall, a detailed description of the manufacturing process for the AS has been presented by the applicant. The deviations filed during the process validation studies are extensively explained and considered to have no impact on the quality of the studies and still permit a conclusion that the process is under suitable control. The production process for the FP is considered to be acceptably validated.

Product specification

The FP specifications include appropriate physicochemical tests and tests for identity, purity and potency. The panel of product specifications for release of the final lot vaccine comprises tests for identity, total and free polysaccharide, total protein, molar mass, appearance, volume, pH, endotoxin, container closure integrity and sterility.

Release specifications for the bulk and final container product have been justified according to ICH Q6B and are considered acceptable. The applicant was asked to evaluate the risk of the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the MenQuadfi finished product in accordance with the published Art. 5(3) Referral on Nitrosamines (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490- assessment-report_en.pdf). A respective risk assessment has now been provided, showing no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the FP.

In conclusion, the program for control of finished product is considered adequate and conforms to the Ph. Eur. monographs 3066 Meningococcal group A, C, W135 and Y Conjugate Vaccine as well as 0153 Vaccines for Human Use.

Analytical methods

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The panel of release tests for final lot vaccine comprises tests for identity, total and free polysaccharide, total protein, molar mass, appearance, volume, pH, endotoxin, container closure integrity and sterility

Batch analysis

The final container FP was tested according to the release specifications. All tests passed the acceptance criteria. No visible shift or trend could be identified between the phase III clinical batches and the commercial batches. Therefore, it is concluded that the manufacturing process of the FP is consistent.

Reference materials

The dossier describes relevant reference materials utilized within the test methods and procedures for use.

Stability of the product

Stability studies have been performed on the bulk formulated and on the filled FP. The extent of the stability study program presented by the applicant is seen as adequate and in accordance with ICH guidelines. The chosen analytical procedures are stability-indicating and validated accordingly. The studies have been performed in the same containers that will be used for commercial batches.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 21/121

Stability studies performed at actual storage conditions (2 ℃ to 8 ℃) demonstrate the ability of the container closure system to maintain product sterility over the proposed holding period of the formulated bulk. Studies for the filled FP included a real time stability study, an accelerated stability study, photostability study and a forced degradation study.

The applicant commits to re-evaluate the end of shelf life specification, as soon as 8 more lots reach the end of shelf life at the stability program. The photostability study, conducted according to ICH guideline Q1B, shows that exposure to light has no influence on the packaged product.

A FP shelf life of 42 months at 2-8 ℃ is agreed.

Adventitious agents

The applicant provides a list of materials of animal origin used for establishment of the meningococcal seed lot system. For the master seed, no material of biological origin was used. Materials used for the establishment of the pre-master seed comply with the requirements of EMEA/410/01. Raw materials of ruminant origin are used in the production of Clostridium tetani seed lots (skimmed milk, meat extract, casein peptone, L-cysteine) and concentrated purified tetanus protein bulk (casein peptone, tryptone V, beef heart infusion, l-tyrosine, peptide N3) and comply with Ph. Eur. 1483 and 5.2.8 with respect to TSE safety.

The seed lots are tested for purity and the manufacturing process is performed aseptically and includes bacterial inactivation during the purification of the bacterial antigens. The finished product is tested for sterility. Viral clearance studies for the bacterial vaccine are not required as there is no host available for the propagation of virus. Some steps have the potential for the inactivation of viral particles. Therefore, there is a low risk for contamination with adventitious agents, which is acceptable.

2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The information provided in section 3 of the CTD is considered acceptable. The applicant gives a detailed description of the manufacturing process and process development of all ASs and FP. The production processes have been validated satisfactorily, CPPs and CQAs have been identified and implemented accordingly. The control strategies for all ASs and FP are considered to be acceptable. Analytical methods are considered to be scientifically sound and adequately validated. Consistency of the manufacturing process has been demonstrated.

Three recommendations are proposed see Table in 2.2.6 section.

2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction

To support MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine clinical development, nonclinical pharmacology studies were performed to demonstrate the ability of the vaccine to induce a specific and bactericidal antibody response to meningococcal polysaccharide antigens (Serogroups A, C, Y and W). The toxicology programme comprises a repeated dose toxicity study in CD rats and a preliminary immunogenicity and DART study in NZW rabbits. These studies were conducted to understand the toxicological profile of MenQuadfi, including the potential systemic and local effects and the potential risk to women of childbearing potential and their offspring. Additionally, immunogenicity examinations were included in all toxicology studies to demonstrate that the vaccine induces a specific immune response to the meningococcal polysaccharide antigens contained in MenQuadfi.

2.3.2. Pharmacology

It is considered acceptable that nonclinical pharmacology studies are limited to demonstration of immunogenic response via SBA assay and IgG response. No nonclinical data on protection against meningococcal infection by vaccine candidates (challenge studies) were generated. This is also in line with current guidance.

Mice, rat and rabbit strains were tested for their immunological responses after immunization with tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) conjugate vaccine formulations. The highest and most reproducible results were obtained in mice. Thus, different mouse strains were further evaluated to select the best fitted mouse model. Highest IgG and SBA titers against all four polysaccharides (serogroup A, C, Y and W) were measured in selected strain of mice. Thus, selected strain of mice were determined to represent the best model for the planned immunogenicity studies. The selected immunization dose of each meningococcal polysaccharide was found suitable for evaluating the immunogenicity of formulations of

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 23/121

tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid since it induced an immune response against all 4 polysaccharides with titers in the middle of the dose response curve.

For the selection of the appropriate immunization schedule and dose for polysaccharide specific total IgG and polysaccharide specific bactericidal response, additional dose-range finding studies were conducted in the selected strain of mice.

Selected strain of mice were immunized two or three times with the optimized level of polysaccharide/dose or with a decreasing dose regimen (0.5 ug, 0.25 ug and 0.13 ug of each serogroup/dose). Except for serogroup C (SBA Titer), PS specific total IgG and bactericidal antibody titers were similar or higher three weeks after the final boost injection. Although three injections of the optimized level of PS resulted in higher SBA titer and IgG levels, the responses after two injections were also significantly increased in a short period of time compared to the physiological saline control, and thus the applicant regarded the three-dose schedule to not offer any advantage over the two-dose schedule. Variable data was observed for the decreasing dose regimen with no significant benefit observed over the unique dose regimen.

The two-immunization schedule with optimized level of PS/dose associated with serum sampling three weeks post final boost were thus selected for PS specific total IgG and PS specific bactericidal response evaluation in the selected strain of mice. According to the submitted data immunological responses after three vaccinations were strongly increased compared to the two-dose regimen. Thus, the applicant's conclusion that the three- dose schedule does not offer ANY advantage over the two-dose schedule is not completely conclusive to the assessor. However, further studies using the two-dose schedule were subsequently performed and showed positive results when using the proposed dosing regimen.

Subcutaneous injection was performed in mice to allow a higher volume to be administered as compared to the clinically used intramuscular route. Additional studies injecting higher volumes via the intramuscular route would be feasible, e.g. in NZW rabbit, but have not been conducted. Intramuscular injection was investigated in toxicological studies in rats.

For immunogenicity evaluation of the final clinical formulation, groups of selected strain of mice were immunized with the GMP batch according to the dosing schedule determined in the previous studies, i.e. two subcutaneous injections (prime and booster) containing optimal concentration of each serogroup per dose. Three weeks after the second immunization the animals were bled and serum samples were tested using ELISA for PS specific total IgG determination and serum bactericidal assay (SBA) to determine PS specific bactericidal antibody titers.

For serogroup A, total IgG response was higher for the TetraMen-T (Demo) batch than with the clinical formulation. Both meningococcal vaccine batches showed significantly higher total IgG responses than the physiological saline control.

For serogroup C, vaccination responses for both, TetraMen-T (Demo) and clinical batch, were observed to be significantly higher than when using saline control. No significant differences were observed between serogroup C specific IgG responses induced by either TetraMen-T or TetraMen-Dt. However, in general, anti- C IgG responses induced by two of the meningococcal vaccines available commercially were higher than the antibody responses induced by the TetraMen-T (Demo) and TetraMen-Dt vaccines and in some cases the results were significant.

For serogroup Y and serogroup W135 similar results were obtained. All treatment groups showed significantly higher total IgG responses than the saline control, with TetraMen-T (Demo) formulation again showing

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 24/121

somewhat but insignificant higher total IgG response than the clinical batch. For serogroup C, the response after vaccination with TetraMen-T was higher than with TetraMen-Dt.

When testing for bactericidal antibody response, all serogroups were found significantly higher after meningococcal vaccination compared to the physiological saline control. For serogroup A and C, the TetraMen-T (Demo) formulation again showed significantly higher responses than the clinical formulation, for serogroup W135, the both TetraMen-T formulations showed significantly higher results than the saline, but the TetraMen-Dt formulation did not.

There was a strong correlation between the level of PS specific IgG and bactericidal antibodies induced in mice injected with TetraMen-T formulations for serogroups A, Y, W135 whereas the correlation between IgG and bactericidal responses elicited by the TetraMen-Dt vaccine was not always evident.

Summarized, MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine induced serogroup specific total IgG and bactericidal antibody responses in all serogroups (A, C, Y, W). Responses were significantly higher than the antibody responses observed in the saline control groups. There was a strong correlation between the level of PS specific IgG and bactericidal antibodies induced in mice injected with MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine formulations for serogroups A, Y, W, but not for serogroup C.

Dedicated studies on secondary pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology were not performed. This is in accordance with relevant guidance. Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted. However, interactions between MenQuadfi and other vaccines frequently administered to the same population have been investigated in clinical studies.

2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics

No non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies were submitted, which is in accordance with recent guidelines.

2.3.4. Toxicology

To support vaccine development and registration, a non-clinical toxicology programme was designed to assess the toxicological profile of MenQuadfi. This programme comprises a repeated dose toxicity study in CD rats (Study AES/0126) and a preliminary immunogenicity study (Study RED_00091026) and DART study (Study SP00047 DV1701) in NZW rabbits. The design of these studies is considered to be in line with recent guidelines.

Repeat dose toxicity

The toxicology studies were performed in compliance with GLP, except for the immunogenicity study phase in the repeat-dose toxicity study (Study AES/0126) in rats which was conducted in a non-GLP compliant facility. The lack of GLP compliance has neither been explained by the applicant in sufficient detail nor justified. Therefore, it was decided that the results of this study should be considered as not relevant for the clinical use of MenQuadfi. Nevertheless, in the rat repeated dose toxicity study (Study AES/0126), no critical findings were reported, indicating that the administration of MenQuadfi was well tolerated in rats.

However, several rats receiving the vaccine formulation did not show detectable antibody responses specific to an individual polysaccharide serogroup. Therefore, as the reliability of the results of study AES/0126 could not be sufficiently established, the applicant's original statement in the SmPC section 5.3 ("Non-clinical safety

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 25/121

data revealed no special risks for humans based on a repeat-dose toxicity and local tolerance study in rats ... ") was not supported. The applicant therefore conducted a change in the SmPC wording and deleted all references to the rat repeated dose toxicity study AES/0126. This amendment was considered acceptable

On Day 2 of the study, dark faeces were noted in the bedding of all cages housing treated animals. The applicant remarked to this observation that with no evidence of histopathological changes this finding was not considered toxicologically significant. However, the lack of a histopathological correlate could of course also be related to a transient adverse effect at the beginning of the study that resolved during the further course of the study until the animals were killed and their organs histologically examined. Hence, the lack of a histopathological correlate cannot be used as rationale to consider that this finding is not of toxicological relevance. The fact that dark faeces were found in all cages of treated animals strongly suggests that this observation is treatment related. However, considering that the relevance of the rat repeated dose study for humans was doubted, it was unclear whether this finding also beared relevance for the clinical use of MenQuadfi.

Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity

The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable based on the type of product and in line with current guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines.

Reproduction Toxicity

A developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of MenACYW conjugate vaccine on female fertility, embryo-foetal development (including an evaluation of teratogenicity) and early post-natal development of female NZW rabbits.

The study indicates that MenQuadfi does not pose relevant risks on the investigated endpoints of mating, fertility, ovarian and uterine parameters and natural delivery. Furthermore, MenQuadfi was demonstrated to be non-teratogenic, and no adverse effects were observed regarding pup survival, growth and development. In fact, the endpoints evaluated in the treatment group of this DART study were almost never statistically different to the ones of the vehicle group. In addition, the fact that antibodies against serogroup C capsular polysaccharides were detected in all treated dams and also in foetuses and pups indicates that the NZW rabbit was a suitable non-clinical model for the conduct of a DART study with MenQuadfi.

Toxicokinetic data

Studies assessing toxicokinetics of MenQuadfi have not been conducted. This is in line with applicable guidelines.

Local Tolerance

As part of the DART study in rabbits, the local tolerance to repeat IM doses of MenQuadfi vaccine was assessed in New Zealand White rabbits and no additional local tolerance studies were performed which is acceptable.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 26/121

2.3.5. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

According to the EMA ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*), an ERA should be provided for vaccine products that may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.

The applicant submitted a justification. In addition, as MenQuadfi does not contain adjuvants, the applicant's position that MenQuadfi vaccine is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment was accepted by the Committee.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The applicant refers to pharmacology studies in different animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit) where the species' ability to produce an immune response to MenACYW conjugate vaccine has been compared. According to the Pharmacology written summary, the mouse model was chosen due to highest and most reproducible immune response. In humans, MenACYW conjugate vaccine is administered by intramuscular (IM) injection, while in the nonclinical studies, the vaccine is dosed subcutaneously (SC) to mice, and IM to rats and rabbits.

Overall, results from the nonclinical experiments in selected strain of mice form a reasonable basis to justify selection of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine formulation for further evaluation in the clinic. Due to factors such as difference in size, MHC/HLA dissimilarities, and differences with regard to route of administration and dosing regimen, animal models may have limited predictive value for immunogenicity in humans and results from animal studies should thus be considered with caution. The use of the tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugate protein, which is already in use in other vaccines, appears acceptable. The safety of the vaccine must be taken into account in this regard.

The toxicology programme of this submission comprises a repeated dose toxicity study in CD rats (Study AES/0126), a preliminary immunogenicity study (Study RED_00091026) and a DART study (Study SP00047 DV1701) in NZW rabbits. These studies demonstrate that MenQuadfi was well tolerated in the rat and the rabbit. Overall, the non-clinical safety data demonstrate that MenQuadfi has an acceptable safety profile.

2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

From a nonclinical point of view, marketing authorisation can be supported.

Study MET28

Study MET28 was a phase I, randomized, modified single-blind, active-controlled (infants only), four-stage, step-down (by age), comparative (comparator Menjugate [monovalent C vaccine]), multi-center study to the evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (previously referred to as TetraMen-T) in healthy adults (aged ≥ 18 through < 40 years), toddlers (aged ≥ 12 through < 19 months), and infants (aged 2 months +28 days [60 through 88 days]) in Canada between July 25th 2006 and August 27th 2008.

Study description

The study included four stages:

Stage I:

Two groups of adults aged ≥ 18 to < 40 years received one injection of TetraMen-T: either a low-dose adjuvanted formulation (2 ug polysaccharide per serogroup with AIPO4) or a high-dose formulation (10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup) without adjuvant.

Stage II:

Two groups of toddlers aged ≥ 12 to < 19 months received one injection of TetraMen-T: either a low-dose adjuvanted formulation (2 ug polysaccharide per serogroup with AIPO4) or a high-dose formulation (10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup) without adjuvant.

Stage III:

Four groups of infants aged 2 months +28 days (60-88 days) at enrolment were to receive three doses of meningococcal vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, concomitantly with the routine vaccines Pentacel, Prevnar, and Engerix-B. The meningococcal vaccine was either to be the low-dose formulation of TetraMen-T (2 ug polysaccharide per serogroup without adjuvant), the low-dose adjuvanted formulation of TetraMen-T (2 ug polysaccharide per serogroup with AIPO4), the high-dose formulation of TetraMen-T (10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup without adjuvant), or the licensed meningococcal vaccine Menjugate. Menjugate (Novartis) is a monovalent (serogroup C) meningococcal vaccine conjugated to diphtheria CRM197 protein.

Stage IV:

A subset of subjects from all 4 infant groups were to receive a booster dose of TetraMen-T at 13 months of age (#28 days). Subjects who had received one of the 3 formulations of TetraMen-T in Stage III were to be given the same formulation for their booster dose. Those subjects who had received Menjugate in Stage III were to be given the low-dose adjuvanted formulation of TetraMen-T for their booster dose.

Blood for serological testing was collected before vaccination at Visit 1 (Day 0) from all subjects; at 28 to 42 days after vaccination from adults and toddlers; and at 28 to 42 days after the 3rd vaccination from infants. Infants who received a 4th dose in the 2nd year of life also provided a blood sample just prior to vaccination and at 28 to 42 days after the 4th dose.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 31/121

Functional antibodies to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 were measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement (SBA-HC) and/or baby rabbit complement (SBA-BR). No efficacy data were collected in this trial.

Results

Adults (Stage I):

All adult subjects (100.0%) achieved rSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for the 4 serogroups after vaccination. For both formulations, geometric means of rSBA titers were significantly higher for all 4 serogroups after vaccination as compared to pre-vaccination levels. The magnitude of the antibody response was higher in Group 2 (10 ug vaccine) versus Group 1 (2 ug vaccine + AIPO4).

Toddlers (Stage II):

The percentages of toddlers with an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 were lowest for serogroup A in both groups: 52.6% in Group 3 (2 ug vaccine + AIPO4) and 63.2% in Group 4 (10 ug vaccine) relative to the other serogroups in both groups: 100.0%, 78.9%, and 68.4% for serogroups C, Y, and W, respectively in Group 3 and 89.5% for each of the serogroups C, Y, and W in Group 4. There was no increase in geometric mean titers (GMTs) post- vaccination for serogroup A in Group 3 subjects, and just a marginal increase in Group 4 subjects. The highest increase was seen for serogroup C in both groups.

Infants (Stage III):

The percentage of infants, who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine, achieving an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 after 3 doses ranged from 22.5% (Group 5, 2 ug vaccine) to 61.5% (Group 6, 2 ug vaccine + AIPO4) for serogroup A; from 94.9% (Group 6) to 97.6% (Group 5) for serogroup C; from 90.2% (Group 5) to 100.0% (Group 6) for serogroup Y; and from 83.3% (Group 7, 10 ug vaccine) to 87.2% (Group 6) for serogroup W. In the control group, 100.0% of subjects achieved a post-Dose 3 titer ≥ 1:8 for serogroup C.

Infants (Stage IV, booster):

After the 4th dose, an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8 was achieved by 100.0% of subjects in Groups 5, 6, and 7 for serogroups Y and W; and by 83.3% to 100% for serogroup C. Similar to the other stages, the percentages of subjects achieving hSBA titers ≥ 1:8 for serogroup A was lower relative to the other serogroups in all groups, ranging from 22.2% in Group 7 to 58.3% in Group 6. The percentages were lower for Group 8 (Menjugate) subjects, who were receiving MenACYW conjugate vaccine for the first time. Post-Dose 4 GMTs confirmed the same low immune responses to serogroup A and robust immune responses for the other 3 serogroups in Groups 5, 6, and 7.

Study MET32

Study MET32 was a phase I/II, exploratory, randomized, observer-blinded, active-controlled (comparator NeisVac-C vaccine), parallel, multi-center study to the evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2 formulations and different dose levels of TetraMen-T Quadrivalent Meningococcal (A, C, Y and W-135) Polysaccharide Tetanus Protein Conjugate Vaccine in healthy, meningococcal vaccine-naïve toddlers (12 months #21 days aged) in Australia between April 21st 2008 and October 28th 2008.

Study description

The vaccine formulation underwent optimization to address the lower immune response to serogroup A observed in MET28, and study MET32 was conducted to evaluate 2 new formulations. Each of these 2 formulations of MenACYW conjugate vaccine was evaluated at different dose levels (described below), in order to look for a dose-response effect. The doses selected were based on the results from study MET28.

A single dose of one of the formulations or control vaccine was evaluated in a total of 368 toddlers aged 12 months (# 21 days) randomized to one of the following 6 groups:

· Group 1: Formulation 1, low dose (4 ug polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 22.1 ug tetanus toxoid protein)

· Group 2: Formulation 1, intermediate dose (4 ug polysaccharide per serogroups C and Y; 10 ug polysaccharide per serogroups A and W; and a total of 36.6 ug tetanus toxoid protein)

· Group 3: Formulation 1, high dose (10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 54.8 ug tetanus toxoid protein)

· Group 4: Formulation 2, low dose (4 ug polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 33.9 ug tetanus toxoid protein)

· Group 6: Formulation 2, high dose (10 ug polysaccharide per serogroup; and a total of 84.8 ug tetanus toxoid protein)

· Group 7: NeisVac-C (10 ug N. meningitidis group C polysaccharide, 10 to 20 ug tetanus toxoid, 0.5 mg Al3+ from aluminum hydroxide)

Blood for serological testing was collected from all subjects at Visit 1 (Day 0) before vaccination, and at Visit 2, 30 days (+7 days) after vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed using hSBA and rSBA.

No efficacy data were collected in this trial.

Formulation Differences

Data from this study have been used to support the final decision on the formulation to be carried forward in subsequent clinical studies.

The addition of the ADH linker improved antibody responses for serogroup A as demonstrated in the results using either human (Table 3.2) or baby rabbit complement sources in the SBA assay. Supported by the clinical results from Study MET32 (formulation 1 and formulation 2), the formulation evaluated in subsequent Phase II studies was a combination of serogroups A and C from formulation 1 and serogroups Y and W from formulation 2.

The conjugation chemistry for serogroup A was the same chemistry that was used in formulation 1 (ADH linker using CDI). The results of the Phase I/II clinical trial indicated that the high pH conjugation formulation 2 resulted in slightly more immunogenic conjugates; however, the higher polysaccharide:protein loading ratio was also lower likely due to base catalyzed hydrolysis of the polysaccharide and/or reactive aldehyde groups. Therefore, for the subsequent Phase II clinical trial the conjugation reaction was maintained at pH 8.0 # 0.2 in order to maintain a higher polysaccharide: protein loading ratio, but a base treatment (partial de-O- acetylation) step was added to the polysaccharide activation/depolymerization process. The resulting serogroup C conjugate was the most immunogenic conjugate tested. The conjugation chemistry for serogroup C was the same chemistry that was used in Phase I formulation 1 with the exception of a base treatment of the polysaccharide prior to activation by sodium metaperiodate. For serogroups Y and W, the results of Study MET32 indicated that the higher pH conjugation (formulation 2) resulted in slightly more

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 35/121

immunogenic conjugates, and therefore, the conjugation reaction was maintained at pH 9.5 + 0.5 for the Phase II batches. The conjugation chemistry for serogroups Y and W was the same chemistry that was used in Phase I formulation 2.

Main studies

Studies MET51, MET35, MET 57, MET43, MET49, MET50 and MET56 are considered main evidence for this MAA and are presented if not indicated otherwise in this order in each section.

MET 51

Phase III, modified double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-center trial to compare the immunogenicity and describe the safety of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to a single dose of a licensed quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide groups A, C, W-135, and Y conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT, Nimenrix) in toddlers (12 to 23 months of age) in the European Union (Spain, Hungary, Finland and Germany) who were either meningococcal vaccine-naïve or had received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy.

Healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months were randomized as follows depending on their meningococcal vaccine background:

Meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects:

Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following 2 groups:

Group 1: MenACYW conjugate vaccine

Group 2: Nimenrix

MenC-primed subjects:

Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the following 2 groups:

Group 3: MenACYW conjugate vaccine

Group 4: Nimenrix

Enrollment of MenC-primed subjects was stratified by the type of primed vaccine, MenC-TT (NeisVac-C) or MenC-CRM (Menjugate, Meningitec), considering that at least 25% and a maximum of 50% of subjects were to have been primed with MenC-CRM.

MET 35

Phase III, modified double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multi-center trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and describe the safety of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to Menveo in healthy children 2 through 9 years of age in the USA and Puerto Rico.

Subjects received a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or Menveo on D0:

· Group 1: MenACYW conjugate vaccine

· Group 2: Menveo

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 36/121

Enrollment was stratified by age: 250 children 2 through 5 years of age and 250 children 6 through 9 years of age, respectively, were planned to be enrolled in each group.

hSBA Vaccine Seroresponse Definitions

Two different hSBA vaccine seroresponse definitions have been used in the individual CSRs and are summarized in Table 9.

The first definition was used in the 3 earliest studies (MET44, MET50, and MET54). The second is the latest definition accepted by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research / US Food and Drug Administration (CBER/FDA). This definition was used in the individual Studies MET35, MET43, MET49, MET51, MET56, and MET57 and is the definition used in the integrated/pooled analysis in this Summary of Clinical Efficacy.

Immunological assays

Functional meningococcal antibody activity against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 is measured using serum bactericidal antibody (SBA) assay. The SBA is an in vitro method using a complement source from either baby rabbit (BR) or human (HC), that measures the antibody-mediated, complement-dependent killing of target bacteria for the purpose of measuring the immunological response to the capsular polysaccharides of Neisseria meningitides serogroups A, C, Y, or W-135. Bacteria, complement, and serially diluted serum are incubated together in microtiter plates. An agar overlay is added to the serum/complement/bacteria mixture and the plates are incubated again. The number of resulting bacterial colonies present in the wells is inversely proportional to the level of functional antibody present in the serum, which correlates with the immunological response of the subject. The endpoint titer is determined by the reciprocal serum dilution yielding ≥ 50% killing compared to the mean of the complement control wells containing no serum.

Immunity acquired through either natural exposure or vaccination to meningococcal antigens has been shown to correlate well with the level of complement-dependent bactericidal antibody detected by the SBA. The SBA-determined level of these functional antibodies is considered a widely acceptable surrogate of protective immunity and acceptable evidence for efficacy of vaccines prepared from the capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135. The surrogate was established from the assay utilizing human complement. To facilitate inter-laboratory comparisons of the bactericidal activity induced by meningococcal vaccines, an SBA-BR assay was established through a multi-laboratory study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in which Sanofi Pasteur participated. In 1999, under the auspices of the WHO, a meeting was held to further assess laboratory assays for the analysis of human serum for meningococcal serogroup A- and C-specific antibodies. From that meeting, several recommendations were made regarding the SBAs; including adoption of the CDC standardized SBA-BR as the optimal methodology to measure meningococcal antibodies. However, recent developments in the field have led CBER to require a human complement- based assay for the assessment and licensure of meningococcal vaccines. Overall, the comparison indicates that both assays demonstrate serogroup specificity.

Randomisation and blinding (masking)

Throughout comparative immunogenicity studies, subjects were randomly assigned to respective vaccination groups. Depending on the study population and objective, randomisation was stratified by demographic parameters (e.g. MET51: priming status, MET35, MET57, MET49: age). In several studies, stratification was not accounted for in the statistical analysis. Importantly, the statistical analysis of lot to lot consistency (MET43) did not take into account the stratified randomization by age-group.

Since the primary objectives of the studies had serological endpoints and the vaccines for the study groups had different appearances, the studies had a modified double-blind design. This means it contained an unblinded vaccine administrator while the subject/the subject's parent/LAR, the Investigator, the Sponsor and the rest of the study team, including laboratory technicians in charge of executing the serological testing, remained blinded to the subjects' group allocations throughout the entire study up to the database lock to avoid any bias. The unblinded site personnel prepared all vaccines, and then administered the vaccines to the subjects and did not participate in any safety evaluation of the subjects during study conduct.

Study 50 and 57, both evaluating MenQuadfi with concomitant vaccinations were open-label studies where only the laboratory technicians were blinded to group assignment.

All subjects will have their safety analysed according to the vaccine they actually received. If the vaccine received by a subject does not correspond to any study group, the subject will be excluded from the SafAS. The corresponding safety data will be presented in separate listings.

Per-Protocol Analysis Set: The PPAS is a subset of the FAS. The subjects presenting with at least one of the following relevant protocol deviations will be excluded from the PPAS: Subject did not meet all protocol- specified inclusion criteria or met at least one of the protocol-specified exclusion criteria: [ ... ]

Co-primary 1 (naïve and primed):

Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W were tested separately. If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the 2 percentages was > -10%, the inferiority assumption was rejected. For the 4 non-inferiority hypotheses using the response rates (percentages of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8), the 95% CI was stratified on the priming status (meningococcal vaccine naïve or primed with monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy) and calculated using the Wald method (normal approximation). Weighted average of the difference over strata was calculated using the Minimal Risk weights with the null variance method (10).

Co-primary 2 (naïve only):

Each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W was tested separately. If the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference between the 2 percentages was > -10%, the inferiority assumption was rejected.

For the 4 non-inferiority hypotheses using the response rates (percentages of subjects who achieved an hSBA titer ≥ 1:8), the CI of the difference in proportions was computed using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction (11).

Primary objective 1:

Each of the antigens of A, C, Y, and W serogroups was tested separately. If the 2-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the GMTs was > 1/2 and < 2 for each pair of lots and each antigen, the non-equivalence assumption was rejected (i.e. if the equivalence was demonstrated for each pair of lots).

For each of the equivalence hypotheses using the GMT ratios, the statistical methodology was based on the use of the 2-sided 95% CI of difference in means of postvaccination Log10 transformed titers between pairs of lots with normal approximation.

Primary objective 2:

For the 4 non-inferiority hypotheses using the seroresponse rates, the CI of the difference in proportions were computed for each of the serogroups A, C, Y, and W using the Wilson Score method without continuity correction (3).

Post-hoc Evaluation of the Superiority of MenACYW Conjugate Vaccine

Superiority of immune response of MenACYW conjugate vaccine, in terms of hSBA seroprotection rate (≥1:8), as compared to the respective comparator vaccine was tested as a posthoc analysis in meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects of MET35, MET43, MET49, MET50, and MET51 Studies per Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015) as all these five studies demonstrated non-inferiority of immune response between MenACYW conjugate vaccine and comparator vaccines. The serogroups were sequentially tested in the order of C, Y, W, and A to follow the epidemiological prevalence as observed globally across various age groups and were performed until a test did not succeed.

Superiority was achieved if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference was greater than 0%.

Superiority of the immune response induced by MenACYW conjugate vaccine in terms of hSBA seroprotection rate (≥1:8) was demonstrated for all 4 serogroups versus the different comparators in subjects aged 2 years and above:

· in meningococcal vaccine-naïve children as compared to Menveo in MET35

· in meningococcal vaccine-naïve adolescents and adults (10-55 years) as compared to Menactra in MET43

. in meningococcal vaccine-naïve adults aged 56 years and above as compared to Menomune in MET49

· in meningococcal vaccine-naïve adolescents as compared to Menveo in MET50

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 55/121

Superiority of the immune response induced by MenACYW conjugate vaccine in terms of hSBA seroprotection rate (≥1:8) was also demonstrated in meningococcal vaccine-naïve toddlers for serogroup C as compared to Nimenrix in MET51.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)

Integrated Analysis

Data obtained from the 9 Phase II and Phase III studies assessing the final formulation of MenACYW conjugate vaccine given as a single dose (Phase II studies MET44, MET50, and MET54, and Phase III studies MET35, MET43, MET49, MET51, MET56, and MET57) were presented in a pooled / integrated analysis report (5.3.5.3 Efficacy Integrated Analysis Report).

All Phase II and Phase III studies included in the pooled / integrated analysis report (see Table 1.3) were consistent in terms of general study design, the assessment of outcome measures, vaccine formulation, and in terms of the use of the hSBA assay for the assessment of bactericidal antibody titers against N meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. The immunogenicity pooled / integrated analysis was performed by meningococcal vaccine background (whether meningococcal vaccine-naïve or vaccine-primed).

The analysis for the meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects was performed by the following age groups:

· Toddlers 12 to 23 months (pooled MET51, MET54, and MET57) (N=1174)

· Children 2 through 9 years of age (MET35) (Na=458)

· Adolescents 10 through 17 years of age (pooled MET43 and MET50) (N=1921)

· Adults 18 through 55 years of age (MET43) (N=1410)

· Older adults and elderly ≥ 56 years of age (pooled MET44 and MET49) (N=628)

· Older adults 56 through 64 years of age (N=290)

· Elderly adults ≥ 65 years of age (N=338)

· Elderly adults 65 through 74 years of age (N=252)

· Elderly adults ≥ 75 years of age (N=86)

The analysis for the meningococcal vaccine-primed subjects was performed in the following age groups:

· Toddlers 12 to 23 months (MET51) (N=198)

· Adolescents and adults ≥15 years (MET56) (N=384)

Supportive studies

Study MET44

Study MET44 was a phase II, randomized, open-label (the laboratory technicians were blinded to group assignment), active-controlled, multi-center study to compare safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to the comparator Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 in healthy meningococcal vaccine-naïve subjects 56 years of age and older in between November 12th 2012 and January 17th 2013.

The applicant's conclusion that a difference between subjects' age of 56-64 years or ≥64 appeared to have not an impact on the immune response is supported.

There was a trend towards higher seroresponse rates in group 1 (MenQuadfi) compared to group 2 (Menomune). No concerns arise from the presented data.

Study MET54

Study MET54 was a phase II, randomized, parallel, open-label, active-controlled, multi-center study to compare safety and immunogenicity of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to the comparator Nimenrix in toddlers in Finland between 31 March 2015 and 19 August 2015.

Seroresponse rates 30 days following vaccination were in general comparable between MenQuadfi and Nimenrix.

This study was one of only two studies conducted in the EU in support of this MAA. Regarding differences compared to the toddlers study conducted outside the EU, please refer to assessment and the respective OC of study MET57.

Study MET39

Study MET39 was a phase II, randomized, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate 5 different schedules of MenACYW conjugate vaccination regarding safety and immunogenicity compared to concomitant routine paediatric vaccination (not including meningococcal vaccination) in healthy infants and toddlers in the US between December 16st 2009 and February 13th 2012.

This study is included in the AR for completeness only. The included patient population does not reflect the intended target population of this MAA. Therefore, no assessment of the immunogenicity or safety results was done.

2.5.2. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Design and conduct of clinical studies

Immunogenicity of MenQuadfi has been evaluated in seven pivotal studies. Additional evidence has been generated in five supportive studies.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 71/121

Overall, the design of the presented main studies is similar and considered adequate. In all studies the subjects received one dose of MenQuadfi or a comparator vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before vaccination and 30 days after vaccination. No immunogenicity data beyond 30 days after vaccination are currently available which is also considered as missing information in the RMP. The applicant plans three post marketing studies to provide respective data for long-term immune persistence. The studies will also evaluate the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself. All three studies are added in Annex II as category I post-marketing obligations.

In a scientific advice it was agreed to base the clinical development programme on immunogenicity studies and that no efficacy studies are necessary. This is based on the fact that a widely accepted immunological correlate of protection for meningococcal vaccines containing serogroups A, C, W and Y exists. This approach has also been used for licensing of previous conjugated meningococcal vaccines in Europe (Menveo, Nimenrix). This is also in line with the relevant EMA and WHO guidelines. The use of hSBA for primary immunogenicity analyses was adequately justified by the applicant and accepted in a previous SA. As supportive evidence, the applicant also provided data derived from rSBA for all patients in studies MET 50, 56 and 35 and for a subset of subjects in studies MET 43, 49, 51 and 57.

The presented serological assays are overall considered appropriate and suitable to generate sufficient data on immunogenicity of the vaccine.

The applicant presented three main endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity: seroprotection, seroresponse and geometric mean titers (GMTs). Seroprotection is defined as the percentage of subjects with an hSBA titer ≥1:8 while seroresponse extends this definition by taking into account prevaccination titers: For subjects with a pre-vaccination titer >1:8, an at least 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. In addition, GMTs are presented for each vaccination group, allowing the assessment of differences in immune response between vaccines. In general, the chosen endpoints seroresponse, seroprotection and GMTs were considered acceptable and adequate to address the study objectives. Additionally, percentages of subjects achieving an at least 4-fold increase of titres and RCDs were presented.

Although the cut-off for definition of hSBA seroprotection was ≥1:8, as also recommended in the SA, the applicant used a cut-off of ≥1:16 for definition of seroresponse in most of the pivotal studies (reaching an hSBA titer of ≥1:16 if <1:8 pre-vaccination or achieving a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer if ≥1:8 pre- vaccination). This is based on requirements of CBER/FDA. Although a hSBA titer of ≥1:4 can be considered as widely accepted correlate of protection for meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y, the use of higher cut- offs does not raise concerns per se.

In 4 studies non-inferiority of seroresponse rates after MenQuadfi against a comparator vaccine (quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine) was the primary objective (MET35, MET43, MET49, MET50). In study MET51, the primary objective was non-inferiority of seroprotection rates. It was not considered acceptable to adequately assess immunogenicity by sole achievement of a protective titer regardless of prevaccination titres in light of the rather high percentage of subjects with seroprotective titres at baseline. For seropositive subjects at baseline an, at least, 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. Upon request, the non-inferiority analysis of seroresponse for study MET57 was also provided. The evaluation of seroresponse was considered more informative for the assessment of immunogenicity.

The applicant justified the applied non-inferiority margins mainly based on precedence from other development programs, as well as feasibility concerns. A justification based on clinical considerations (e.g. relevance of a 10% lower seroresponse rate in terms of vaccine efficacy) or statistical considerations (e.g. assay sensitivity) was considered missing. However, given the reference to other development programmes

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 72/121

as well as the clear demonstration of NI against various comparator vaccines across studies, this issue was not further pursued.

No alternative vaccination schedule has been evaluated in the presented studies. Also, in the dose-finding studies, only one dose of MenQuadfi was investigated. Only study MET39 investigated different vaccination schedules, where the study population (healthy infants) does not reflect the currently intended target population (subjects from 12 months of age). In a previous scientific advice

(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015), it was recommended to include evaluation of one vs. two doses in one of the toddler studies. However, no such data are available. Of note, nonclinical immunogenicity data are only available from a two (or more) dose regimen. Based on non-clinical data it was therefore not considered self- evident why only a one-dose-regimen was investigated in clinical studies. Given the absence of persistence data as well as the general knowledge of rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A from other licensed vaccines, a justification for the absence of investigation of one vs two doses in toddlers was requested. The applicant explained that no other vaccination schedules have been tested in toddlers since MenQuadfi was evaluated compared to the current standard of care in the EU (MET51: Nimenrix) with the respective vaccination schedule of a single dose. The applicant argued that further investigations of other vaccination schedules are not necessary since non-inferiority to Nimenrix has been shown. It was acknowledged that non-inferiority of seroresponse has been shown compared to Nimenrix at D30. However, no long-term data is available. Given that rapid waning has been observed for other MenACYW vaccines, and no data exists that this does not apply for MenQuadfi, a general statement on rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A known from other vaccines was added in section 4.4. of the SmPC.

The studies evaluating MenQuadfi with a comparator vaccine all had a modified double-blind design. Only the vaccine administrator (preparation and administration of vaccines, no involvement in safety evaluation) was unblinded in these studies. This was considered necessary due to the different appearances of the vaccines. However, it was unclear what measures were in place to ensure blinding of the subject. The applicant explained that to ensure blinding of the subject, the route of administration was not discussed with the participant and evaluation of the safety reports was done by a blinded study personnel. Since it is unlikely that potential unblinding has an impact on the immunogenicity endpoints and from a safety perspective except for an increased frequency of solicited injection site reactions, no differences in safety profile are observed between the two study groups, no further concerns remained.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were in general comparable over all pivotal studies and specific aspects are adequately reflected. The eligible age of the subjects differs between studies resulting in population ranging from toddlers (12 to 23 months) up to older adults (≥ 56 years). Although the whole age range is adequately represented, the population of subjects previously primed with a meningococcal vaccine is limited. Primed subjects have only been included in two studies: Study MET56 included adolescent and adult subjects (15-55 years) previously vaccinated with a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine and study MET51 included toddlers who received a monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccination during infancy. In multiple European countries MenC vaccination is recommended for toddlers and later quadrivalent MenACWY vaccination for adolescents. No data for MenQuadfi are available from primed adolescents or adults previously vaccinated with MenC. Moreover, in study MET56 subjects who previously received quadrivalent MenACWY vaccination were included with the majority of subjects primed with Menactra, a vaccine that is not licensed in the EU. Only very limited data of subjects previously vaccinated with Menveo are available and no data of subjects previously vaccinated with Nimenrix. In addition, no data are available to assess the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC and will be addressed in the planned postmarketing studies.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 73/121

Overall, data generated in the EU is limited. Only one of the seven pivotal studies (MET51) and one supportive study (MET54) were conducted in the EU. Both studies included healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months. No EU data is available for children, adolescents or adults. From other (EU-licensed) meningococcal vaccines, it is known that the ethnic background and also the geographical region can have significant influence on the circulating serotypes and the potential degree of carriage. The impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on study results and their potential to limit the interpretation and applicability of the results, has also been addressed in respective ICH and EMA guidance documents (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/692702/2008). Different baseline seroprotection rates have been observed in the regions included in the developmental programme. An additional comparison of seroresponse rates in toddlers based on data obtained in study MET51 (EU) and study MET57 (Russia, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand) showed comparable seroresponse data despite baseline differences. Although no comparative data are available for subjects beyond the toddler age, presented data provided some reassuring evidence that immunogenicity of MenQuadfi derived from subjects outside EU can be extrapolated to EU subjects

Different comparators have been used in the presented studies. The comparators - Menveo and Nimenrix - chosen for toddlers, children and adolescents are both licensed in the EU and contain the same serogroups as MenQuadfi. On the other hand, the chosen comparators Menactra and Menomune used in adolescents, adults and elderly, are not considered optimal from an EU point of view. Both vaccines are not licensed in the EU and it would have been preferred at least some comparative immunogenicity data against an EU licensed vaccine in adults and elderly, which has been also addressed during a preceding scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015). It was also mentioned that Menactra is not a particularly good conjugate vaccine. Moreover, Menomune is a polysaccharide vaccine with generally known drawbacks regarding immunogenicity. As mentioned in the scientific advice, the assessment will focus on seropositivity and seroconversion rates rather than on non-inferiority against Menactra or Menomune (although meeting non- inferiority would still be expected). Consequently, the assessment in adolescents (10-17) was also focused on the comparison against Menveo in study MET50. The applicant submitted a network meta-analysis comparing the immunogenicity of MenACYW in adult and elderly subjects to Menveo by extrapolation from historical studies of the corresponding comparator vaccines (Menactra, Menomune) with Menveo. However, as stated by the applicant, the analysis has several methodological shortcomings leaving a large margin of uncertainty. Consequently, the results were not considered conclusive.

The immunogenicity of MenQuadfi has also been studied in combination with different concomitant vaccinations (MET50, MET57). In toddlers, concomitant vaccination with MMR, Varicella, hexavalent vaccine (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) and PCV13 (pneumococcal vaccine) (MET57) and in adolescents, concomitant vaccination with TdaP and HPV was investigated (MET50). Although both studies were conducted outside the EU, all used concomitant vaccinations are also licensed in the EU. The obtained results are therefore relevant for the EU population. Nevertheless, it was not considered straightforward to extrapolate data from one particular vaccine to all vaccines containing the same antigens. Notably, variable enhancement or depression of immune responses to conjugated saccharides has been observed when the carrier proteins for co- administered products are the same or different, so that generalisations cannot be made beyond the specific vaccines studied as also stated in the respective EMA guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1). The SmPC was revised accordingly.

Initially no Statistical Analysis Reports were submitted. Corresponding documents were provided on request. Protocol amendments occurred in all studies, except MET51 and were mainly clarifications and updates of logistical issues or amendments concerning the addition of hSBA immunogenicity on the request of CBER/FDA. In study MET43 non GCP conform findings have been made at one study site. Affected subjects were excluded from the analysis, and results of respective sensitivity analyses showed no apparent

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 74/121

differences in immune responses across the treatment groups. A GCP inspection was performed in 2019 for this study by the FDA together with study MET35. The final report is still pending but based on preliminary report,s no inspection findings were identified. Further, a routine GCP inspection for study MET57 was performed in Q1 2020 by EMA. No critical findings were identified. Some major findings were identified but it is not likely that the observed findings have an effect on the reported data. With the exception of underreporting of certain AEs at site #402 (local reaction at injection site within 30 minutes), for which the sponsor provided adequate corrective actions and the CSR was updated in May 2020.

The applicant presented an elaborate multiple testing strategy for the conclusion of superiority across serogroups and age strata, which is partly motivated by epidemiological arguments. Nevertheless, post-hoc the potential risk for erroneous conclusions cannot be quantified. Consequently, the applied methods were not considered adequate. Furthermore, it was not considered straightforward to use seroprotection rates for superiority testing instead of seroresponse rates that were used for NI-testing. However, no concerns were raised as these results were considered supportive only.

Efficacy data and additional analyses

In six of the seven pivotal studies, antibody response of MenQuadfi was compared to different comparators (Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, Menomune) in different age groups from toddlers of 12 - 23 months to adults ≥56 years. In all these studies the primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of MenQuadfi against the comparator vaccine was met for all serogroups. In all but one study non-inferiority was based on seroresponse rates. Only in study MET51 non-inferiority of seroprotection rate was tested. Upon request, an additional non-inferiority analysis of seroresponse was provided where non-inferiority was also met for all serogroups.

The applicant presented a post-hoc testing strategy for the conclusion of superiority across serogroups and age strata. Although partly motivated by epidemiological arguments, the potential risk for erroneous conclusions cannot be quantified and the applied methods were not considered adequate. Consequently, these results were considered supportive only.

In general, it was observed that seroresponse and seroprotection rates were higher in younger subjects (toddlers, children and adolescents) and declined with age. However, this was not unexpected and was also observed in the comparator groups. Across studies and age groups, MenQuadfi seroresponse rates for serogroup A were lower compared to C, W and Y.

In meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects seroresponse rates were even higher for MenQuadfi for all serogroups in all age groups compared to the comparators with only some exceptions such as for serogroup A in toddlers where the seroresponse rate was lower compared to that of Nimenrix, while still meeting non- inferiority criteria for seroprotection. For children the seroresponse rates for serogroup A were numerically higher than for Menveo, but the difference is marginal.

However, subgroup analyses for MenC-primed toddlers revealed significant differences for serogroup A between MenQuadfi and Nimenrix in favour of Nimenrix. While seroresponse rates for serogroups W, C and Y were comparable or even slightly higher for MenQuadfi compared to Nimenrix, the seroresponse rate for serogroup A was significantly lower for MenQuadfi: 76.1% (69.6; 81.9) vs 90.8% (83.3; 95.7). The same was also observed for serogroup A post vaccination GMTs in MenC-primed toddlers: 31.8 (26.5; 38.1) vs 64 (50.9; 80.5). This observation is mainly driven by higher seroresponse rates and GMTs observed after the

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 75/121

administration of Nimenrix. Overall, seroresponse rates were comparable between MenC-primed and meningococcal-vaccination-naïve toddlers receiving MenQuadfi.

However, distinct differences were observed depending on the previously received MenC vaccination conjugate protein (TT or CRM). In the MenQuadfi group, seroresponse rates for serogroups A and W were distinctly lower for MenC-CRM primed subjects than for MenC-TT primed subjects with non-overlapping CIs (A: 50.0% (35.2; 64.8) vs 84.6% (77.7; 90.0); W: 44.7% (30.2; 59.9) vs 85.2 (78.5; 90.5)). Such differences were not as pronounced in the control group (Nimenrix) with only numerically lower seroresponse rates. Although the results should be interpreted cautiously, since the study was not powered for this subgroup analysis and the number of subjects in the respective subgroups is low (MenC-CRM: (MenQuadfi 48, Nimenrix 25), it has to be noted that this difference has not been observed with Nimenrix. Overall, an impact of the conjugate used for priming cannot be ruled out and respective amendments to the SmPC were made in order to include warnings for subjects at high risk for a MenA infection who previously received a Men-C-CRM vaccination.

An analysis of seroresponse rate in primed toddlers according to the number of doses (1 or 2) of previous MenC vaccination (NeisVac-C) showed lower response for subjects with one priming dose with slightly overlapping CIs for MenQuadfi. This was not observed for Nimenrix. However, seroprotection rates were comparable across all subgroups.

In quadrivalent meningococcal primed adolescents and adults the analyses of seroresponse rates and GMT according to previous vaccination (Menactra, Menveo or unknown) did not reveal any concerns. However, the number of patients previously vaccinated with Menveo were limited and need therefore be interpreted cautiously.

For meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects it was observed across studies that seroresponse rates were lower in subjects with seroprotective titres at baseline. Interestingly, this was not observed in meningococcal- primed subjects.

It has been also noted in general that baseline seroprotection rates for serogroup A were much higher than for all other serogroups but differed between studies. As mentioned above this issue was addressed by the applicant by a comparison of seroresponse rates in toddlers based on data obtained in study MET51 (EU) and study MET57 (Russia, Mexico, South Korea and Thailand) which showed comparable seroresponse data despite baseline differences. Further, considering the balanced randomization and stratification by country and, most important, the definition of seroresponse, no further concerns arised.

In study MET56 non-inferiority of seroresponse rates was demonstrated for MenQuadfi when administered as booster vaccination to subjects (adolescents and adults) who previously received a quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years before, compared to Menactra with even (numerically) higher seroresponse rates and GMTs for all serotypes in favour of MenQuadfi. As most subjects previously received Menactra, a concern was raised in how far data mainly derived from subjects who previously received a vaccine not licensed in the EU can be extrapolated to the European population. Furthermore, no data from adults and adolescents who were primed with a MenC vaccine were available. However, data from the toddler study are reassuring to some degree that MenQuadfi can elicit a sufficient immune response in subjects primed with EU-licensed vaccines. As there is no clinically plausible reason to assume that there might be a difference between toddlers and older age groups, this issue was considered resolved. Furthermore, additional data will be gathered in the postmarketing by the planned/ongoing studies. Additionally, it would have been informative to compare boosting between subjects that have been primed with different conjugates, as also recommended by the WHO. Available data from study MET56 didn't allow meaningful

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 76/121

evaluation in this regard, since mainly Menactra primed subjects were included. As mentioned above, in toddlers some differences were observed depending on the piming vaccine. Although these data had some limitations due to the low number of subjects in the subgroups, this observation should be described in the SmPC. Respective amendments were made.

In addition, no data are currently available to assess the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself. This is planned for the postmarketing, which was considered acceptable. The planned studies have been included in Annex II. Concomitant vaccination: Study MET57 investigated the immunogenicity of concomitant vaccination of MenQuadfi with paediatric vaccines (MMR+V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13). Although the study was performed outside of the EU, the used concomitant vaccinations are also licensed in the EU. Seroresponse rates achieved with MenQuadfi alone compared to concomitant vaccination with MMR+V and DTaP-IPV-HB- Hib do not give rise to concern on concomitant vaccination. Results didn't suggest a negative effect of MenQuadfi on the immunogenicity of the concomitantly administered vaccines. However, the clinical relevance of rather low seroresponse rates and significantly lower GMTs for serogroup A when MenQuadfi is concomitantly administered with PCV13 for both seronegative and seropositive subjects at baseline, was unclear (seroresponse rate S+ and S -: 56.1% (48.9; 63.2) vs. 71.9% (61.8; 80.6); seroresponse rate S+: 37.5% (27.8; 48.0) vs. 57.7% (43.2; 71.3); GMT: 24.6 (20.2; 30.1) vs. 49.0 (36.8; 65.3). In consequence, a respective warning for subjects at high risk for a MenA infection was included in the SmPC.

Study MET50 investigated concomitant vaccination of MenQuadfi and TdaP and HPV in adolescents. While no concerns arised for Tetanus, Diphterie and HPV, the concomitant vaccination had negative consequences on the immune response to pertussis antigens, as shown by non-inferiority analysis of GMCs. The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs in Group 3 (MenQuadfi+TdaP+HPV) and Group 4 (TdaP+HPV) was >2/3 in only one (PT) of the 4 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM). Even though the clinical consequences of a decreased immune response for 3 of 4 pertussis antigens was not entirely clear, and similar observations were reported for other meningococcal vaccines, this result was considered relevant for practical use and thus, has been providedin the product information. This effect was not observed in other studies addressing concomitant vaccinations with vaccines containing Pertussis antigens (MET57 and MET28 (supportive)). However, the administered vaccines differed between studies as did the age of study subjects (adolescents, toddlers and infants).

Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated in study MET43 for all three lots based on hSBA GMTs. However, significant differences between lot 1 and lot 2 were observed in terms of seroresponse rate against serogroup A (difference of -5.4; 95% CI: - 9.59; - 1.16). While GMT was considered more sensitive to detect differences between lots, this finding raised the concern whether the chosen equivalence criteria for the primary analysis based on GMTs were adequate. The applicant argued that no concern regarding a potentially relevant difference in terms of immunogenicity between lots should be raised as "the 95% CIs between the two study groups overlap (73.5; 79.4 vs 67.9; 74.2) even with large sample size around 800 per lot." However, for the comparison of averages between groups the confidence interval around the estimate of the between group difference was a more sensitive approach (due to the more efficient variance estimate) and therefore the relevant procedure for the conclusion of equivalence. While formally meeting the equivalence margin of +- 10%, the result may indicate a significant difference in serorespones rates, and the lower CI limit is very close to the pre-defined margin. It was acknowledged that this was a secondary analysis and that the primary equivalence objective was met. Furthermore, there were no concerns regarding inconsistency between lots from a quality assessment perspective. In addition, the applicant provided upon request results from a re-analysis of pre-/post-vaccination titres using an ANCOVA type model. The presented model adjusted comparisons of post-vaccination titres between lots of MenACYW for differences in baseline titre between subjects. Estimates of two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the average log difference do not

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 77/121

exceed -0.105 or 0.138 (corresponding to titre ratios of 0.78 and 1.37) and therefore meet an equivalence margin excluding larger that two-fold differences in post-vaccination titre between lots. In contrast to the results from an analysis of lot to lot consistency with regard to seroprotection, no confidence interval excludes 0 (i.e. no difference in post-vaccination titre between lots)

The applicant initially claimed the following indication for MenQuadfi: "MenQuadfi is indicated for active primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated for use in individuals 12 months of age and older." However, including the wording "primary and booster" immunisation was not considered appropriate. Some amendments were therefore required also to be consistent with both comparable quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines already approved in the EU (Menveo since 2010 and Nimenrix since 2012). The applicant proposed the new indication: "MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y." This proposal was considered acceptable.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy

The paediatric population (older than 12 month of age) is part of the marketing authorization application. The presented respective studies are already assessed in other parts of the report. Please refer to the assessment of studies:

MET51 for toddlers: 12-23 months

MET35 for children: 2-9 years

MET57 for toddlers 12-23 months

MET54 toddlers 12-23 months Met32 toddlers of 12 months +- 21 days MET28 infants 2 months + 28 days and toddlers 12 -< 19months

2.5.3. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In all main clinical studies, the primary endpoints were met and non-inferior immunogenicity of MenQuadfi 30 days after vaccination against different comparators across age groups was demonstrated for all serogroups in all age groups except for serogroup A in the subgroup of MenC-primed toddlers. Overall, immunogenicity of MenQuadfi across age groups has been sufficiently demonstrated.

Important missing information is long-term persistence of immunogenicity beyond 30 days as well as the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself, which will be addressed in the postmarketing studies, reflected in Annex II as category I post-marketing obligations.

2.6. Clinical safety

Patient exposure

There was a total of 7116 subjects who received any formulation of MenACYW conjugate vaccine in the completed 11 clinical studies (209 subjects in the Phase I study, 1494 subjects in the Phase I/II and II studies, and 5413 subjects in the Phase III studies). 6398 subjects received a single dose of the final formulation of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (alone [5417 subjects] or with at least one concomitant vaccine [981 subjects]) in the 9 studies supporting the Summary of Clinical Safety.

Of the 5417 subjects, there were 691 toddlers, 498 children 2 through 9 years, 1897 adolescents 10 through 17 years, 1684 adults 18 through 55 years, 298 older adults 56 through 64 years, and 349 elderly adults 65 years and older) receiving a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine given alone and included in the SafAS.

Solicited Reactions

Solicited Injection Site Reactions

For toddlers 12 through 23 months of age, the percentage of subjects with solicited injection site reactions after meningococcal vaccine injection was comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and the Nimenrix group (56.4% and 57.6%, respectively). The percentage of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 injection site reaction was low and comparable between the 2 groups (4.5% and 3.8%, respectively). The most commonly reported solicited injection site reactions were erythema and tenderness in both groups.

Modified from 5.3.5.3 Integrated Summary of Safety Report Table 3.1.6, and Table 3.1.1.

MenC-primed toddlers the frequency of solicited reactions tended to be higher in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (70.4%) compared to those who received Nimenrix (60.8%). While the rates are comparable in MenC-CRM primed toddlers between Nimenrix and MenQuadfi, in MenC-TT primed toddlers solicited reactions tend to be reported with higher frequency in the MenQuadfi group (66.9% vs 55.3%). The percentage of subjects experiencing any Grade 3 solicited injection site reaction or systemic reaction remained low after MenACYW conjugate vaccine (2.5% and 4.4%, respectively). The frequency of solicited reactions, particularly injection site reactions, tended to be lower in MenC-primed toddlers (70.4%) than in meningococcal vaccine-naïve toddlers (80.9%) after administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine. The same observation applied to subjects who had received Nimenrix (60.8% and 81.6%, respectively). There were no immediate AEs, no discontinuations due to an SAE or other AE, no deaths, and no related SAEs. One unrelated AESI was reported following administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine: this case corresponded to post-traumatic seizure (subject accidently fell of his cradle).

For children 2 through 9 years of age, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions tended to be lower in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (46.8%) than in the Menveo group (53.9%). There was a lower percentage of subjects in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group experiencing Grade 3 injection site reactions (3.7%) compared to the Menveo group (11.1%). The same observations were made for children 2 to 5 years of age and for children 6 to 9 years of age. In addition, similar percentages of subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions were observed in children 2 to 5 years of age and in children 6 to 9 years of age following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection. Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction in children, followed by erythema, irrespective of the age group considered (2 through 9 years of age, 2 through 5 years of age, and 6 through 9 years of age).

For adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited injection site reactions were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (40.2%) and the corresponding comparator vaccine groups, Menactra (43.0%) and Menveo (45.7%). The percentage of subjects experiencing Grade 3 injection site reactions was low in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Menactra, and Menveo groups (1.8% to 2.2%). Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction.

For adults 18 through 55 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited injection site reactions were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (43.4%) and Menactra group (43.7%). The percentage of subjects experiencing Grade 3 injection site reactions was low in both vaccine groups (2.1% and 2.2%). Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction.

In the older adults (56 through 64 years of age) and elderly adults (65 years of age and older) the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were higher in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group compared to the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (38.0% versus 17.0% for older adults 56 through 64 years of age; 22.2% versus 11.8% for elderly adults 65 years of age and older). This difference was also observed in the 2 age subgroups, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and above.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 82/121

The observed rate at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site tended to be lower when age increases (38.0%, 23.3%, and 18.9%, in older adults 56 through 64 years of age, in elderly 65 to 74 years, and in elderly 75 years and above, respectively). The observed rate of solicited injection site reactions in all the older adults and elderly adults was also lower than the rates observed in the younger age groups and only a low percentage of subjects reported a Grade 3 injection site reaction. Pain was the most commonly reported solicited injection site reaction irrespective of the age group considered (older adults 56 through 64 years of age, elderly 65 to 74 years, or elderly 75 years and above).

Modified from 5.3.5.3 Integrated Summary of Safety Report Table 3.1.1 and Table 3.1.10.

In the age group of children 2 through 9 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (34.5%) and the Menveo group (37.0%). A low percentage of these subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction. The same observations were made in the age subgroups 2 to 5 years, and 6 to 9 years. Following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions was generally similar in subjects aged 2 to 5 years (30.9%) and in subjects aged 6 to 9 years (38.1%), except a higher frequency of headache in the 6 to 9 years age group compared to the 2 to 5 years age group (18.0% versus 7.0% of subjects). Of note, headache was also reported with a higher frequency in the 6 to 9 years age group compared to the 2 to 5 years age group following Menveo injection. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were malaise and myalgia irrespective of the age group considered (2 through 9 years of age, 2 through 5 years of age, and 6 through 9 years of age). Headache was also frequently reported in the 6 to 9 years age group.

In the age group pool for adolescents 10 through 17 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions were largely comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (45.9%), the Menactra group (50.1%), and the Menveo group (51.0%). A low percentage of these subjects experienced at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia and headache followed by malaise.

In the age group pool for adults 18 through 55 years of age, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions were similar in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (47.6%) and in the Menactra group (47.9%); the percentages of subjects with at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction were the same in both groups

(5.7%). The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by malaise.

In the pool of older adults 56 through 64 years of age, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited systemic reaction was higher in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (42.5%) compared to the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (29.6%). There were a low percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reactions in both groups. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by malaise.

In the pool of elderly adults aged 65 years of age and above, the percentages of subjects with solicited systemic reactions were largely comparable in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (30.5%), and in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group (25.3%). This was also observed in the age subgroups 65 to 74 years and 75 years and above. There was a low percentage of subjects experiencing at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction in both vaccine groups. Similar percentages of subjects reporting solicited systemic reactions were observed in elderly adults aged 65 to 74 years and in elderly adults aged 75 years and above following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia and headache, followed by malaise in the pool of elderly adults aged 65 years and above, and in elderly adults aged 65 to 74 years. In the elderly adults aged 75 years and above, the most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions following MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection were myalgia and malaise, followed by headache.

Non-Serious Unsolicited Adverse Events and Reactions

Immediate Non-Serious Adverse Events

Very few immediate adverse events were observed within 30 minutes after vaccination. None were observed in toddlers, children, older adults 56 through 64 years, and one event in elderly adults 65 years of age and older (dysgeusia).

In adolescents, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 immediate unsolicited AE assessed as related to vaccination (ie, immediate unsolicited AR) was 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.0% in the Menactra group, and 0.2% in the Menveo vaccine group. The most commonly reported immediate unsolicited AR was dizziness (5 subjects; 0.3%) in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

In adults 18 through 55 years, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 immediate unsolicited AR following vaccine injection was low (0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine and Menactra vaccine groups). The most commonly reported immediate unsolicited AR was dizziness (3 subjects [0.2%] in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 1 subject [0.2%] in the Menactra vaccine group). No safety concerns were identified from the review of these reports.

Unsolicited Non-Serious Adverse Events

The percentages of subjects in each age group reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and the corresponding comparator vaccine groups.

Unsolicited Reactions

The percentages of toddlers reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low and comparable between both vaccine groups (5.0% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 4.5% in the Nimenrix vaccine group). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious AR in both groups was diarrhea. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There were no subjects with Grade 3 unsolicited non- serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

The percentages of children 2 through 9 years of age reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low and comparable between both vaccine groups (2.0% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 3.4% in the Menveo vaccine group). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group were vomiting, and abdominal pain (upper) for subjects 2 through 5 years of age, and injection site bruising for subjects 6 through 9 years of age. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. One subject in each group (0.2%) reported a Grade 3 non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination.

The percentages of adolescents with at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Menactra, and Menveo groups: 3.1%, 1.3%, and 3.4%, respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs included injection site pruritus, injection site warmth, dizziness, and nausea. Overall, the majority of unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion (≤ 1.3%) of subjects experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination across all vaccine groups.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 86/121

In adults 18 through 55 years of age the percentages of adults reporting at least 1 unsolicited non- serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low and comparable between MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (2.2%) and the Menactra group (2.4%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were injection site pruritus and injection site warmth (at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site), fatigue, nausea, and dizziness. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion (≤ 0.6%) of subjects experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in both the vaccine groups.

In older adults 56 through 64 years of age the percentages of older adults reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination were low: 3.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 1.6% in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 group. The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were injection site pruritus (at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site), injection site bruising (at the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 site), and fatigue. Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was a low proportion (0.3%) of older adults experiencing Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs within 30 days of vaccination in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

In elderly adults 65 years of age and older the percentages of elderly adults with at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR were low in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (5.2%) and the Menomune - A/C/Y/W- 135 vaccine group (2.6%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs was injection site pruritus (2.3% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.7% in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 group). Overall, most of the unsolicited non-serious ARs were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity, most started and resolved within 3 days of vaccination. There was only 1 subject (0.3%) in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 group and no subjects in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group who experienced a Grade 3 unsolicited non- serious AR within 30 days of vaccination.

Concomitant vaccines

A total of 392 adolescents received a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with Tdap + HPV in Study MET50, and 296 adolescents received Tdap + HPV alone.

A total of 589 toddlers received a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered concomitantly with a licensed paediatric vaccine (MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13) in Study MET57, and 294 toddlers received MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13 vaccines alone.

Solicited Reactions

In toddlers, the percentages of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction at any vaccination site within 7 days post-vaccination were comparable when MMR + V or DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccines were given with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine. This percentage was higher in subjects who received PCV13 concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine (31.5%) compared to subjects who received PCV13 without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (13.1%). Grade 3 injection site reactions were reported at a similar frequency in subjects who received the concomitant vaccines with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

The percentages of adolescents who reported at least 1 solicited injection site reaction were comparable between subjects who received the licensed Tdap and HPV vaccines with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (84.5% and 82.4%, respectively). At the MenACYW conjugate vaccine injection site, the percentages of subjects were higher in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and HPV (49.0%) versus subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (40.2%). Also Grade 3 injection site reactions at the MenACYW conjugate vaccine site were slightly higher in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and HPV (2.8%) as compared to subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (1.8%). Pain was the most common solicited injection site reaction for MenACYW conjugate vaccine, Tdap, and HPV vaccines in both groups, with 2.3% of subjects who experienced Grade 3 injection site pain for MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 89/121

The percentage of adolescent subjects who reported at least 1 solicited systemic reaction were higher in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine concomitantly with Tdap and HPV (70.6%) versus subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone (45.9%) and slightly higher versus subjects who received Tdap and HPV alone (65.9%). Slightly more subjects reported at least 1 Grade 3 systemic reaction in the MenACYW+ Tdap + HPV (7.5%) compared to the Tdap + HPV vaccine groups (5.5%) or the MenACYW alone group (4%). Myalgia was the most commonly reported solicited systemic reaction, followed by headache and malaise.

Unsolicited Non-Serious Adverse Reactions

In toddlers 12 to 23 months of age, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 unsolicited non- serious AR was low when MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13 vaccines were given concomitantly with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (≤ 2.1%).

The percentage of adolescents reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR were slightly higher when Tdap and HPV were given concomitantly with MenACYW conjugate vaccine than when Tdap and HPV were given without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (8.7% and 4.1%, respectively) or when MenACYW was given alone (3.1%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were injection site pruritus, injection site bruising, nausea, and vomiting, which also occurred more frequently in the MenACYW/Tdap/HPV group compared to Tday/HPV given alone (except injection site bruising). The frequency of reported Grade 3 unsolicited non serious ARs increased when subjects were concomitantly vaccinated with HPV and Tdap (1.3%) and were also higher when compared to HPV+Tdap alone (0%). In particular grade 3 nausea and vomiting were more frequently reported when MenACYW was administered with Tdap+HPV (0.5% each, versus 0% for MenACYW alone). Dizziness was not reported more frequently than when MenACYW was vaccinated alone. The unsolicited non serious AR tended to be of longer duration when MenACYW was concomitantly administered with Tdap+HPV compared to Tdap and HPV alone (4-7days: 1.8% versus 0%, 8 days and more 0.8% versus 0.3%).

Serious adverse events and deaths

There were no deaths in subjects who received the MenACYW conjugate vaccine.

Serious Adverse Events

In each age group, the rates of SAEs were comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and the corresponding comparative control groups:

In toddlers: 0.8% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.3% in the Nimenrix vaccine group between D0 and D30; and none in any group from D31 to the end of the study.

In children: 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.2% in the Menveo vaccine group between D0 and D30; and 1.0% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.4% in the Menveo vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study.

In adolescents: 0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.0% in the Menactra group, 0.2% in the Menveo group between D0 and D30; and 0.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, 0.6% in the Menactra group, and 0.6% in the Menveo group from D31 to the end of the study.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 90/121


In adults 18 through 55 years of age: 0.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.4% in the Menactra vaccine group between D0 and D30; and 1.4% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.6% in the Menactra vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study.

In older adults 56 through 64 years of age: 0.3% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.8% in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group between DO and D30; and 1.3%in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 1.6% in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study.

In elderly adults ≥ 65 years of age: 0.6% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 0.3%in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group between DO and D30; and 2.3% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group and 3.0% in the Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine group from D31 to the end of the study.

None were considered related to MenACYW vaccination by the Sponsor or Investigator. All SAEs were collected up to D30 in studies MET44, MET51, MET54, and MET57, while in studies MET35, MET50, MET43, MET49, and MET56, SAEs were collected up to 6-month after vaccination.

Adverse Events of Special Interest

A total of 5 AESIs were reported in subjects from the active-controlled studies included in the integrated analysis and all corresponded to reports of seizures: 4 (N=5417) were reported in subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone and 1 (N=2990) was reported in a subject who received a comparator vaccine. None of the AESIs were considered related to study vaccination by the Investigator or Sponsor or reported within 7 days of vaccination. In subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone, AESIs were reported in one toddler (febrile convulsion), 1 adolescent (seizure), and 2 adults (status epilepticus and seizure). Temporal relationship for the febrile seizure case was inconsistent with causal association with vaccination. The other reports of seizures were confounded by the subject's underlying condition or had an alternative cause.

There were no reports of Kawasaki disease, GBS, or idiopathic thrombocytopeniarpura in any of the studies among the subjects who received MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a comparator vaccine. As stated by the applicant, no confirmed cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after vaccination (this window is a commonly used post-vaccination period which may be consistent with vaccine associated GBS). However, subjects in Studies MET44, MET51, MET54 and MET57 were only observed for 30 days after vaccination.

Concomitant vaccines

SAEs and AESIs

In toddlers, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 SAE was low when MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB- Hib, or PCV13 vaccines were given concomitantly with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (≤ 3.2%). None of the SAEs were assessed as related to study vaccination and no deaths were reported. No AESIs were reported when MenACYW conjugate vaccine was given concomitantly with MMR + V, DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, or PCV13 vaccines. One unrelated AESI (febrile convulsion) was reported 22 days after vaccination with DTaP- IPV-HB-Hib vaccine alone.

In adolescents, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 SAE during the study was low and comparable when Tdap and HPV vaccines were given concomitantly with or without MenACYW conjugate vaccine (1.0% and 1.4%, respectively). None were assessed as related to study vaccination either by the Investigator or Sponsor and no deaths were reported.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 91/121

One subject reported an unrelated AESI (Grand Mal seizure) following administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine with Tdap and HPV vaccines. The case was confounded by the subject's underlying condition (history of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine).

Laboratory findings

Neither of the studies included safety laboratory evaluations as part of routine study procedures for the safety evaluation of MenACYW.

Intrinsic Factors

No apparent differences were observed in the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to the licensed vaccines when race and gender were considered.

The higher rates of solicited injection site reactions, including Grade 3 reactions, in toddlers and children are possibly confounded by the intensity scale used in these age groups. In these age groups, erythema/and swelling were of Grade 3 severity when above 5 cm while in the older age group they were of Grade 3 when above 10 cm. Also, in toddlers and children any erythema/ and swelling were collected and considered as injection site reaction; while in the other age groups, measurement had to be above 2.5 cm to be considered in the analysis. Overall, the rates were comparable between adolescents, adults, and older adults.

In elderly, a lower local and systemic reactogenicity was noted compared to the younger age groups; while the rate of SAEs was higher (as expected and remained comparable to that of Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 vaccine).

Extrinsic Factors

No clinical outcome data associated with extrinsic factors (eg, the use of tobacco or alcohol and food habits) have been collected in the studies included in the clinical development program. The potential interaction of extrinsic factors is not expected with vaccines.

Pregnancies during the studies

The following is the distribution of the 12 pregnancies reported in subjects who had received MenACYW conjugate vaccine):

- 7 unexposed

- 4 exposed, but not yet pregnant (injection received during the interval between 30 days before her last menstrual period (LMP) and 7 days after her LMP)

Immunological events

No specific analyses were provided, and evaluation of immunological events was part of the safety and efficacy documentation above.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Vaccination in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment may not elicit an adequate immune response.

Data on concomitant administration with other vaccines is integrated in the safety documentation above (MMR [M-M-RII], V [VARIVAX], DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib [Hexaxim/Hexyon/Hexacima], and PCV13 [Prevenar 13/Prevnar 13 were investigated in toddlers and Tdap [Adacel/Covaxis] and HPV [Gardasil] in adolescents).

Discontinuation due to adverse events

One subject experienced an AE that led to discontinuation among the MenACYW conjugate vaccine recipients. The parents of subject 301-05001, an 18-month old male, withdrew their consent due to a nonserious Grade 2 AE (Gastroenteritis) experienced by the subject on D0, and lasted 5 days after receiving MenACYW conjugate vaccine administered alone in study MET57. The event was considered as not related to the vaccine by the Investigator and Sponsor. The subject was treated and recovered from the event.

Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available for MenACYW conjugate vaccine as the vaccine is not yet marketed in any country.

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

The safety of one dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine (MenQuadfi) was evaluated in subjects aged 12 months and older (toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults including those 56 years and older). The safety was evaluated descriptively in eleven clinical trials: two phase I/II studies for selection of the final formulation and nine pivotal phase II/III studies investigating the to be marketed formulation. The safety profile of MenACYW was compared to the currently available and well characterised MCV4 vaccines Menveo and Menactra (in children 2-9 years, adolescents 10-17 years and adults 18-55years) and Nimenrix (in toddlers) as well as to the no longer available, unconjugated vaccine Menomune (in older adults; 56 years and older).

An integrated safety summary, summarised by age category and vaccine type, formed the basis of this full application, which was acceptable based on the similar design and conduct of the studies. MenC primed toddlers from Study MET51 were excluded from the integrated/pooled safety analysis, which was also acceptable based on different rates of solicited reactions, different number of MenC priming doses and time point of priming up to one month before study vaccination. Of note, MCV-4 primed subjects from study MET56 were included in the integrated analysis as priming occurred at least 4 to 10 years prior to study vaccination.

As regards the different types of vaccines used in children, adolescents and adults, it should be noted that only Menveo is an EU-licensed vaccine (Menactra and Menomune are US-licensed). Overall, 995 subjects received Menveo, among which 494 were children 2-9 years of age and 501 were adolescents 10-17 years of age, but none were adults. No concern was however raised on the use of only non EU-licensed comparator vaccines in adults for the following reasons: The two conjugated vaccines Menveo and Menactra are expected to show largely comparable safety profiles (despite containing a different amount of antigen and different carrier proteins). Indeed, only small differences in the safety profiles were observed between the different treatment arms that were considered not to influence the benefit risk conclusion (see results below). Further, adolescents and adults were expected to show comparable safety profiles based on mechanistic considerations, which was supported by the results (see also below). The unconjugated Menomune vaccine, however, has a lower reactogenicity potential than the other, more comparable, conjugated vaccines. Hence, the established safety profile in older adults (above 56 years of age) could only be indirectly compared to the safety profile observed in MenACYW vaccinated younger adults. Reassuringly, however, elderly overall reported less frequently AEs compared to younger adults (see below). Importantly, the safety assessments were considered appropriate and sufficiently similar across studies to allow pooling of the results by age group and by vaccine type. Therefore, a within treatment-group comparison by age group for the pooled MenACYW anaylsis as well as the between-treatment group comparison of MenACYW to Menveo and Menactra within the ISS was overall sufficient.

The overall safety database of MenACYW consists of 7116 subjects. 6398 subjects received the final MenACYW formulation in the 9 pivotal studies included in the safety analysis, thereof 5417 alone and 981 subjects with a concomitant vaccine. Out of the 5417 subjects exposed to MenACYW, there were 691 toddlers, 492 children (2 through 9 years), 1897 adolescents, 1684 adults, 298 older adults (56 to 64 years), and 349 elderly adults (65 years and above). The overall safety database fulfils the recommendations as set out in the Guideline for Vaccines (EMA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005) and was considered acceptable to support registration of MenQuadfi.

Safety analysis was stratified by age, gender and race. The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between vaccine groups. In toddlers there were more male (56.2%) than female

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 95/121

(43.8%) subjects in the MenACYW group. Most of the study subjects were white and not Hispanic or Latino, the number of subjects belonging to racial groups other than white (roughly 80%) or black/African American (roughly 10 to 20%) were underrepresented in the studies.

The method for safety collection was comparable across all studies and was in line with the EMA guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1), although different duration of follow up in the studies were reported. Immediate unsolicited adverse reactions were collected within 30 minutes after the vaccine injection. A diary card was used to collect all information about solicited reactions (injection site: pain, erythema, swelling, redness; systemic: fever, headache, myalgia, malaise) from D0 to D7 after vaccination and about unsolicited AEs/ARs (including medically attended adverse events; MAAEs) from Day 0 to Day 30 (Visit 2; V02). Serious AEs and MAAEs were collected during the entire study (1-month follow-up for studies MET 44, MET 51, and MET 54; 6 months- follow-up for studies MET 35, MET 43, MET 49, MET 50, Met 56). Adverse events of special interest (generalized seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Kawasaki disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura) were prospectively collected in toddlers in studies MET 35 and MET 51 and for other studies retrieved based on MedDRA coding.

Concomitant medications that might have influenced the study results were recorded in each study and summarized per Category (per study and vaccine arm). No notable differences were observed between study groups within the different studies.

The MedDRA coding version was updated during the course of the trials and the same version of MedDRA was not used to code AEs in all studies. Although the applicant was asked to indicate how the changes affected the tabulations, no details on the changes between different MedDRA versions were provided. The provided data in the pooled analysis include the solicited, unsolicited non-serious and serious AEs/ARs among all studies and all age groups, re-coded according to the last MedDRA version (21.0) available at that time.

The safety profile was comparable to the currently available EU- or US-licensed MCV4 vaccines Menveo, Menactra, and Nimenrix. The age cut-off used for older adults (56 years) was justified as since, at the time of study conduct, Menomune was the only licensed vaccine in the older age group 56 years and older in the US. As expected, in older adults, Menomune vaccinated subjects showed a less reactogenic profile than MenACYW vaccinated subjects. In particular, solicited ARs were reported less frequently in older (56 years and above) compared to younger adults (18 to 55 years), while a larger proportion of older adults reported unsolicited (injection site) ARs. These differences were reflected in the SmPC. The frequency of reported immediate unsolicited ARs (within 30 minutes after vaccination) was low in all age cohorts: no immediate AEs were reported in toddlers and children, while in adolescents 0.4% (7/1987), in adults 18-55 years 0.2% (4/1684) and in older adults 0.2% (1/647) of subjects reported immediate ARs in the MenACYW arm. These were mostly driven by dizziness. Dizziness was considered related and is reflected in the SmPC. There were no serious immediate unsolicited ARs (including any anaphylactic or life-threatening events.)

Solicited ARs within 7 days:

In toddlers, overall, solicited injection site reactions were reported by 56.4% of subjects in the MenACYW group and comparable to the Nimenrix group. The most reported local reactions were erythema (38.0%) and tenderness (37.8%), followed by swelling (19.4%). The number of Grade 3 reactions was low (4.5%) and comparable to Nimenrix.

Safety of 305 MenC primed toddlers was not included in the integrated safety analysis and presented separately. Compared to meningococcal vaccine naïve toddlers, solicited reactions tended to be reported with lower frequency in MenC-primed toddlers after the administration of MenACYW (70.4 vs 80.9%) or Nimenrix (60.8 vs 81.6%). In MenC-primed toddlers, solicited reactions, especially solicited injection site reactions,

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 96/121

tended to be reported with higher frequency in toddlers vaccinated with MenACYW conjugate vaccine as compared to toddlers vaccinated with Nimenrix. This was still in an acceptable range. While the rates are comparable in MenC-CRM primed toddlers between Nimenrix and MenQuadfi, in MenC-TT primed toddlers solicited reactions tend to be reported with higher frequency in the MenQuadfi group (66.9% vs 55.3%). Although the point estimate for solicited injection site reactions and systemic reactions tended to be higher in the MenACYW group, no statistical significance was reached, and the intensity of the reactions were mostly Grade 1.

In children, 46.8% of subjects reported solicited injection site reactions which was comparable to Menveo. Pain was reported most commonly (38.6%) followed by erythema (22.6%) and swelling (13.8%). Most of the reported solicited events were of grade 1 and 2, while the number of Grade 3 reactions for solicited events was lower in the MenACYW group compared to Menveo (3.7 % vs 11.1% respectively).

In adolescents and adults, the percentages of subjects reporting solicited injection site reactions following MenACYW vaccination were comparable (any intensity: 40.2% and 43.4%, respectively; Grade 3: 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively). Pain was most commonly reported (38.3% resp. 42.7%), followed by erythema (4.8% resp. 5%) and swelling (4.4 % resp. 4.3%). These events occurred mostly in the three days after the vaccination, were mainly of Grade 1 or 2 and there were no significant differences compared to Menactra or Menveo (including Grade 3 events).

A comparable percentage of older adults 56 to 64 years of age reported solicited injection site ARs (38%; grade 3: 1.7%). As for adolescents and adults 18-55 years, pain was reported most commonly (35.6%), followed by erythema (8.8%) and swelling (7.1%). These ARs were mostly grade 1 or 2 and most resolved within 3 days. In elderly subjects (65 years and above), injection site reactions were less frequently reported in the MenACYW group (22.2%, grade 3 0.9%) compared to older adults: pain 19.9%, erythema 5.8% and swelling: 4%.

Solicited systemic ARs:

In toddlers, overall, 64.5% reported solicited systemic reactions, which was comparable to the Nimenrix group. Irritability was most commonly reported (48.6%), followed by abnormal crying (34.5%), appetite lost (28.2%), and drowsiness (24.2%) with a similar pattern in the Nimenrix group. Most of the reactions were Grade 1 and 2, number of Grade 3 reactions was low and comparable (4.3% in both groups).

In children, 34.5% of subjects reported solicited systemic reactions, which was comparable to the Menveo group. Malaise was most commonly reported (21.1%) followed by myalgia (20.1%) and headache (12.5%). Most reactions were of grade 1 and 2 intensity, while the number of Grade 3 reactions was low (1.8%) and comparable to Menveo.

In adolescents and adults, 45.9% and 47.6%, respectively, reported solicited systemic ARs. Myalgia was most commonly reported (by 30.5% resp. 35.8 % of subjects) followed by headache (28.8% resp. 30%) and malaise (21.7% resp. 23.9%). Fever was reported by 0.8% and 1.2% of MenACYW vaccinated subjects, respectively. Most reactions occurred and resolved within the first days and were mostly Grade 1 and 2. Grade 3 reactions were overall low (4% resp. 5.7%, lowest for fever). There were no significant differences to the comparator arms Menveo or Menactra.

A comparable percentage of older adults 56-64 years reported solicited systemic ARs (42.5%; grade 3, 2.4%), while in elderly subjects, these were reported less frequently (30.5%; grade 3, 1.4%). Otherwise, the pattern was similar (most commonly myalgia, followed by headache and malaise, fever less frequently).

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 97/121

The reported local and systemic reactions were consistent with those expected after vaccine administration and are adequately reflected in SmPC section 4.8

Unsolicited AEs and ARs (within 30 days): In toddlers 54.7% of subjects reported at least 1 unsolicited non- serious AE, which was comparable to Nimenrix. The number of unsolicited adverse reactions was low (5%, no Grade 3). Most of the reported reactions belong to the SOC `Gastrointestinal disorders' with diarrhoea reported by 2.3% of subjects in the MenACYW conjugate group. Other preferred terms were mostly reported as single cases.

In children 23.9% reported unsolicited non-serious AEs, which was comparable to the Menveo group. The percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited non-serious ARs was low (2%). Most of the reported reactions belong to the SOC `General Disorders and administration site conditions' with reports of injections site bruising, crying and injection site warmth among others. Beside 'Gastrointestinal Disorders' including vomiting, upper abdominal pain and nausea, other preferred terms were reported as single cases. Most of the ARs were grade 1 or 2, 1 subject in each vaccine group (0.2%) experienced at least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccine injection. Overall MenACYW and Menveo groups were comparable.

For adolescents and adults 18-55 years, 19.2% of adolescents and 12.7% of adults 18-55 years reported at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AE in the MenACYW group, which was comparable to Menveo or Menactra. The percentages of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR (by SOC and PT) were low and similar for adolescents and adults (in the MenACYW arm 3.1% and 2.2%, respectively). This was also comparable to the comparator arms (Menveo or Menactra). The most frequently reported ARs were in the SOC 'General disorders and administration site conditions' and were most frequently 'injection site pruritus' and 'injection site warmth', followed by 'dizziness' and 'nausea' in adolescents and 'fatigue' in adults. The unsolicited non-serious ARs were mostly Grade 1 or 2 and mostly resolved within 3 days. Grade 3 unsolicited non-serious ARs were reported in a very low number of patients (<0.1% and 0.2%, in adolescents and adults, respectively, in the MenACYW arm).

In older adults 56-64 years, the percentages of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccination was comparable to adolescents/adults in the MenACYW group (3.4%). Similarly, the most frequently reported ARs were from the SOC 'general disorders and administration site conditions' (2.7% in the MenACYW arm) and mostly injection site pruritus (2%). Dizziness was not reported, and neither were nausea or vomitus. Only one grade 3 unsolicited non-serious AR (0.3%) was reported for the MenACYW group (i.e. chills).

In contrast, in elderly subjects (aged 65 years and older), slightly more subjects reported at least 1 unsolicited non-serious AR within 30 days of vaccine injection (5.2%) compared to the 'older adults' (3.4%) in the MenACYW group, respectively. As for the older adults, this was driven by the SOC 'General disorders and administration site conditions' (most frequently 'injection site pruritus'). Most unsolicited non serious ARs were of Grade 1 or 2 and most resolved within 3 days after the injection. No subject experienced Grade 3 unsolicited AR in the MenACYW group.

The tabulated summary of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated during the last round with the removal of the use of any threshold of frequency of occurrence of adverse reactions, thereby now also including AR's that were rarely (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) observed. Yet, the tabulated summary had previously already been outlined to show AR's occurring with a frequency of at least 0.1% (including only very common, common and uncommon AR's). The applicant explained the discrepancies and provided enough justification. All adverse reactions which were considered related to vaccination with a reasonable possibility were included, i.e. also including unsolicited adverse reactions or MAAEs considered related to

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 98/121

vaccination (e.g. urticaria, pruritus, rash,; for the complete list see related SmpC comment). The applicant clarified how the frequencies were calculated.

Serious AEs:

There were no deaths reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

Overall, the incidence of SAEs was low and comparable between MenACYW and the corresponding active control vaccine group: 0.8% of toddlers, 1% of children (mostly single cases in the SOC 'Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders'), 0.5% of adolescents (with comparable results for the concomitant vaccination groups, i.e. 1.0% and 1.4% for Tdap + HPV with and without MenACYW, respectively) and 1.6% of adults reported at least 1 SAE. These were mostly single cases with no evident pattern. None of these events were considered related by the investigator or sponsor. The narratives were provided and there is no indication of a causal relationship to the vaccine in any age group. The applicant was asked to discuss the different duration of follow up in the different studies and justify why safety data (especially SAES and AESIs) in toddlers were not collected for a 6-month period after vaccination. Difference in safety follow up duration were only based on the standard requirements for the US conducted studies. In all other studies safety endpoints were followed for 30 days; MAAEs and SAEs were followed up till end of 6 months post vaccination.

The number of AESIs that might potentially have been associated with MenACYW vaccination was low across the clinical development programme with reports in 4 subjects who received the MenACYW vaccine (febrile convulsion, temporal partial seizure). None of the events was considered as related, which is acknowledged. As stated by the applicant, no confirmed cases of GBS occurred within 6 weeks after vaccination (this window is a commonly used post-vaccination period which may be consistent with vaccine associated GBS). Subjects in Studies MET44, MET51, MET54 and MET57 were only observed for 30 days after vaccination. GBS should be included as a safety concern for the PSURs, but not the RMP.

No significant differences for MAAEs between treatment arms were noted in the individual studies. However, since some of these MAAEs were considered related to treatment by the investigator, the applicant was asked to provide listings, summarized by treatment and study, of those MAAEs that were considered related to the vaccination and discuss in how far they needed to be reflected in the SmPC . These MAAEs were summarised and the applicant clarified that the nature and frequency of those events were similar to the unsolicited adverse events and that therefore no particular advice should be added to the SmPC.

MCV4- primed subjects (aged 15 years and older) showed no notable differences to MCV4-vaccine naïve subjects (slightly more solicited injection site and systemic reactions in MC4-primed subjects [<10% difference in proportion of subjects], but no difference in grade 3 solicited ARs, unsolicited ARs or MAEEs).

Concomitant vaccines:

In study MET57 the safety profile of MenACYW was evaluated in toddlers with concomitant administration of different vaccines, including either DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib, MMR+V or PCV13. The frequency of reported AEs (solicited and unsolicited events) was in general lower, especially in Russian study sites where PCV13 was used as concomitant vaccine, than in studies MET51 and MET54 conducted in the EU, in the same age group. As there were fewer reports from the Russian study sites it is difficult to compare the results of the concomitant vaccines. The applicant discussed possible reasons for the low frequency of reported AEs in study MET57 and provided arguments, including a comparable low frequency across different study sites in Russia, possible influence by genotypic/phenotypic profiles and the cultural differences in medical practice in the Russian Federation against underreporting.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 99/121

Percentage of subjects reporting at least one injection site reaction or systemic reaction at the MenACYW injection site was comparable between the groups receiving MenACYW alone or in combination with either MMR+V or DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib (46.3%, 40.7 % and 44.5% and 54%, 46.6% and 51.3%, respectively). In subjects who received MenACYW + PCV13 the number was lower with 26.0% and 20%. Reporting of injection site reactions at any vaccine injection site was comparable with slight differences with or without MenACYW. In the PCV13 + MenACYW group the percentage was higher (31.5%) than in PCV13 alone (13.1%). Although the reports of injection site reactions and systemic reactions tended to be higher when PCV13 was administered in combination with MenACYW than PCV13 alone, the corresponding 95% CI were overlapping and the overall numbers with PCV13 were lower than in combination with other vaccines.

Tdap and HPV (adolescents): When MenACYW was concomitantly administered with Tdap and HPV vaccines, more adverse reactions were reported (including grade 3): approximately 10% and 25% more subjects reported solicited injection site and systemic reactions, respectively, compared to MenACYW alone (driven by myalgia and fever). Unsolicited ARs were also more frequently reported, especially injection site pruritus, injection site bruising, nausea and vomiting (still remained low, below 2%), and were of longer duration. When compared to vaccination of Tdap and HPV alone, solicited systemic (61.3 versus 55.4%) and unsolicited ARs (8.5 versus 4.1%) tended to be more frequently reported with the vaccination of the three components.

Although concomitant vaccination was tolerated without unexpected or serious safety concerns, more adverse reactions are generally to be expected with concomitant vaccination. The higher rates of adverse reactions in toddlers who received PCV13 given conconmitantly with MenQuadfi than in toddlers who received PCV13 alone was reflected in the SmPC.

Pregnancy and lactation:

Concerning the use of the product during pregnancy and lactation, data is very limited. Despite pregnancy being an exclusion criterion, 12 pregnancies were reported, of which one was considered 'exposed to the study vaccine when pregnant', four 'exposed when not pregnant' and seven as 'not exposed'. No pregnancy complications or cases of congenital abnormalities were reported in either category. Experience with the product from pregnant women is however limited, and women in their childbearing years will potentially receive the vaccine. The applicant will establish a pregnancy registry in the US to collect data on the outcome of exposure during pregnancy and to monitor for any potential safety signals that may arise. 'Use during pregnancy' was included as missing information in the RMP and the pregnancy registry was included as a Category 3 study in the PhV plan of the RMP. The applicant has committed to submit the final protocol of the pregnancy registry (MEQ00070) to the EMA in a next RMP update or in a stand-alone procedure. The applicant has also commited to provide a discussion on alternative EU data sources in case a signal is raised from the pregnancy registry or spontaneous reported data.

2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety

The nature and frequency of the reported adverse events are considered to be consistent with those expected after vaccine administration, are comparable as observed with the comparator vaccines and do not give rise to concern.

In conclusion, the safety profile of MenQuadfi is considered acceptable.

3. Benefit-Risk Balance

3.1. Therapeutic Context

3.1.1. Disease or condition

The applicant initially applied for the following indication:

"MenQuadfi is indicated for active primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated for use in individuals 12 months of age and older.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations."

The virulence of Neisseria meningitides is mostly based on the biochemical structure of capsular polysaccharides. So far 12 distinct meningococcal serogroups have been classified, with serogroups A, B, C, W, X and Y being responsible for most cases of meningococcal disease. Dynamics of meningococcal transmission, acquisition, and carriage in humans are a major influence on the incidence and likelihood of meningococcal disease and vary world-wide greatly among regions. The European population is mostly affected by serogroup B, but also C and Y have been reported. At present, the best prevention known against meningococcal disease is the up-front immunization with vaccines targeting the relevant serogroups.

3.1.2. Available therapies and unmet medical need

Meningococcal vaccines induce the production of bactericidal antibodies specific to the capsular polysaccharides of N meningitidis serogroups. In multiple European countries MenC vaccination is recommended for toddlers, even though the favoured timing of vaccination differs among countries.

MenQuadfi is intended to induce antibody production specific for serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.

Currently two quadrivalent MenACWY vaccinations are licensed in the EU: Nimenrix (since 2012) indicated for the immunization from the age of 6 weeks, and Menveo (since 2010) indicated for the immunization of children from 2 years of age, adolescents and adults.

Menveo is also available in the US but not Nimenrix. In addition, other MenACWY vaccinations are available in the US: Menactra is approved from infants as young as 9 months of age to adults 55 years of age, and Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135, a polysaccharide vaccine, which was licensed for persons 2 years of age and older at the time of the clinical trials. The production was discontinued in 2017 by the applicant (MAH of Menomune). According to the applicant, the decision was strategic and not based on any quality, safety, or efficacy issues.

3.1.3. Main clinical studies

For this MAA eleven clinical studies have been submitted of which seven were considered pivotal (MET35, MET43, MET49, MET50, MET51, MET56 and MET57). The remaining five studies are considered supportive evidence (MET28, MET32, MET44, MET54, MET39).

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 104/121

Six of the seven pivotal studies intended to demonstrate non-inferiority of seroresponse rates or seroprotection rates (MET51) following administration of MenQuadfi compared to different comparator vaccines (Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, and Menomune) in different age groups:

· Toddlers (12-23 months): MET51, compared to Nimenrix

· Children (2-9 years): MET35, compared to Menveo

· Adolescents (10-17 years): MET50, compared to Menveo

· Adolescents and adults (10-17 and 18-55 years): MET43, compared to Menactra

· Adolescents and adults (≥15 years): MET56, compared to Menactra

· Older adults (>56 years): MET49, compared to Menomune

Furthermore, lot consistency (MET43), booster dose (MET56) and administration of concomitant vaccinations (toddlers: MET57, adolescents: MET50) were investigated.

Subjects were meningococcal-vaccination naïve in studies MET35, MET50, MET43 and MET49. In MET51 both naive and MenC primed toddlers were included. In study MET56 subjects who previously received a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine were included.

Overall, the design of the presented studies was similar. In all studies, the subjects received one dose of MenQuadfi or a comparator vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated immediately before vaccination and 30 days after vaccination.

Primary analyses were conducted in the per-protocol analysis sets (PPAS) but the respective analyses have also been performed in the full analysis set (FAS) with comparable results.

In line with the relevant EMA (EMA guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1) and WHO guidelines (WHO Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines: regulatory expectations), it was agreed in a preceding scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/467602/2015) that no efficacy studies are necessary and that the clinical development programme of MenQuadfi is based on immunogenicity studies. This is based on the fact that a widely accepted immunological correlate of protection for meningococcal vaccines containing serogroups A, C, W and Y exists, which has also been applied in previous licensing procedures of conjugated meningococcal vaccines (e.g. Menveo, Nimenrix). The best established and scientifically proven correlate of protection against meningococcal disease to date appears to be hSBA titers ≥1:4. rSBA titers ≥1:8 are generally also considered to correlate with protection for MenACWY vaccines, although formally only correlated with effectiveness for serogroup C. Each assay has its merits and overall the serological assays together are considered appropriate to generate sufficient data to support the likely protective efficacy of the vaccine. The use of hSBA titres for primary immunogenicity analyses was adequately justified by the applicant and accepted in a previous SA. As supportive evidence, the applicant also provided data derived from rSBA for all patients in studies MET 50, 56 and 35 and for a subset of subjects in studies MET 43, 49, 51 and 57.

The main endpoints for the evaluation of immunogenicity were: seroprotection rates, seroresponse rates and geometric mean titers (GMTs). Seroprotection is defined as the percentage of subjects with an hSBA titer ≥1:8 while seroresponse extends this definition by taking into account prevaccination titers: For subjects with a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:8, an at least 4-fold increase of titer needs to be demonstrated. In addition, GMTs were presented for all serogroups, allowing the assessment of differences in immune response between

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 105/121

vaccines. Furthermore, percentages of subjects achieving an at least 4-fold increase of titres and reverse cumulative distribution curves of antibody titers (RCDs) were presented.

3.2. Favourable effects

The MenACYW conjugate vaccine is prepared by using tetanus toxoid as the carrier protein. Conjugation of polysaccharide antigens to a protein carrier can induce T-cell-dependent immune responses, which are anticipated to give rise to higher antibody titers, longer duration of the immune response, and enhanced immunologic memory that allows for a booster response.

All the core components of the MenACYW conjugate vaccine have been used extensively in licensed vaccines and have been shown to be safe. The meningococcal polysaccharides are the same as those used in Menactra (Meningococcal [Serogroups A, C, Y, and W] Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine), Menveo (Meningococcal [Groups A, C, Y, and W] Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate Vaccine), and Menomune - A/C/Y/W-135 (Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, Groups A, C, Y, and W) vaccines. The source of tetanus toxoid protein used as a protein carrier in MenACYW conjugate vaccine is the same as that used in ActHIB (a vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib]), as a carrier in the Hib portion of all Sanofi Pasteur paediatric combination vaccines containing Hib such as Pentaxim (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis [acellular, component], poliomyelitis [inactivated] vaccine [adsorbed], and Hib conjugate vaccine [DTaP2-IPV/Hib]), Pentacel (DTaP5-IPV/Hib), Hexaxim / Hexacima / Hexyon (DTaP, hepatitis B [HB], IPV, and Hib conjugate vaccine [DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib]), and as the tetanus component of the 2-component pertussis-containing combination vaccines such as Tetraxim, Pentaxim, Hexaxim / Hexacima / Hexyon. The safety of the combination of these components as they appear in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine has been evaluated in clinical trials conducted as part of the development program in the populations of the claimed indication (individuals 12 months of age and older: toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults including older adults and the elderly).

In all seven pivotal studies antibody response to MenQuadfi was compared to different comparators (Nimenrix, Menveo, Menactra, Menomune) in different age groups from toddlers of 12 - 23 months to adults ≥56 years. In all these studies the primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of MenQuadfi against the comparator vaccine was met for all serogroups. In all but one study non-inferiority was based on seroresponse rates. Only in study MET51 non-inferiority of seroprotection rate was tested. A requested analysis of non-inferiority of seroresponse was also successful for this study. The respective results for seroresponse and seroprotection are listed in the table below.

Seroresponse and seroprotection rates were higher in younger subjects (toddlers, children and adolescents) and declined with age. Across studies and age groups, MenQuadfi seroresponse rates for serogroup A were lower compared to C, W and Y.

In meningococcal-vaccination-naïve subjects seroresponse rates were higher for MenQuadfi for all serogroups in all age groups compared to the comparators with only some exceptions such as for serogroup A in toddlers where the seroresponse rate is lower compared to that of Nimenrix, while still meeting non-inferiority criteria for seroprotection. For children the seroresponse rates for serogroup A are only numerically higher than for Menveo.

In adolescents and adults, non-inferiority of seroresponse rates was demonstrated for MenQuadfi when administered as booster vaccination to subjects who previously received a quadrivalent meningococcal

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 106/121

conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years before, compared to Menactra with even (numerically) higher seroresponse rates and GMTs for all serotypes in favour of MenQuadfi.

Concomitant vaccinations: In toddlers, immune response to MenQuadfi and MMR and Varicella or hexavalent vaccine (DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib) was comparable for each vaccine when given alone or concomitantly. In adolescents, concomitant vaccination with TdaP and HPV revealed comparable results for Tetanus and Diphtheria antigens and HPV.

Lot-to-lot consistency was demonstrated in study MET43 for all three lots based on hSBA GMTs.

1) seroresponse was initially only included as observational objective; NI analysis was provided as requested

2) NI was tested for toddlers who either were meningococcal vaccine naïve or had received monovalent MenC vaccination during infancy (MenC-primed)

Although the cut-off for definition of hSBA seroprotection was ≥1:8, the applicant changed the cut-off for the definition of seroresponse in most of the pivotal studies from ≥1:8 to ≥1:16 (reaching an hSBA titer of ≥1:16 if <1:8 pre-vaccination or achieving a 4-fold increase in hSBA titer if ≥1:8 pre-vaccination) during the development programme. Higher titers as proposed by the applicant provide a more conservative approach and were thus considered acceptable.

According to the applicant's submitted data the methods were found to fulfil the set criteria for the different properties and are therefore regarded suitable for measuring clinical samples for documentation of immunogenicity.

3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects

Different cut offs for hSBA titers were used for the definition of hSBA seroprotection and hSBA seroresponse during the development (≥1:8 vs ≥1:16). Although the use of higher titers can be considered as more conservative approach, a clinical justification for the chosen NI margins was missing as well as a justification whether the chosen NI margins are equally applicable for the different definitions of seroresponse used

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 108/121

during the development. However, the chosen NI-margins were also applied in the development programme of other MenACWY vaccines licensed in the EU.

The chosen comparators Menactra and Menomune used in adolescents, adults and elderly, are both not licensed in the EU. In a preceding SA, it was stated that Menactra is not a particularly good conjugate vaccine. Menomune is an unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine with generally known drawbacks regarding immunogenicity.

Overall, data generated in the EU is limited. Only one of the seven pivotal studies (MET51) and one supportive study (MET54) were conducted in the EU. Both studies included healthy toddlers aged 12 to 23 months. No EU data is available for older subjects.

No immunogenicity data beyond 30 days after vaccination are available to determine immune persistence. From other licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines, rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A is known. Due to absence of any long-term data, it remains unknown if this would also apply to MenQuadfi.

In toddlers (MET51), differences were observed depending on the previously received MenC vaccination conjugate protein (TT or CRM). In the MenQuadfi group, seroresponse rates for serogroups A and W were lower for MenC-CRM primed subjects than for MenC-TT primed subjects with non-overlapping CIs (A: 50.0% (35.2; 64.8) vs 84.6% (77.7; 90.0); W: 44.7% (30.2; 59.9) vs 85.2 (78.5; 90.5)). Of note, the study was not designed to formally evaluate such differences and the number of subjects in the respective subgroups is low. In the control group (Nimenrix) only numerically lower seroresponse rates were observed.

Booster vaccination

Primed subjects have only been included in two studies: Study MET56 included adolescent and adult subjects (15-55 years) previously vaccinated with a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugate vaccine and study MET51 included toddlers who received a monovalent meningococcal C conjugate (MenC) vaccination during infancy. No data for MenQuadfi are available from primed adolescents or adults previously vaccinated with MenC. The majority of subjects in study MET56 previously received a vaccine not licensed in the EU (Menactra) (327/384 in the MenQuadfi group and 340/389 in the Menactra group). Additionally, data from study MET56 do not allow meaningful comparison of boosting between subjects that have been primed with different conjugates as also recommended by the WHO due to the limited number of subjects previously vaccinated with Menveo (48/384 in the MenQuadfi group and 39/389 in the Menactra group).

No data are available for MenQuadfi to boost itself.

Concomitant vaccinations

In study MET57, lower seroresponse rates and significantly lower GMTs for serogroup A, when MenQuadfi is concomitantly administered with PCV13 compared to MenQuadfi alone, were observed (seroresponse rate S+ (=seropositive at baseline) and S- (=seronegative at baseline): 56.1% (48.9; 63.2) vs. 71.9% (61.8; 80.6); seroresponse rate S+: 37.5% (27.8; 48.0) vs. 57.7% (43.2; 71.3); GMT: 24.6 (20.2; 30.1) vs. 49.0 (36.8; 65.3).

In study MET50 the concomitant vaccination of MenQuadfi and TdaP reduced the immune response to 3 of 4 pertussis antigens as shown by non-inferiority analysis of GMCs. The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of GMCs in Group 3 (MenQuadfi+TdaP+HPV) and Group 4 (TdaP+HPV) was >2/3 in only one (PT) of the 4 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM).

· Quality aspects:

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 109/121

Serogroup A differs from the other three serogroups C, Y and W135 in several basic aspects (e.g. binding to conjugate, process residuals). Additionally, dissociation rates of the conjugate differ between serogroup A and the other three serogroups. Free polysaccharide of serogroup A is elevated, compared to the other serogroups, in the accelerated stability study of the Drug Substance. In the real time stability study for the Drug Product, a higher increase of free polysaccharides can be observed for serogroup A in the course of time.

The applicant introduced a release specification of not more than 20% free saccharides and an end-of-shelf- life specification that allows 30% free saccharides. These specifications were not justified. At day 150, two studies were presented, reflecting immunogenicity data derived from a new batch (MET49) and an older batch (MET44). However, these data are not considered useful to further justify the specification limits. The definition of seroresponse differs between the two studies and makes any comparisons unfeasible. Furthermore, the actual amount of free polysaccharide is only known for serogroup Y in one of the studies and not known at all for the other study. For serogroup A, the applicant additionally justifies the proposed limit based on phase III lot results and stability trend analysis. This can in principle be accepted, however, the respective results do not support the proposed acceptance criteria for the other strains. The mouse immunogenicity data seem to confirm the applicants proposed specification limit. However, the unit of the ELISA data provided is not clear, considering also the fact that for serogroups Y and W135, the result doubled after 6 months under accelerated conditions.

It was acknowledged that the applicant has experience with other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines, but the data presented didn't fully justify the proposed specification limits of NMT 20% free PS for release and NMT 30% free PS for end of shelf life for MenQuadfi.

Clarification on the mouse immunogenicity data was provided upon request. An arbitrary value in MEU was assigned to the reference standard serum based on the dilution and absorbance in ELISA. The release specification for free polysaccharide is reduced to NMT 13 % and the stability specifications of NMT 30 % will be reassessed for all serogroups, which was considered acceptable.

The end of shelf life was claimed at 48 months. However, no stability data is available for 48 months yet. The currently available stability data for the drug product show clear signs of degradation of the Meningococcal Polysaccharide Serogroup A Tetanus Toxoid Conjugate after 36 months (3 batches; 15%, 15% and 17%) while after 24 months, the measured free polysaccharide content was below the LOQ. In order to justify the shelf life claim of 48 months, the applicant was asked to provide an update to ongoing stability studies, which was provided up to 42 months. Data of three lots of drug product was presented until the time point of 42 months. All parameters were inside the acceptance criteria. Since no data is available for the 48-month time point, the proposed shelf life of 48 months was not endorsed. The applicant revised the shelf life of the drug product form 48 months to 42 months as requested.

3.4. Unfavourable effects

The overall safety database of MenACYW consists of 7116 subjects. 6398 subjects received the final MenACYW formulation, thereof 5417 alone and 981 subjects with a concomitant vaccine. Out of the 5417 subjects exposed to MenACYW, there were 691 toddlers, 492 children (2 through 9 years), 1897 adolescents, 1684 adults, 298 older adults (56 to 64 years), and 349 elderly adults (65 years and above). Toddlers and subjects above 2 years of age are separately described in the SmPC based on different rates of solicited reactions, different number of MenC priming doses and time point of priming up to one month before study vaccination. Children, adolescents, adults (aged 18-55 years and above 56 years of age) were separately

Page 110/121


evaluated, but may be described integratively in the SmPC due to the comparability in design and conduct of the studies and the similar nature of reported adverse events.

In toddlers (12 through 23 months of age), 56.4% of subjects who received MenACYW and 57.6% of subjects who received Nimenrix reported any solicited injection site reaction. The most commonly reported solicited injection site reactions were erythema and tenderness in both groups. Among the subjects above 2 years of age, 41.3% of subjects reported solicited injection site reactions in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group, with pain (38.3%) as the most commonly reported.

In the age group pool for toddlers, the percentage of subjects who experienced at least one solicited systemic reaction was comparable between the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (64.5%) and the Nimenrix group (62.9%). The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were irritability followed by abnormal crying. In subjects above 2 years of age, the percentage of subjects who reported at least 1 solicited systemic reaction within 7 days of vaccine injection was 45.2% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. The most commonly reported solicited systemic reactions were myalgia (30.7%), headache (26.4%) followed by malaise (21.7%).

The rates of each of the injection site and systemic ARs were in general similar between MenACYW and the respective comparator vaccine, and the majority of solicited reactions were Grade 1 or Grade 2 intensity. The percentage of subjects experiencing Grade 3 solicited injection site or systemic reactions was low in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group (up to 4.5% and 2% experienced Grade 3 injection site reactions and up to 4.3% and 4.1% experienced Grade 3 systemic reactions in toddlers and in subjects above 2 years of age, respectively).

The percentage of unsolicited AEs reported by toddlers was 54.7% and in subjects above 2 years of age 20.7% in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. The majority of unsolicited AEs were in the SOCs of 'Infections and infestations' followed by 'Gastrointestinal disorders', 'Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders', and 'General disorders and administration site conditions'. In these SOCs, the most frequently reported PTs were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, injection site pruritus, rhinitis and fever, corresponding mainly to common respiratory or gastrointestinal ailments and infections.

The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 unsolicited AR within 30 days of vaccine injection was low in toddlers (5%) and in subjects above 2 years of age (2.8%) in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs were in the SOC 'General disorders and administration site conditions' (1.6%). The most frequently reported unsolicited non-serious ARs in this SOC were injection site pruritus (0.7%) and injection site warmth (0.4%) followed by fatigue, injection site bruising and injection site rash (0.1% each) reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. Other unsolicited ARs reported by at least 0.1% of subjects were diarrhea and dizziness (0.2% each), and nausea (0.1%) in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group. No unexpected ARs were identified.

In toddlers, the frequency of SAEs was 0.8% in the MenACYW and 0.3% in the Nimenrix vaccine group. Among subjects above 2 years of age, the percentage of SAEs were 0.4% in the MenACYW group. There were no noteworthy differences in the incidence of any preferred terms between the vaccine groups.

There were no deaths reported in the MenACYW conjugate vaccine group.

3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects

As regards the different types of vaccines used in children, adolescents and adults, it should be noted that only Menveo is an EU-licensed vaccine (Menactra and Menomune are US-licensed). Overall, 995 subjects received Menveo, among which 494 were children 2-9 years of age and 501 were adolescents 10-17 years of age, but none were adults.

Further of note, all adults above 56 years of age received either MenACYW (n=647) or the comparator Menomune (n=553), an unconjugated MCV4 vaccine that is no longer available (formerly US-licensed). A higher reactogenicity profile (in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse reactions) was observed after MenACYW compared to Menomune vaccination, which could possibly be attributed to the different pharmaceutical form. Hence, the established safety profile in older adults (above 56 years of age) is more reasonably indirectly compared to the safety profile observed in MenACYW vaccinated younger adults. Reassuringly, however, older adults showed a lower reactogenicity profile compared to younger adults (except for the unsolicited adverse reactions (mostly injection site ARs). The age cut-off used for older adults (56 years) was justified as due to the fact that at the time of study conduct, Menomune was the only licensed vaccine in the older age group 56 years and older in the US. Observed differences between older/elderly subjects and younger adults are reflected in the SmPC.

The adverse events table as presented in the SmPC seems incomplete and differs from the Menveo AE profile. It cannot be followed which adverse reactions (that were per definition related to vaccination) were considered irrelevant enough not to be mentioned in the SmPC (SmPC comment).

SAEs and any pre-specified AESIs should be collected from all trial subjects for at least 6 months after the last dose of assigned treatment, however, in toddlers and elderly there are no 6 months safety data available as the trial duration was substantially shorter.

In study MET57, the frequency of reported AEs (solicited and unsolicited events) was in general lower, especially in Russian study sites where PCV13 was used as concomitant vaccine, than in studies MET51 and MET54 conducted in the EU, in the same age group. As there were fewer reports from the Russian study sites it is difficult to compare the results of the concomitant vaccines.

Although concomitant vaccination was tolerated without unexpected or serious safety concerns, more adverse reactions are to be expected with concomitant vaccination. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.

Experience with the product from pregnant women is limited, and women in their childbearing years will potentially receive the vaccine. Therefore 'Use during pregnancy' is included as missing information in the RMP and a pregnancy registry was established.

No data is available concerning concomitant administration of MenQuadfi with MenB vaccines in adolescents. However, this is listed as missing information in the RMP, and the applicant will initiate a study to explore this issue.

There are currently only limited data on the safety of booster doses (810 adolescents and adults ≥ 15 years of age).

During the assessment of the non-clinical development the following concern arose: The fact that dark faeces were found in all cages of treated animals strongly suggests that this observation is treatment-related. It is unclear whether these findings may have been caused by a transient toxicological adverse effect (that was consequently not observed during later histological investigations). Considering that the relevance of the rat

repeated dose study for humans was doubted, it is unclear whether this finding also bears relevance for the clinical use of MenQuadfi.

3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion

3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

In all main clinical studies, the primary endpoints were met and non-inferior seroresponse rates or seroprotection rates, respectively, of MenQuadfi 30 days after vaccination against different comparators was demonstrated for all serogroups in all age groups except for serogroup A in the subgroup of MenC-primed toddlers. The applicant justifies the applied non-inferiority margins mainly based on precedence from other development programs, as well as feasibility concerns. A justification based on clinical considerations (e.g.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 116/121

relevance of a 10% lower seroresponse rate in terms of vaccine efficacy) or statistical considerations (e.g. assay sensitivity) is missing. Given the reference to other development programmes as well as the clear demonstration of NI against various comparator vaccines across studies this issue is not further pursued.

Although seroprotection is considered clinically relevant for the individual subject, seroresponse is considered more relevant for the immunogenicity assessment, especially since a rather high percentage of subjects with seroprotective titres at baseline was included in the submitted studies. In all but one study non-inferiority analyses were based on seroresponse rates. However, demonstration of non-inferiority in children was based on seroprotection rates. An additional analysis based on seroresponse rates was provided upon request and showed non-inferiority for all serogroups.

The lower seroresponse rates against serogroup A as observed with concomitant vaccination with PCV13 and the lower seroresponse rates against serogroup A in toddlers primed with a CRM-conjugate vaccine compared to a TT-conjugate vaccine are considered relevant to be described in the SmPC. Although the latter finding is based on data from subgroup analysis in a rather low number of subjects and should therefore be interpreted cautiously, this effect was not observed for the comparator vaccine. Especially for vaccinees at high risk for MenA infection, this information is considered relevant. Overall, an impact of the vaccine conjugate used for priming cannot be ruled out based on the presented data.

The investigation of long-term persistence data in the postmarketing is considered acceptable. Nevertheless, the absence of such data so far needs to be adequately stated in the SmPC.

From both other licensed quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines rapid waning of antibodies against serogroup A is known and is described in their SmPCs. Due to the absence of any data beyond D30 following vaccination with MenQuadfi, it remains unknown if this is also applicable for MenQuadfi or not. A general statement on this effect known from other licensed vaccines should therefore be added in the SmPC.

Declining seroresponse and seroprotection rates with age are not unexpected and were also observed in the comparator groups.

Several concerns have initially been raised whether the presented data are representative for the European population. Only two studies have been conducted in the EU and it is known also from other (EU-licensed) meningococcal vaccines, that a variety of factors can have significant influence on the circulating serotypes and the potential degree of carriage. A comparison of data from toddlers from studies MET51 (EU) and MET57 (Russia, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand) showed comparable seroresponse rates despite different seroprotection rates at baseline. Data for older subjects is still not available but the presented results for toddlers are reassuring.

The identified uncertainties concerning concomitant vaccinations have an impact on the SmPC wordings. This concerns on the one hand the observed differences (Pertussis antigens, PCV13). Even though the clinical consequences of a decreased immune response to 3 of 4 pertussis antigens is not entirely clear and similar observations were reported for other meningococcal vaccines, this result is relevant for practical use and thus should be provided in the product information. Concomitant use of MenQuadfi and PCV13 can be recommended but a respective warning for subjects at risk of MenA infections has to be included in the SmPC. On the other hand, this concerns extrapolation of available data into general recommendations in section 4.5 of the SmPC. It is not considered straightforward to extrapolate data from one particular vaccine to all vaccines containing the same antigens. Notably, variable enhancement or depression of immune responses to conjugated saccharides has been observed when the carrier proteins for co-administered products are the same or different, so that generalizations cannot be made beyond the specific vaccines studied and respective detailed information about the used vaccines have to be added to the SmPC. However,

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 117/121

the concerns on concomitant vaccination are not considered to affect the benefit risk balance. Upon request, these findings were adequately reflected in the SmPC.

For a comprehensive assessment of immunogenicity of MenQuadfi data on long-term persistence and on the ability of MenQuadfi to boost itself are necessary. The applicant plans to address this with three postmarketing studies, which are included in Annex II as category I post marketing studies.

The applicant introduced a release specification of not more than 20% free saccharides and an end-of-shelf- life specification that allows 30% free saccharides. Whereas the theoretical concern that an increased rate of free saccharides might cause hyporesponsiveness to further doses of conjugate vaccine will be investigated in the postmarketing by booster studies, there is still insufficient justification for the proposed end-of-shelf-life specifications. The release limits for free PS have been lowered to NMT 13%. The applicant commits to reassess stability specifications of NMT 30 % for all serogroups, which is acceptable.

The ability of MenQuadfi to boost other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines was investigated. However, as the majority of adolescent subjects previously received Menactra it is unclear in how far data mainly derived from subjects who previously received a vaccine not licensed in the EU can be extrapolated to the European population. Three postmarketing studies are planned for further evaluation of immunogenicity of MenQuadfi in primed subjects (included in Annex II). Furthermore, no data from adults and adolescents who were primed with a MenC vaccine are available. However, respective data from toddlers are reassuring to some degree that MenQuadfi is able to elicit a sufficient immune response in subjects primed with EU-licensed vaccines as well as in MenC primed subjects. As there is no clinically plausible reason to assume that there might be a difference between toddlers and older age groups, the postponing of further investigation in adolescents and adults to the postmarketing is acceptable.

The concerns raised concerning the stability of the conjugate could impact the intended shelf life claim of 48 months. So far (day 150), stability data have been provided until the time point of 42 months. All parameters tested meet the specifications. As no data is available for 48 months, the proposed shelf life claim of 48 months could not currently be endorsed and was revised to 42 months.

Overall, the nature and frequency of the reported adverse events are considered to be consistent with those expected after meningococcal vaccine administration. There were no serious or unexpected safety findings with a suspected causal relationship to the vaccine.

No concern is raised on the use of non EU-licensed comparator vaccines from a safety perspective for the following reasons: Comparative data to an EU-licensed vaccine are available in a proportion of subjects and both conjugated vaccines Menveo and Menactra are expected to show largely comparable safety profiles, despite containing a different amount of antigen and different carrier proteins. Indeed, only small differences in the safety profiles were observed between the different treatment arms that are considered not to influence the benefit risk conclusion. Further, adolescents and adults are expected to show comparable safety profiles based on mechanistic considerations, which was also confirmed by the results. In addition, the safety assessments are considered appropriate and sufficiently similar across studies to allow pooling of the results by age group and by vaccine type. Therefore, a within treatment-group comparison by age group for the pooled MenACYW analysis as well as the between-treatment group comparison of MenACYW to Menveo and Menactra within the ISS is overall sufficient. Reassuringly, older adults, in whom more adverse reactions were reported compared to Menomune, showed a lower reactogenicity profile when compared to younger adults. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC.

EMA/CHMP/452679/2020

Page 118/121

3.7.2. Balance of benefits and risks

From an immunogenicity point of view, the results are overall favourable. In all clinical studies the primary endpoints were met. There was even a trend towards higher seroresponse rates for MenQuadfi compared to other quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. Also, secondary endpoints do in general support the results from the primary endpoints. Nevertheless, some uncertainties remain but could be adequately reflected in the SmPC or addressed in the postmarketing.

The safety profile of MenQuadfi is considered acceptable.

The applicant initially claimed the following indication for MenQuadfi: "MenQuadfi is indicated for active primary and booster immunisation for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y. MenQuadfi is indicated for use in individuals 12 months of age and older.

The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with available official recommendations."

Including the wording, "primary and booster" immunisation, was not considered appropriate. Two comparable quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines are already approved in the EU (Menveo since 2010 and Nimenrix since 2012). The indication of MenQuadfi should be consistent with these other vaccines. Therefore, rewording of the indication was needed.

The applicant revised the wording of indication as follows: "MenQuadfi is indicated for active immunisation of individuals from the age of 12 months and older, against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, W, and Y." This wording is considered acceptable.

Taken together, MenQuadfi could be approvable in the revised indication.
