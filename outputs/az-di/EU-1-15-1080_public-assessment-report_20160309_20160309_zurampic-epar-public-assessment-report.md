2. Scientific discussion

2.1. Introduction

Problem statement

Gout is a chronic uric acid crystal deposition disease. It results from hyperuricemia, a metabolic disorder, which is mainly thought to be due to insufficient renal uric acid excretion, and to lesser extent a purine rich diet. Gout may be secondary to the intake of thiazide diuretics. Some families have a genetic predisposition, related to expression of uric acid transporter enzymes.

Hyperuricemia is defined typically as serum Uric Acid levels (SUA) > 6.8 mg/dl (> 400 umol/a on the solubility limit of uric acid. When SUA exceeds the solubility limit, this can lead to deposition of urate crystals in body tissues. These crystals can accumulate in and around joints, which may cause painful and recurrent attacks of inflammatory arthritis. Eventually, subdermal deposits called tophi can occur. Tophi may be small and symptomless, or large and bothersome, causing throne arthritis, malfunction of joints and rupture of the overlying skin ("leaking tophi"). Tophus forming in the kidney may lead to lithiasis and inflammation, and if uncontrolled, to renal failure.

Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis (Doherty 2012). prevalence of gout is

estimated as 1-2 % in Europe. Gout is primarily diagnosed in middle with a genetic predisposition of hyperuricaemia, however, may det topaceous arthritis at a young age. Women who develop gout

ged and elderly males. Patients severe gout and chronic general elderly using diuretics.

Common co-morbidities in gout are chronic kidney disorders and diabetes type 2, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular (CV) disorders and alcohol dependence. Gout and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is associated with an increased risk of OV death (loachimescu 2008, Kim 2008). Whether there is a causal relationship between hyperuricaemia and CV disease outcomes and hypertension is a matter of debate and not confirmed by interventional studies (Vinik, 2014).

Standard care of gout consist of urate-low g therapy (ULT). In addition, acute gouty arthritis flares are treated symptomatically with anarg

and anti-inflammatory drugs. The therapeutic goal in the management of gout is to lower sh orels with ULT below a target SUA of < 6 mg/dl (360 umol/L) at minimum, to durably improve the signs and symptoms of gout. According to several international guidelines, including those from the British Society for Rheumatology and the American College of Rheumatology, lower target SUN levels < 5 mg/dl (300 umol/L) are indicated for patients with tophi, as a larger gradient is required to obtain an adequate reduction in crystal deposition within a reasonable timeffande (hanna, Fitzgerald, 2012, Richette 2014). The target of 5 mg/dL is based on the median suA value of the general UK male population (Jordan et al, 2007).

include:

available for the prophylaxis of recurrent gouty attacks and reduction of tophi, which

(a sca xanthine-oxidase inhibitors (XOI), allopurinol and febuxostat, which decrease the de novo synthesis of urate.

(b) oral uricosuric agents probenecid, benzbromarone, and sulphinpyrazone. Uricosuric agents increase excretion of uric acid into the urine, by inhibition of transporters mediating reabsorption of uric acid by the kidney. Lesinurad also belongs to the oral uricosuric agents.

(c) intravenous pegloticase, a pegylated recombinant uricase. Uricase is an enzyme which converts uric acid to more soluble allantoin for renal excretion.

Initiation of ULT could actually induce an arthritis gout attack, as instability of crystals deposits due to a sudden drop of SUA, may trigger an inflammatory reaction. According to clinical treatment guidelines,

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 7/128

gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine or a NSAID is recommended in the first 3-6 months after starting ULT.

Approximately 40% to 80% of patients do not achieve recommended SUA goals with current first line XOI, and warrant additional treatment to control their disease (Schumacher 2008, Becker 2005, Becker 2010, Edwards 2009). Urocosic agents have their limitations regarding safety, and are not overall available in the EMA member states. E.g. benzbromarone is associated with hepatotoxicity. Probenecid causes multiple drug-drug interactions and has to be frequently dosed over the day, whereas sulphinpyrazone has been associated with rash and gastric bleeding. Pegloticase is highly effective, however, its use is limited to last line because of the risk of serious infusion reactions.

In conclusion, though several ULT options are available, there is a need for other effective ora with a favourable safety profile.

About the product

Zurampic is a solid tablet containing 200 mg of lesinurad. Lesinurad is an ulxcosunic Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT) that inhibits specifically Uric Acid Transporter 1 (URAT1) A11 is thought to be responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid front renal tubular lumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers SUA. In addition, lesinurad is an inhibitor of OAT4 (organic anion transporter), which is considered to be involved in hyperuricemia secondary to the use thiazide diuretics.

The initially proposed indication was "chronic treatment of hyperuricaemia in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat in gout patients when additional therapy is warranted (i.e. not at target serum uric acid levels or with presence of a tophus" in adults

The recommend indication is "Zurampic, in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated in adults for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout patients (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor".

According to the SmPC of Zurampic, e treatment target SUA level is less than 6 mg/dl (360 umol/L). In patients with tophi or persistent symptoms, the target is less than 5 mg/dl (300 umol/L). Testing for the target SUA level may be performed as early as 4 weeks after initiating Zurampic treatment.

The recommended dose of Nurampic is 200 mg once daily in the morning, to be taken with food and water. No dose adjustments are proposed for elderly, patients with mild-moderate renal impairment, and patients with heparin impairment. A statement has been included in the SmPC that Zurampic should not be initiated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL less than 30 mL/min).

Several pretattipary measures are recommended in the SmPC to prevent hyperuricosuria when using lesinurad, suchas sufficient hydration (2 litres of liquid per day), and morning intake. Zurampic must be taken at the same time as the xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) of choice (allopurinol or febuxostat), Sİ has been show that XOI reduce the urinary uric acid load and the risk of renal events of

Gout flare prophylaxis with either colchicine or NSAIDs is recommended for at least 5 months when starting lesinurad therapy, in order to reduce the risk of ULT-induced gouty arthritis flares.

route of synthesis

In accordance with article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC, New Active Substance status was claimed. The information provided in the dossier shows that lesinurad is not an isomer, mixture of isomers, a complex or derivative or salt of a chemical substance previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. Lesinurad is also not a chemical entity already used in a medicinal product. Therefore lesinurad is considered a new active substance from a quality perspective.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

The active substance is manufactured at three locations.

Lesinurad is synthesized in 3 synthetic steps. The commercial manufacturing process for the synthesis of the active substance was sufficiently detailed including quantities and operating conditions.

Starting materials have been adequately described and justified on the basis of the Reflection Paper on requirements for selection and justification of starting materials for the manufacture of chemical active substances (EMEA/H448443/2014). Sufficient information on raw materials, synthesis and specifications of lesinurad have been provided. Reprocessing consists of repetition of the regular process.

The process comprises 2 isolated intermediates and their specifications are acceptable based on the provided control strategy which is in line with ICH Q11. Critical quality attributes have been discussed, although the application is not a Quality by Design application. The critical steps have been adequately justified and critical parameters have been determined and described sufficiently.

The development of the control strategy for the manufacture of lesinurad followed a science an based approach. Analytical procedures which are considered critical for the quality of the a que substance and intermediate control have been adequately validated.

Thorough discussion of impurities (that have been divided into organic, inorganic / heavy metals, solvents and genotoxic) comprising several spike and purge studies show absele or control of impurities in lesinurad. The residual solvents are all class 2 and 3 solvents. Genotoxic / mutagenic impurities have been studied according to ICH M7 and their purge and cont Is acceptable.

The active substance is stored in double low density polyethylene (LPDE) bags individually closed with plastic tie wraps.

2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development

Not applicable.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction

Lesinurad is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that inhibits the uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1). URAT1 is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and therebyowers serum uric acid. Lesinurad also inhibits Organic Anion Transporter 4 (OAT4), a uric acid transporter involved in diuretic induced hyperuricemia.

The nonclinical safety profile of lesinurad was characterised in a testing program he that included assessment of primary and secondary pharmacodynamics (PD), safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) including drug-drug interaction (DDI) with major liver enzymes and liver/kidney transporters, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and a complete tovicplogy package to support the chronic administration of lesinurad in adult patients.

Scientific advice was received from the CHMP on 29 November 2010 and 1 April 2011. The non-clinical advice concerned the adequacy of the embryofetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits.

2.3.2. Pharmacology

Primary pharmacodynamic studies

The inhibitory effects of lesinurad on human URAT1-mediated transport of uric acid were studied in two independent experiments in Xenopus latvis oocytes. An IC50 of 52.5 M and 41 M was calculated. In human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing the human URAT1 transporter, lesinurad suppressed uptake of [14C] uric acid with an 50 value of 7.3 UM.

Both cis-inhibition (due to high quminal lesinurad concentrations in the proximal tubuli) as well as trans-inhibition (due to basolateral transport by OAT1 and OAT3) may contribute to the inhibition of uric acid transport h

When rat and mice URAT1 transfected cells were used, it appeared that lesinurad did not inhibit these rodent orthong at relevant concentrations (up to 100 UM).

Besides, (GURAT1, lesinurad also inhibits hOAT4 with an average EC50 value for lesinurad of 3.7 M. Hurar CAT4 (hOAT4) is a recently characterized urate transporter involved in human urate transport in the kidney. Human SLC2A9v1 and SLC2A9v2 (the GLUT9 transporter) located at the basolateral membrane of renal tubular cells, however, are not affected by lesinurad.

Lesinurad and its metabolites M1, M2, M3 and M6 were tested for potential inhibition of xanthine oxidase using either xanthine or hypoxanthine as a substrate. No inhibition of xanthine oxidase conversion of xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid was observed at relevant concentration. Similarly, no inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase was observed.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Considering the lower concentrations of the metabolites and the higher IC50 values for URAT1 and OAT4 of the metabolites M2, M3, M4 and M6, it is not expected that these metabolites contribute to the pharmacological activity of lesinurad.

The primary pharmacological activity of lesinurad was studied in the New World monkey Cebus apella (Brown capuchin). Urinary excretion of uric acid increased from baseline, suggesting that lesinurad likely shares the same mechanism of action as benzbromarone, although the presence of URAT1 transporter in Cebus monkeys has not been established. Serum uric acid levels did not change in animals treated with lesinurad or benzbromarone. At baseline, significant amounts of allantoin were detected in both plasma (mean concentration of 0.432 mg/dL) and urine (mean concentration of $7.6 mg/dL), suggesting the existence of uricase in Cebus monkeys, which significantly reduces the value of the Cebus monkey as an in vivo model.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies

Secondary pharmacological targets of lesinurad were assessed by measuring its ability (at 100 uM) to inhibit binding of radiolabeled ligands to 169 pharmacological targets that compris transporters, receptors, and enzymes. Ligand binding of 10 targets was inhibited more than Ovo and subsequently tested to obtain an IC50. The only ligands that were inhibited with an IC50

30 UM were the human prostanoid thromboxane A2 (TP) receptor and DP1 receptor. However, additional in vitro pharmacology data, ex vivo models, cardiovascular safety pharmacologyand toxicological studies indicate that lesinurad is not a functional antagonist of the arachideme acid biosynthetic pathway or of the major prostaglandin receptors in vivo. The evidence of wean. Otro activities, a lack of tissue- based activity, and the absence of relevant toxicity findings supratherapeutic dosing in chronic nonclinical studies indicates that there are no clinically relevent PD interactions with these pathways.

Other targets investigated included neuropeptide Y )4 and NPY5, which showed no clinically relevant inhibition from either lesinurad or the Memetabolite of lesinurad. A battery of nuclear receptors was also tested, and at the 100 um concentration of lesinurad only 2 fold activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPAR) y and weak inhibition (20%) of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) a was seen, and no signifiean activity was seen at ≤ 25 uM.

As lesinurad is a metabolite of RDLA 200, which is an HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) compound, anti-hiv activity was investigated. Lesinurad did not exhibit any clinically significant antiviral activity against HIV. Lesinurad was also tested for activity against the human DNA polymerases a, B, and y. The 1050 against human DNA polymerase a was 98.4 UM, while the IC50 against human DNA polymerases B and y was > 100 UM, suggesting little potential for toxicity by this mechanism.

The potentia totoxicity of lesinurad was evaluated by determining the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in HeLa-JC53 cells and the human HepG2 cell line. The CC50 value in HeLa-JC53 was 40AM, whereas the CC50 in HepG2 was above 100 UM. Furthermore, while benzbromarone and monadone (a positive control) were extremely potent at inducing mitochondrial toxicity, lesinurad was inaci've at clinically relevant concentrations. Yet, it should also be considered that HeLa and HepG2 cells have only limited metabolic activity and therefore insufficiently cover any potential role of metabolites (see also discussion on DILI in toxicology section).

A study on muscle cell toxicity did not reveal muscle toxicity potential of lesinurad in Rat L6 cells in vitro at a concentration of 10 UM.

In 2 monosodium urate (MSU) dependent rodent acute gout flare models, lesinurad was efficacious in reducing inflammation from injected MSU crystals. The mechanism for this result in animals is not understood.

Safety pharmacology programme

No important safety pharmacology effects on parameters of the CNS, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and renal/urinary system were observed.

Effects of a single dose 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg lesinurad on a functional observation battery were tested in rats. No test article related effects were observed up to 300 mg/kd, corresponding to a Cmax and AUC 165x and 101x times higher than at the human MRHD, respectively.

The effect of 10, 30, 100 and 200 UM lesinurad on hERG channel current expressed in HEK293 cells was tested. The IC50 was determined to be 198 UM, while the human Cmax at MRHD was 12 ug/m. Considering the 98% protein binding of lesinurad in human plasma, the IC50 would be estimated at 9.9mM, whereas human total plasma concentration is 17UM at MRHD.

Male Cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to lesinurad (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) and cardiovascular parameters were determined using telemetry. QTcR values (QT corrected for heart rate) were similar to control values. The NOAEL for cardiovascular effects was 300 mg/kg, which co Cmax and 38x AUC of the human MRHD.

Permeability Evaluation in Caco-2 Monolayer Assay (8ARDEP3R1, SR09-066)

In-vitro permeability of lesinurad was evaluated in bidirectional experiments using Caco-2 monolayers and [14c]-lesinurad. In these studies, lesinurad showed higher basolateral to apical (B-A, approximately 12-16 10-6 cm/s) permeability than apical to basolateral (A-B, approximately 4-5 10-6 cm/s) with efflux ratios greater than 2 at 1, 10, and 100 UM, indicating that lesinurad was actively transported across Caco-2 monolayers. However, verapamil or PSC833, known P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors, had either no effect or only partially inhibited the basolateral to apical transport of lesinurad.

Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Studies

The single-dose PK studies were conducted by oral or IV dosing of lesinurad in mice (oral only), rats, dogs, and monkeys. Lesinurad was rapidly absorbed in all species following oral dosing. Bioavailability ranged from highest in dogs (100%) to lowest in monkeys (41.1%). Mean plasma lesinurad-to-total- radioactivity ratios were >than 50% in rats and monkeys, suggesting that the majority of systemic exposure to [14C] lesinurad was in the form of the parent compound lesinurad. The PK parameters determined from these studies are summarised in Table 1.

Dose Proportionality Study Following Single Dosing of Lesinurad to Sprague Dawley Rats (SR08-071)

A single-dose PK study was conducted il male Sprague Dawley rats prior to the start of the 14-day toxicology study in rats. Dose propor ionality was evaluated following a single oral dose of lesinurad at 20, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg to male rats. The rate of absorption, as measured by Tmax, increased from 2.33 to 16.5 hours as the dose increased from 20 to 1000 mg/kg. Between 20 and 300 mg/kg, exposure (as measured by AUCO-24) increased in a more than dose-proportional manner. At the 1000 mg/kg dose, absorption was delayed and exposure increased in less than a dose-proportional manner within 24 hours pos -dose.

Quantitative Tissue Distribution of Lesinurad-Derived Radioactivity in Rats (SR08-046) The distribution and concentrations of total radioactivity in male albino rats and n elbig mented rats were similar following oral administration, and the general patterns of distribution of radioactivity in albino rats were similar following oral and IV administration. Following oral administration, high concentrations of radioactivity were observed in the contents of the GI tract Urinary concentrations were also high, with a maximum level recorded at 2 hours post-dose. There was no preferential uptake of lesinurad-derived radioactivity into the brain.

Elimination of radioactivity from tissues following oral administration was generally rapid in albino and pigmented rats. Decreased tissue radioactivity levels were observed in all of the measured tissues at 24 hours post-dose, and elimination was completed by 62 hours in the pigmented rat. Tissues associated with metabolism and elimination (e.g., liver and kidney) were the only tissues to have maximum concentrations of radioactivity greater than in cardiac blood, suggesting limited uptake of radioactivity into tissues.

Metabolism

In Vitro Metabolic Profiles in Liver Microsomes and Cryopreserved Hepatocytes (SR08-038, SR08-056, SR11-031

Lesinurad was the onedominant component following incubation of [14C] lesinurad with liver

microsomes and cr yopreserved hepatocytes. The majority of the radioactivity (> 92%) was attributed to unchanged parent compound. Two oxidative metabolites, M3 and M4, were detected after incubation with both monkey and human hepatocytes. Following incubation in cryopreserved rat and dog hepatoovies, no metabolite was detected. In human and monkey hepatocytes, the M3 and M4 memodlites were present at low levels, with 92.1% and 98.1% of parent drug remaining, respectively, following 4-hour incubation.

Phenotyping of CYP enzymes responsible for lesinara oxidative metabolism revealed that in humans, CYP2C9 played a major role in the formation of oxidative metabolites (M+16) and to a lesser extent by other enzymes including CYP1A1, CYP2C19 and CYP3A. S-dealkylation of lesinurad to form metabolite M6 appeared to be catalyzed by CYP3A Metabolite M4 was detected following incubation with human liver microsomes but not with CYP2Ce Tocombinant enzyme. Conversely, metabolite M3c (an epoxide) was detected following incubation in \YP2C9 recombinant enzyme but not in human liver microsomes. In separate experiments, mEH Was identified as the enzyme responsible for conversion of the epoxide to M4 metabolite. Similar results were seen in animals, where CYP3A was responsible for S- dealkylation and CYP2C was responsible for oxidation.

Glucuronidation of lesmurad in human liver appeared to be catalyzed by UGT1A1, UGT2B7, and to a lesser extent by MA3. The glutathione conjugate of lesinurad was detected in monkey and human liver microse cubations in the presence of glutathione.

2.3.4. Toxicology

Single dose toxicity

No single dose toxicity study was submitted with lesinurad. Assessment of acute toxicity was evaluated in repeat dose toxicity studies.

Repeat dose toxicity

Lesinurad was tested in repeated dose toxicity studies in rats up to 6 months and monkeys up to 12 months. Kidney was the main target organ in rats, where severe kidney toxicity was the cause of early deaths in the high dose group in the 14 day study. In every dose group animals suffered from tubular degeneration in the kidney. It appears that kidney toxicity is transient in nature, as no tubular degeneration was seen after longer duration of treatment at similar doses. After 4 weeks of tr kidney effects were limited to increased kidney weight (still evident after 2 weeks recovery) and after 6 months to tubular dilation. Other target organs in the rat were the liver and the thyroid with hepatocellular hypertrophy occurring at 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, and hype trophy of the follicular epithelium in the thyroid. The liver effect was not completely recoverexi Könseda females after a month recovery period. The mammary gland adenocarcinomas seen in the high dose group after 6 months of dosing were likely a chance finding, as no increase in tumour ir cience was seen in the carcinogenicity study. No effects were observed in the lowest dose tested, which provides a safety margin for males of 1.3 after 4 week and 4 after 6 months, and for endes 5 after 4 weeks and 3 after 6 months.

Limited toxicity was seen in monkeys, with some effects on the gastro-intestinal tract in the form of inflammation. Bilirubin was consistently reduced, and ante

months of dosing bile duct hyperplasia occurred as well as increased kidney weight. The bile duct hyperplasia might be the result of accumulation of metabolite M6 which is excreted via bil , which does not occur in humans.

Another hypothesis to explain the development of bile duct hyperplasia is the presence of an epoxide intermediate M3c, which is converted into M9 present in monkey bile. In humans, the same epoxide intermediate is formed and subsequently converted into M4, present mainly in urine

Genotoxicity

The genotoxic potential of lesin Was assessed in vitro in a bacterial mutation assay and a mammalian cell cytogenetic des. both in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system (S9), and in vivo in a rat bone Marrow micronucleus study. Lesinurad has no genotoxic potential.

Carcinogenicity The carcinogenic potential of lesinurad was assessed in a 6-month transgenic (TgrasH2) mouse study and in a 2-year Spague Dawley rat study (Table 6).

The average lesinurad exposure (gender combined AUC0-24hr) established from Day 1 to Week 72 at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day in this study was 1469 ug.hr/mL, which is slightly higher than the average exposure (AUCO-24hr of 1193 ug.hr/mL) obtained from the 6-month rat study at a dose of 300 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for 6 months of dosing.

Exploratory plasma metabolic profiling in rats following dosing for up to 52 weeks at 200 mg/l @ day showed metabolite M2, and to a lesser extent metabolite M3, at greater than 1% of the pa compound on Day 1. At Weeks 26 and 52, metabolites M6, M8, M13, and M20 were detected in addition to M2 and M3. However, metabolite M4, which is formed via hydrolysis of ar eppxide intermediate (M3c) and a major human metabolite in human urine, was not detected in rat plasma.

There was no test article-related increase in mortality as compared to contro animals in either males or females. Microscopic evaluation indicated that there were no lesinurad-related neoplasms in males and females at any dose. Treatment-related non-neoplastic findings were present in the kidney, liver, and GI tract. In the kidney, papillary necrosis (minimal to marked severity) at 200 mg/kg/day was considered to be an adverse effect of lesinurad. In the liver, the

was an increase in the incidence of BDH, a common background observation in aged rats across al the doses. The incidence of BDH was higher in males than females, although females had higherlesmurad exposures at the highest dose. Therefore, the relationship of lesinurad or its metabolites \0 BDH in rats is uncertain.

Metal lienof lesinurad in humans was mediated mainly by CYP2C9 with minimal contributions from

CYP2C19, and CYP3A. CYP2C9 was responsible for the formation of the oxidative M3 metabolite from lesinurad. Additionally, CYP2C9 metabolized lesinurad to form an epoxide intermediate M3c, which was rapidly hydrolyzed to the dihydrodiol M4 metabolite by mEH. Therefore, M3c was only detected when in vitro incubation was conducted using CYP2C9 recombinant enzyme, which lacks the expression of mEH, or in microsomes with the presence of mEH inhibitors. In microsomes or hepatocytes where mEH was present, and in the absence of mEH inhibitors, only M4 was detected.

The applicant stated that there was no detectable epoxide intermediate in human plasma, urine, or faeces samples. In humans, M3 and M4 were detected in urine at a proportion > 10% of dose. In rats, M3 is the primary metabolite in urine (approximately 50% in male rats and 18% in female rats; thus M3 is qualified in the repeated-dose and carcinogenicity studies. In rats and monkeys, M4 is present at

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 24/128

much lower levels in urine (< 0.5% of dose), thus M4 is considered to be a disproportionate metabolite in humans. M3 and M4 have no structural alerts beyond those observed with lesinurad for genotoxicity (lesinurad was negative for genotoxicity) and are not pharmacologically active.

In contrast to humans, monkeys have only small amounts of M4 detected in urine and bile. This

is because in monkeys the epoxide hydrolase pathway was a minor route of detoxification of M3c, which reacts mainly with cysteine to form a cysteine adduct metabolite M9, presumably via a nucleophilic attack (Figure 4). The presence of a significant amount of M9 in monkey bile along with the detection of M4 in rat and mouse supports the hypothesis that metabolism involving epoxide formation occurs in all toxicology species investigated.

Although not measurable or quantifiable, the amount of the M3c en side intermediate can be calculated based on the M4 and M9 levels detected in each species. Since M4 or M9 were not measured in the pivotal toxicity studies, data generated from single or repeated-dose oral radio-labelled lesinurad studies in mice, rats, or monkeys were used to calculate the amount of epoxide intermediate. Interspecies comparison of calculated epoxide amount is presented in Table 8.

Calculated total epoxide amount estimated from M4 levels in human urine and faeces (Study 112 CSR) was 129.3 mg, or 1.5 mg/kg (per body weight), or 0.06 mg/g (per liver weight) following a single oral 600 mg [14C ]lesinurad dosing in liquid formulation, which resulted in disproportionally higher systemic exposure (AUC=123 ug·hr/mL) of lesinurad compared to AUC=28.0 ug.hr/mL at 200 mg in Study 105 CSR, where the lesinurad IR capsules were used. The epoxide in humans at the dose of 200 mg was adjusted using a correction factor of 4.39 (123/28) and calculated to be 29.5 mg for the IR capsule form.

The mean calculated amount of M3c per body weight at the NOEL (200 mg/kg/day) in rats for carcinogenicity was 0.79 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. A value for M3c could not be calculated for mice, as only trace M4 was detected in TgrasH2 mice. The calculated amount of M3c at the NOAEL (300 mg/kg/day) in monkeys (12 -month study) was 74 times the estimate amount in humans at the MRHD. Thus, M3c has been evaluated for potential general toxicit rats and monkeys along with carcinogenicity in rats. The negative results for carcinogen cityin the rat including the liver, where M3c conversion to M4 occurs, support the conclusion that there are no safety concerns associated with the levels of M3c that occur following a lifetime exposu to esinurad at the MTD.

human proportion for carcinogenicity was ulated am Of parent

In human plasma, M4 was not detected at a proportion > 10% of parent,

t was detected in human urine at a proportion > 10% of dose. The mean calculated amount of MA per body weight at the NOEL (200 mg/kg/day) in rats for carcinogenicity was 0.78 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. A value for M4 could not be calculated for mice, as only trade Ml4 was detected in TgrasH2 mice. The calculated amount of M4 per body weight at the NOALL (300 mg/kg/day) in monkeys (12- month study) was 3.1 times the estimated amount in humans at the MRHD. Therefore, M4 has been adequately assessed for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicky. Since the rat carcinogenicity was negative, there is no need to evaluate M4 in a genotoxicity battery. Furthermore, at a high dose of 1000 mg/kg in the rat micronucleus test, no increase in micronucleus was observed. Evaluation for reproductive toxicity would not be required gyen that M4 was only a disproportionate metabolite in urine. Further, the reproductive toxicity studies in rats tested at a top dose of 300 mg/kg/day of lesinurad, which conceivably would have resulted in higher M4 exposures than the high dose of 200 mg/kg/day used in the carcinogenicity study, thus contribute to the overall reproductive toxicity testing of M4.

Studies on impurities

Key intermediates and potential impurities in the synthetic pathway for lesinurad that require qualification according to ICH guidelines were adequately qualified using repeated-dose studies. As part of the genotoxic impurity control strategy, in silico evaluation and Ames testing of the impurities were carried out intermediates or starting material impurities and reagent formylhydrazine which were identined as genotoxic impurities were under the threshold of toxicological concern of (TTC) 1.5 ug/da concentration of 7.5 ppm in the 200 mg tablet (once daily) of lesinurad.

Phototoxicity

Lesinurad is able to absorb UVB light. However, due to insufficient distribution to skin and eyes, lesinurad is unlikely to have phototoxic potential.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

Pivotal non-clinical studies were claimed to be performed in accordance with GLP. However repeated dose toxicology studies were performed in laboratories that were not part of a GLN monitoring program of a Country that is an adherent to the OECD MAD (Mutual accep tance of Data; in this case China). Therefore the CHMP requested a GLP inspection to verify the Gcompliance of those sites. Inspections were conducted in July and September 2015 (INS/GLP/2015001) and did not reveal any critical findings. The CHMP therefore concluded that the data fr e non-clinical studies inspected could be used for the evaluation of the concerned application

Lesinurad is a urate-lowering therapy being developed for the chroni treatment of gout. It is a SURI that inhibits uric acid transporters in the renal proximal tubules. URA11 inhibitors such as lesinurad lower SUA by reducing reabsorption of uric acid. Although no animal models are available to test its uric acid lowering efficacy in vivo, lesinurad demonstrated inhibition of URAT1 in in vitro transporter assays at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition to URAT1, lesinurad inhibits OAT4, another transporter located in the apical membrane of the real proximal tubules.

Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not submitted and this was considered acceptable by the CHMP as there are no appropriate animal pharmacodynamic models to evaluate the intended effect in humans, due to the fact that animals uno humans possess the uricase enzyme which converts uric acid to allantoin.

No local tolerance studies were suom tted as lesinurad is administered orally and thus local tolerance in the GI tract was evaluated in the repeated-dose toxicity studies.

exhibit any clinically significant antiviral activity against HIV, but in 2 MSU dependent rodent acute gout flare models, lesinurad was efficacious in reducing inflammation from injected MSU crystals.

ortant safety pharmacology effects on parameters of the CNS, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract and renal/urinary system were observed.

The PK properties of lesinurad were studied in vitro using animal and human tissues and expressed proteins, and in vivo in the species and strains used in the safety evaluation. Exposures to lesinurad were generally at least dose-proportional in rats and monkeys, and generated large multiples of the human exposure at the MRHD. Following repeated dosing of lesinurad, toxicokinetics revealed evidence of slight auto-induction in rats at ≥ 100 mg/kg and moderate auto-induction in monkeys at ≥ 30 mg/kg.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 28/128

Lesinurad was highly protein bound. The free fraction of lesinurad in plasma is low with a fu of 2.3 % in rat, 5% in mouse and 1.7% in human, dog and monkey. Distribution to other tissues except for liver and kidney is limited. In all species, including humans, the major circulating component was unchanged lesinurad, except for monkeys where towards the end of the chronic study the dealkylated M6 metabolite was predominant.

Metabolism is a mixture of oxidation, debromination and glucuronidation, but in monkeys S- dealkylation (M6) and cysteine conjugation (M9) are important as well. All metabolites in humans were identified in the nonclinical toxicology species, with only M4 considered to be a human disproportionate urinary metabolite. M4 is formed via an epoxide intermediate (M3c) that was not detected in animals or humans. The Applicant suggested that in vivo M3c is rapidly hydrolyzed by microsomal epoxid hydrolase (mEH) into M4 (major metabolite in human urine) or M9 (major metabolite in monkey bile) and the documentation provided to support this hypothesis was considered sufficient by

MP.

The CYP P450 system and mEH are both known to be located in the smooth endoplasmatie reticulum. Further, Nishimura et al (2003) showed that CYP2A9 mRNA is highly expressed No numan liver, whereas Enayetallah et al (2004) showed by blot analyses that CYP2C9 is expressed in human bile duct and kidney and Lakehal (1999) using immunohistochemistry showed that mEH is expressed in human bile duct and kidney. The colocalization of mEH and CYP2C9 in liver and kidney enables the M3c formed by CYP2C9 to be readily hydrolyzed, which will limit exposure

On the other hand, literature data indicate that certain well-char d genetic polymorphisms in human mEH exist (Fretland et al., 2000; Pinarbasi et al., 2016) mEH polymorphism implies that there may be patient populations with an increased risk of arse effect in liver and kidney as a result of a higher M3c exposure.

The CHMP therefore considered that use of lesinurad in patients with epoxide hydrolase polymorphism should be included in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) as missing information with close surveillance of post-marketing reports for any evidence of hepatotoxicity. In addition, the CHMP recommended that the Applicant should provide the results of a study on metabolite profiling, including metabolite M4 formed by epoxide hydrolase, over 24 hours and this study is also included in the RMP.

Kidney was the main target organ in ats, where severe kidney toxicity was the cause of early deaths in the high dose group in the 14 day study. It appears that toxicity is only evident after short term treatment of up to 3 weeks, "fter which the effects are resolved. This was evidenced by kidney toxicity (tubular degeneration) at all doses in the 14-day study, at the high dose only after 14 days in the 28- day study, with margina hon- significant increases in sCr levels, and tubular injury resulting in death after 3 weeks dosing in the 6-month study. Despite these findings the CHMP considered that lesinurad

is not a classic ephrotoxicant, and possibly the observed effects were species specific, as similar lesions were

Pro observed in monkeys, and there was no classic dose response.

A mechanism of action for the kidney toxicity observed in humans has been proposed, related to the pathological condition of the patient, and more specifically the increased uric acid levels. It appears likely that due to this increased plasma and urine uric acid levels, crystallization occurs, leading to kidney damage. This is further substantiated by the fact that patients receiving concomitant allopurinol to reduce uric acid levels, showed decreased renal toxicity. A similar mechanism of action is not mimicked in animals since uric acid levels are much lower in animals.

Other target organs in the rat were the liver and the thyroid with hepatocellular hypertrophy occurring at 100 mg/kg/day in the 6-month study, and hypertrophy of the follicular epithelium in the thyroid. Limited toxicity was seen in monkeys, with some effects on the gastro-intestinal tract in the form of inflammation. Bilirubin was consistently reduced, and after 12 months of dosing bile duct hyperplasia occurred as well as increased kidney weight. The bile duct hyperplasia might be the result

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 29/128

of accumulation of metabolite M6 which is excreted via bile, which does not occur in humans. Due to the bile duct hyperplasia, the NOAEL in the 12-month study is 100 mg/kg/day, which is around 3-fold the human exposure. In clinical trials, hepatobiliary disorders including acute cholecystitis was observed at a somewhat greater incidence in the lesinurad arm as compared to placebo. However, in the long-term extension study, no trend of cholestasis in humans was observed after 24 months of follow-up. No relevant cytotoxicity was shown in HeLa-JC53 and human HepG2 cells and in contrast to benzbromarone, no mitochondrial toxicity in HepG2 cells was observed. Yet, it should also be considered that HeLa and HepG2 cells have only limited metabolic activity and therefore insufficiently cover any potential role of metabolites. Only mitochondrial toxicity was considered by the Applicant as a potential cause for DILI.

Dose-related GI toxicity was observed in all tested species and resulted in mortality at high do in rats and monkeys. In addition, decreased intestinal motility (17%) after an acute dose was seen in rats in the GI safety pharmacology study. However, in the secondary pharmacology screen, lesinurad did not have an effect on the cholinergic pharmacology at 100 uM. Thus, the mechanism underlying the GI toxicity in animals is not known. The applicant proposed that it could be car direct toxic effect or an off-target toxicity at the supra-physiological concentrations in the tract, since most of the GI toxicity occurred at a dose exceeding the MTD. The safety margins sed on systemic

exposures, at the NOAEL in rats and monkeys are 4 and 12 times the human exposure at MHD. Clinical data do not point to evidence of significant GI tract safety issues. and Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is included as an adverse effect in section 4.8 of PC. Based on the available nurad use does not appear to be data, the CHMP concluded that GI tract toxicity in association a significant clinical concern .

Lesinurad was shown not to have a genotoxic potential.

Lesinurad was not carcinogenic in the 2-year rat so with exposures over 50-fold the human exposure or in the 6 month study in the TgrasH2 mouse model, with exposures of over 30 (females) and 60 (males) the human exposure.

The results of the 13-week rat combin ation study are sufficient to support the treatment of gout patients with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol.

The combination toxicology studes with lesinurad and allopurinol or febuxostat showed no additive, synergistic, overlapping, or new toxicity when the agents were coadministered, supporting combination dosing of lesinurad with erher NO inhibitor.

There was no effect ale or female fertility due to treatment with lesinurad. There were no effects on the offspring of cats treated with up to 300 mg/kg/day lesinurad, resulting in 46-fold the human exposure. In rabbits, treatment with lesinurad caused severe maternal toxicity resulting in a reduction in viable fo tues due to increased resorptions. Even though maternal toxicity is still evident at the low dose Grifects on foetuses were observed at this dose, providing a safety margin of 4. No increase in malformations of variations was seen in any of the groups. As noted by the applicant, the number of litter available for analysis was reduced in the mid dose group, and no litters were available in the high dose group due to maternal toxicity. The applicant referred to a scientific advice provided by the CHMP, which stated that no further studies were necessary.

In the pre- and postnatal study in rats, lesinurad was maternally toxic at all doses, resulting in reduced body weight gain at the low dose from GD17 and severe toxicity and death in the mid and high dose groups. Reduced viable foetuses, reduced pup body weight and mortalities were observed in groups treated with 200 mg/kg/day or higher. No such effects were seen at the low dose of 100 mg/kg/day, resulting in and exposure 14-fold the human exposure. Surviving pups did not show any effects on behaviour or reproduction performance at any dose group, up to 40-fold the human exposure.

C

The pharmacokinetic properties of lesinurad were evaluated with a number of different formulations including, solutions, immediate release (IR) capsules and tablets. Lesinurad was present as sodium salt or free acid in the

rent formulations.

Absorption of lesinured in healthy subjects after a single dose of lesinurad (5 to 600 mg) using different formulations under fasted conditions was rapid and the Cmax occurred after ≤3 hours. Tmax was ~2.0 hours for the immediate release tablet of the free acid.

Medicinal

Bioa lity

absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of lesinurad was determined in 10 healthy adult male subjects in study 131. The subjects received a non-radiolabeled oral dose of 400 mg lesinurad tablet under fasted conditions and a 15-minute IV infusion of 100 ug [14C]lesinurad microtracer dose commencing at 1.75 hours post oral dose to coincide with the expected mean oral Tmax . By comparing dose-normalized AUCo-o of lesinurad from oral and IV dosing, the absolute oral bioavailability for lesinurad was determined to be 101% (90% CI: 95.4% to 106%).

Comparison of trial formulations with finished product In studies 129 and 132, the effect of 2 different manufacturing sites on the bioavailability of commercial lesinurad 400 mg FA tablets was investigated in healthy, adult male subjects under fasted

and fed conditions. One batch (ELAD) was manufactured at the proposed commercial site (AstraZeneca AB) and compared to batch (12A015) manufactured at the Phase III manufacturing site (Metrics, Inc.). In study 129, 72 subjects were divided over 4 cohorts (2 sequences with 9 subjects per sequence). In study 132, 54 subjects were divided over 2 groups (n=27 per group) who received either lesinurad manufactured at the commercial site or manufactured at the Phase III production site under fasting conditions with a 3 day wash out period. Subjects were separated into 2 dosing subgroups due to limited capacity at the clinical research unit. In both studies, the batch produced at the proposed commercial site was bioequivalent to the batch manufactured at the Phase III site (Table 10).

Distribution Plasma protein binding

The in vitro binding of lesinurad to human plasma proteins was evaluated using radiolabeled lesinurad at concentrations of 1, 10, and 50 UM in all species using equilibrium dialysis (study SR08-045). Mean plasma protein binding of lesinurad was equal to or greater than 97% over the investigated concentration range (98.5 + 0.06% at 1 M; 98.4 + 0.02% at 10 UM and 97.9 + 0.17% at 50 UM). The binding was primarily due to interaction with albumin with minimal contribution from a-1-acid glycoprotein.

Plasma protein binding of lesinurad was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (99 bound) and moderate hepatic impairment (98.8% bound) compared with subjects with norma function (99.0% bound) (study 118).

Plasma protein binding of lesinurad ranged from 98.7% to 99.0% across the different categories (study 120). Plasma protein binding decreased slightly in subjects with moderate (98.7% + 0.207%) and severe renal impairment (98.7% + 0.174%) compared with subjects with normal renal function (99.0% + 0.142%).

Blood-to-plasma ratio

The blood-to-plasma ratio was determined in vivo (study 112). Followmy a single oral dose of 600 mg [14C]-lesinurad to healthy male volunteers, the mean whole blood o plasma ratios of AUC and Cmax ranged between 0.54 and 0.55.

Volume of distribution

Following a single IV dose of 100 ug [14C]-lesinurad, the volume of distribution at steady state was 20.3 L (study 131).

Elimination

The elimination half-life ranged from 2.7 to 1795 hours. The half-life for the immediate release capsule of the free acid ranged from 3.1 to 5.

Excretion

The mass balance was evaluated in o healthy male volunteers receiving a single 600 mg dose of [14C]-lesinurad (sodium salt) oral solution (Absorption, metabolism and excretion Study 112). Renal clearance is 25.6 mL/min (CV=56%). In total, 63% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 32% in feces after a per or of 0 to 144 hours (Figure 5). The majority of the administered dose was excreted within the First 24 hours (~60% via urine).

CYPe abolite by microsomal man eporation of Sonthorse was found to be mediated mainly by CYP2C9 with minimal contributions from C131A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A. CYP2C9 is considered to play a major role in the formation of oxide metabolites (M3, M3b, M4, M5, M5b). CYP2C9 metabolizes lesinurad to form an epoxide intermediate M3c, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to the M4 metabolite by microsomal epoxide hydrolase through the combination of CYP2C9 and gastrointestinal microflora. The formation of M6 is catalysed by CYP3A4, but the elimination of lesinurad through this path wa ( Is negligible in humans in vivo. Based on the data from study 112 (AME study), the applicant proposed the following metabolic pathway of lesinurad:

Lesinurad is a racemic mixture (50:50) of 2 atropisomers. Quality tests have shown that the atropisomers do not readily interconvert even under extreme conditions. Lesinurad atropisomers were investigated individually to assess potential metabolism differences in human and monkey liver microsomes and recombinant CYPs. The formation of lesinurad metabolite M3c was primarily from atropisomer 1, the M3 and M4 metabolites were formed from both atropisomers with higher levels by atropisomer 1. M6 was also formed from both atropisomers with greater preference from atropisomer 2.

The ratios of atropisomer 1 and atropisomer 2 were determined in study 126 Cohort 2 and were 43:57 at Cmax,ss and 20:80 at Cmin,ss. The half-live is 3.8 h for atropisomer 1 and 6.2 h for atropisomer 2. The urinary atropisomer 1/atropisomer 2 ratio was 0.648 for the amount excreted unchanged from 0 to 24 hours (Ae0-24) and 0.836 for renal clearance from 0 to 24 hours (CLRO-24). No atropisomer rati Fre warranted for faeces since the majority of the radioactivity is excreted via urine and not

Atropisomer 1 is in vitro extensively metabolised by CYP2C9 to M3 and M3c. M3c is further metabolised to M4 by microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Atropisomer 2 is metabolised to M6 by SPA4, but to a more limited extent. The in vitro metabolism studies are consistent with the observed vivo plasma concentrations of atropisomer 1 and 2 and the shorter t1/2 observed for atropkomer 1 compared to atropisomer 2.

Transport

From do studies lesinurad was found to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OCT1, OAT1 and OAT3. limited increased uptake could be detected in vitro in BCRP and OATP1B3 expressing cells (<30% increase). Lesinurad was not a substrate of P-glycoprotein, MRP2, MRP4 and OCT2.

Consequences of possible genetic polymorphism

The applicant submitted a cross-study analysis of the effect of CYP2C9 polymorphism on lesinurad pharmacokinetics in humans. This was based on data from studies 109 (relative BA study), 110 (DDI study of allopurinol and colchicine), 111 (DDI study of febuxostat and colchicine), 202 and 203 (dose finding). CYP2C9 genotype information was collected in 8 healthy subjects and 110 gout patients.

The effect of CYP2C9 polymorphism on lesinurad PK was evaluated by calculating differences in PK parameters between *1/*1 subjects and other CYP2C9 polymorphisms (Table 12).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies

The dose proportionality of lesinurad under the fasted (5 to 600 mg) and fed (100 to 1600 mg) conditions under fasted conditions was assessed separately in pooled PK parameters from healthy volunteers receiving lesinurad alone.

Proportionality analysis was performed using the power model (Peng 2004). Data were pooled from studies involving lesinurad solutions, sodium salt and free acid capsules and tablets for the dos -proportionality assessment. Results from the pooled PK parameters confirmed that both Cmax and AUC values for lesinurad increased proportionally between 5 mg to 600 mg under fasted condition (Figure 7).

Two studies were conducted in otherwise healthy subjects with renal-impaired (studies 104 and 120). In addition, one study was performed in renal-impaired gout patients (studies 203 main).

In study 104, the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad were evaluated following a single oral dose of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg capsule) in adult volunteers with normal, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment. In study 120, the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad were evaluated following a single oral dose of 400 mg (one FA tablet) in adult volunteers with normal, mild, moderate or severe renal impairment.

In both studies, lesinurad exposure was found to increase with the level of renal impairment (Table 16).

PD interaction-studies with XO-inhibitors were also submitted: Furthermore, a QT study was performed in healthy volunteers using super-therapeutic doses (Study 117).

Mechanism of action

Lesinurad was tested in multiple human transporter assays involved in uric acid regulation including URAT1, OATs, and other transporters and enzymes. Lesinurad showed inhibitory activity on both URAT1 and OAT4 (IC50 = 7.3 UM and 3.7 UM, respectively).

URAT1 is considered to be responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen. By inhibiting URAT1, lesinurad increases uric acid excretion and thereby lowers SUA. Lesinurad also inhibits OAT4, a uric acid transporter which is thought to be involved in diuretic-

In Study 102, multiple doses of lesinurad 100/200/400 mg or matched placebo were given for 7-10 days to 32 normal healthy volunteers, with a baseline su · 5 mg/dl. Steady-state of the PD effect was achieved at Day 6. The mean reduction from baseline serum Uric Acid (SUA) was ~30-40% for the 200-400 mg dose (Table 23) decreases in SUA concentrations were similar in male and female subjects.

The observed effects were considerable higher under fed conditions. With the 100 mg dose, the SUA effect after a single dose in the morning was attenuated within 12 hrs, whereas a more sustained effect was shown for the 200-400 mg doses. After cessation of the study drugs on Day 10, mean SUA for all lesinurad-treated groups gradually returned to baseline in about 48 hrs. There was no rebound effect.

Exploratory PD study in gout patients

The proof of concept of lesinurad was explored in gout patients in Study 201, a 2-weeks study in gout patients, with a randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled design. In Cohort 1, 21 subjects were randomized in a 2: 1: 1 ratio to lesinurad 400 mg qd, matching placebo or allopurinol 300 mg qd (open-label). In a second cohort, 7 patients were randomised to combination therapy of lesinurad + allopurinol and allopurinol + placebo (5: 1 ratio). All patients received colchicine to protect them against ULT-induced flares. Only gout patients were eligible with obvious hyperuricaemia (SUA > 8 mg/dL), who did not received any ULT in the 3 months before the study.

The effects of lesinurad on uric acid serum levels are presented in Table 24.

2.4.4. Discussion on clinical pharmacology

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of lesinurad are relatively simple as absorption occurs in a dose proportional manner and there is no accumulation after repeated dosing. The absolute bioavailability of lesinurad is approximately 100%. Lesinurad is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Following administration of a single oral dose of lesinurad in either the fed or fasted state, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were attained within 1 to 4 hours omax and AUC exposures of lesinurad increased

proportionally with single doses of lesintrad from 5 to 1,200 mg. In the fed state, after a single dose of lesinurad 200 mg, geometric meak lesinurad Cmax and AUC were 6 ug/mL and 29 ug/hr/mL, respectively. There was no apparent influence of the fat content in the meal on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad. In clinical trials, Isinurad was administered with food, because the serum uric acid lowering was improvedy

Age, and race did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad, but weight had an effect on the volume of distribution of lesinurad, but not on the exposure. The pharmacokinetics of lesingrad are similar in gout patients compared to healthy subjects at the clinical dose of 200 mg. Lesinurad is extensively bound to proteins in plasma (greater than 98%), mainly to albumin. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The mean steady state volume of distribution of lesinurad was approximately 20 L following intravenous dosing. Mean plasma-to-blood ratios of lesinurad AUC and Cmax were approximately 1.8, indicating that radioactivity was largely contained in the plasma space and did not penetrate or partition extensively into red blood cells. Excretion is for ~60% via urine as lesinurad (half of the radioactivity in urine) and metabolites. Around 40% is excreted via faeces and almost completely as metabolite. The metabolite

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 53/128

profile of lesinurad in plasma was determined 3 hours after dose administration which is ~ 1 hour after Cmax.

Lesinurad is highly protein bound and renal clearance is high (as compared to typical human glomerular filtration rate), indicating that active secretion plays an important role in the renal excretion of lesinurad. Within 7 days following single dosing of radiolabeled lesinurad, 63% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 32% of administered radioactive dose was recovered in faeces. Most of the radioactivity recovered in urine (>60% of dose) occurred in the first 24 hours. Unchanged lesinurad in urine accounted for approximately 30% of the dose. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of lesinurad was approximately 5 hours following a single dose. Lesinurad does not accumulate following multiple doses.

Lesinurad undergoes oxidative metabolism mainly via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 to inter metabolite M3c (not detected in vivo) and is subsequently metabolised by mEH to metaborte M4; there is minimal contribution from CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP3A to the metabolism Metabolites are not known to contribute to the uric acid lowering effects of lesindad. Lesinurad is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and mEH, and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYPRC>9 and CYP3A. In vitro, lesinurad is an inhibitor of CYP2C8, but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C WYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and mEH. In addition, lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A via CAR/PXR. In vivo, lesinurad is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP2C9 and 202. but a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. CYP2B6 has not been studied in vivo.

Only one strength (200 mg) was developed which limits the possibility of dose adjustments in special populations. Lesinurad exposure is significantly increased in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment, but not in subjects with mild rend impairment. As will be discussed later in the Clinical Efficacy and Safety sections, efficacy and rena safety in subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline was not different from subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, no dosing adjustment is required in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, a contra- indication has been made for patients with severe renal impairment, as lesinurad may be less effective in this group, as it has to be parated in the urine to establish a PD effect on the URAT-1 receptors.

No studies were performed in subject with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, no dose recommendation could be made for this special population. However, use of lesinurad in patients with severe hepatic impairment is included in the RMP as missing information in order to collect further data in this sub-population of patients through signal detection and review of this topic in aggregate safety reports.

The effect of CYP2C9 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of lesinurad was studied in 8 healthy subjects and 59 patients with gout following daily dosing of lesinurad ranging from 200 mg to 600 mg in the absence or presence of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. At the 400 mg dose, when compared with extensive CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*1) increased lesinurad exposures were observed in intermediate CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *1/*3,) and in poor CYP2C9 metabolisers (CYP2C9 *3/*3), accompanied with higher lesinurad renal excretion. However, individual values were well within the range observed in the extensive metaboliser subjects. Therefore the CHMP recommended that patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolisers based on previous history or experience with other CYP2C9 substrates should use lesinurad with caution.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis of clinical data in gout patients treated for up to 12 months estimated increases in lesinurad exposure of approximately 12%, 31% and 65% in patients with mild,

moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal function.

Following administration of a single dose of Zurampic to individuals with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function lesinurad Cmax and AUC, respectively, were 36% and 30% higher (200 mg) in patients with mild renal impairment (eCrCL 60 to 89 mL/min), 20% and 73% higher (200 mg) and 3% and 50% higher (400 mg) in patients with moderate renal impairment (eCrCL 30 to 59 mL/min), and 13% higher and 113% higher (400 mg) in patients with severe renal impairment (eCrCL <30 mL/min).

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions demonstrated that lesinurad is an in vitro inducer of CYP3A4. clinical data also indicate that it is a mild to moderate inducer of CYP3A. Lesinurad is also an i inducer of CYP2B6, but no relevant in vivo DDI studies were performed. Therefore, it is recommended in the SmPC that patients are monitored for reduced efficacy of CYP2B6 substrates (such as bupropion, efavirenz) when co-administered with lesinurad.

In addition, no in vitro studies were performed to exclude that lesinurad acts asvar inhibitor of the transporter BSEP (inhibition can be involved in clinically relevant in vivo drug interactions excreted via BSEP). The CHMP therefore requested that the Applicant further investigate the potential of lesinurad to inhibit BSEP and this missing information and details of the corresponding study is included in the RMP.

Pharmacodynamics

O

The data indicate that the combination with allopurinol or febuxostat at therapeutic doses, significantly reduced systemic and urinary uric acid load. mis dual mechanism may thus improve clinical response and safety of lesinurad. No data are available Of lower doses of allopurinol background treatment than 300 mg. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that patients are treated with a minimum allopurinol dose of 300 mg as stipulated in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.

Although the plasma levels of lexinurad increase significantly at renal impairment, because lesinurad is cleared by the renal pathway the overall capacity to excrete UA and the effect of lesinurad was reduced in patients with moderate-severe renal impairment. The impact of mild-moderate renal impairment at chronic uge has been further studied in the clinical trial program of lesinurad and described in detall IN Section 2.5 of this report.

Medicinal products

2.4.5. sions on clinical pharmacology

The phal macokinetics of lesinurad were thoroughly investigated. However, as detailed in the non-

clicca section, additional information regarding metabolite profiling but also on the potential inhibitory effectof lesinurad on the transporter BSEP will be further investigated with two studies which are included in the RMP.

The pharmacodynamic effect of lesinurad in lowering serum uric acid has been convincingly demonstrated. The combination with a XOI is considered as a useful addition to the currently available treatment options in this area. The effect of renal impairment on PK-PD was explored in single dose studies. From these studies it is difficult to tell what would be the net clinical effect at multiple doses. However, based on the main clinical trial data (presented and discussed in Section 2.5 of this report) in subjects with a mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline but also the PK-PD modelling results

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 55/128

submitted, the CHMP concluded that no dose adjustments of the standard 200 mg dose are required for mild-moderate renal impaired patients.

For patients with severe renal impairment, it is anticipated that lesinurad will be poorly excreted in the renal tubule where it should act, and the aimed PD effects of stimulated UA excretion will be low. The CHMP therefore considered that a contra-indication is required for this vulnerable group and this has been included in the SmPC.

Long-term open-label extension studies

Patients from phase II and III studies could continue treatment with lesinurad 200 or 400 mg in the open-label extension phase up to 30 months (Table 28). Subjects from the allopurinol combination studies (Studies 301, 302 and 203) who continued treatment in the OL extension phase, were pooled

in Study 306. In Study 307, subjects were included from Study 304, the febuxostat combination study. These studies are still ongoing, and interim safety data are included in the dossier. Study 305, the open-label extension study of the Phase III monotherapy Study 303, was terminated prematurely because of an increased incidence of acute renal complications like nephrolithiasis and serum creatinine elevations. However, use of lesinurad as monotherapy was not claimed by the Applicant but only in combination use with either allopurinol or febuxostat. Data form this study and the other monotherapy studies were submitted only as supportive evidence for the claimed indication.

2.5.1. Dose response study

Lesinurad 200/400/600mg doses were explored in Study {03) a randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, as add on therapy to allopurinol in gout patients.

Medicinal product no longer authorised

This Study consisted of two phases: a 4-weeks con Stady with sequential cohorts of the 200/400/600 mg lesinurad dosing groups, followed by an extended blinded placebo-controlled phase up to 44 weeks. To enter the extension phase, subjects were re-randomised to either lesinurad 200 mg or placebo -disregarding their dose in the pro study phase -. The lesinurad dose and the placebo equivalent could be individually up-titrated to maximal 600 mg, guided by treatment target SUA level

and safety. Once the maximal dos 500 mg was achieved and the treatment SUA target level was still not achieved, the background alopurinol dose could be up-titrated as rescue medication. Subjects received colchicine for gout fare prophylaxis through Week 20 of the Extension Period.

The primary objective the study was to assess the % reduction from baseline in SUA levels following catment with lesinurad in combination with allopurinol compared to allopurinol with documented inadequate hypouricaemic response to standard doses of

4 weeks of continuort alone in gout patie allopurinol.

Results

The primary efficacy endpoint was the % reduction from baseline in SUA following 4 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant decreases in SUA were achieved favoring lesinurad versus placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint, which was the percent reduction from Baseline in SUA following 4 weeks of treatment. At Day 27 in the ITT population, as assessed by absolute values, change from Baseline, and percent change from Baseline, there were statistically significant reductions in all lesinurad treatment groups compared to the placebo group (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons, Figure 13).

Treatments

Subjects were randomised 1:1:1 and assigned to the following treatments:

Group A: placebo + allopurinol (PBO + ALLO group);

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 60/128


Group B: lesinurad 200 mg + allopurinol (LESU 200 mg + ALLO group);

Group C: lesinurad 400 mg + allopurinol (LESU 400 mg + ALLO group).

All doses of lesinurad/placebo and allopurinol were taken in the morning with food and 240 ml of water. Subjects were instructed to drink 2 L of water per day. If the dose of allopurinol was interrupted, the subject was not to take their dose of lesinurad/placebo until allopurinol was resumed

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of lesinurad by Month 6 when used in combination with allopurinol compared to allopurinol monotherapy.

Secondary objectives included:

. To determine the efficacy of lesinurad by Month 12 when used in combination with all compared to allopurinol monotherapy;

Spurinol

. To determine the safety of lesinurad over 6 months and 12 months when used in combination with allopurinol;

. To determine the effect of lesinurad when used in combination with alopurinol on Health Related Quality of Life and physical function

Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

. The proportion of subjects with a SUA level that is < 0.0 mg/dl at the Month 6 visit. Subjects with missing values at Month 6 for any reason were considered non-responders.

Key secondary endpoints:

. Mean rate of gout flares requiring trea ment for the 6-month period from the end of Month 6 to the end of Month 12.

· Proportion of subjects with ≥ (CR) of at least 1 target tophus by Month 12 (i.e. last on-study visit).

Secondary endpoints related O SUA were also included:

· Proportion of subjects whose sUA level is < 6.0 mg/dl, < 5.0 mg/dl and < 4.0 mg/dl at each visit.

· Absolute percent change from Baseline in SUA levels at each visit.

Other tophue related secondary endpoints included: Man percent change from Baseline in the sum of the areas for all target tophi at each visit.

Pal et reported outcomes (PROs)

The following secondary endpoints were included:

. Proportion of subjects with an improvement from Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) of at least 0.25 at Month 12.

. Mean change from Baseline to Month 12 in the physical component scale of the Short Form-36.

. Total Treatment Satisfaction Question for Medication Score.

. Mean change from Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale.

· Mean change from Baseline in Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity.

PRO assessment was conducted at baseline, and at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12.

Sample size

Rather than on the primary endpoint, the sample size of 600 subjects (200 per study arm) was based on the key secondary endpoint of mean rate of gout flares. Based on a clinically meaningful 50% reduction in the rate of flares, and a coefficient of variation of 2.0 or less, a sample size of 200 subjects per treatment group provides greater than 80% power to detect this difference in gout flare rates using a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test at alpha = 0.025 (two-sided).

A Phase 2b study showed response rates of 70% for lesinurad in combination with allopurinol 30% for the allopurinol alone group. This sample size of 600 subjects provides greater than power to detect a difference in response rates if the lesinurad plus allopurinol treatment gomes have response rates as low as 48% versus 30% response rate and using Fisher's exact test multiplicity with alpha = 0.025 (two-sided) for each test.

Randomisation

voice response system / interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Randomisation was stratified by the following factors:

· Renal function at Day -7: eCrCl > 60 mL/min vs. < 60 ml/rom (Cockcroft-Gault formula, ideal body weight)

· Tophus status: presence of ≥ 1 tophus vs. absenc Blinding (masking) This was a double-blind study. Statistical methods Primary analysis: Medicinal product no longerauthorised Randomisation took place across all study sites using a centralized interago

All randomized subjects who received aNleast 1 dose of randomized study medication were included in the ITT Population. This population was used as the primary population for all efficacy analyses. The PP (per protocol) population was used for sensitivity analyses.

The difference in sUA response rates between the placebo and each lesinurad treatment group was tested using Cochran Matel Haenszel methodology, using the randomisation stratification factors. Results were summanised by treatment group and expressed as proportions, corresponding adjusted 95% confidence intervals (Cls) of the difference between response rates, and p-values.

The primary method for imputing missing data was non-responder imputation (NRI); subjects who were ising their Month 6 sUA result were analysed as non-responders. In addition, the Last

ation carried forward (LOCF) method was also used to impute missing data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of the primary efficacy results. First, an LOCF analysis was performed for response rates at each sUA target for each visit by treatment group. To be included in the LOCF analysis, a subject had to have at least 1 post-Baseline sUA result, as only post-Baseline SUA results can be carried forward. Secondly, an observed cases analysis was conducted for response rates at each level for each visit by treatment group. Third, the proportion of subjects with an SUA < 6.0 mg/dl at all 3 of Months 4, 5, and 6 was computed. Any subject missing any 1 of the Months 4, 5, or 6 SUA levels was considered a non-responder for this analysis.

Analysis of gout flares

Only disease flares that required the use of colchicine, analgesics, and/or anti-inflammatory medication, were included in the analyses of the key secondary outcome.

The rate of gout flares requiring treatment in each of the 2 lesinurad treatment groups were compared with the placebo group using a negative binomial model. The model included the randomisation stratification factors and the logarithm of the subject's corresponding time on-study in the interval was used as an offset variable in the model to adjust for subjects having different exposure times during which the events occurred.

Analysis of tophi

Tophus measurements for subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at Baseline were categorized pages the best response among all measured target tophi at each visit as follows:

· Complete resolution (CR; disappearance of ≥ 1 target tophus);

· Partial resolution (PR; ≥ 50% decrease in the area of ≥ 1 target tophus

. Stable disease (neither > 50% decrease nor > 25% increase in the

· Progressive disease (≥25% increase in the area of a target topus).

of a target tophus);

If any single measured target tophus showed progression at a vis best tophus response for that subject at that visit was progressive disease, regardless of the espo use of any other target tophi at that visit.

Subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at Baseline with a best response of CR of≥ 1 target tophus by Month 12 (analysed using last on-study visit), at their Month 12 Visit, and at each visit were summarized by treatment group. The primary analysis of this ent pomt was based on the best response of CR of≥ 1 target tophus by Month 12. Subjects who had progressive disease at their last on-study visit and those who did not achieve a CR at their last on-study visit were considered non-responders. The difference in tophus resolution rates on the subset of subjects with measurable tophi at Baseline between placebo and each lesinurad group was tested using the CMH test statistic, stratifying by Day -7 renal function (randomized values).

There were 3 substantial protocol amendments during the study but before breaking the blind.

The first amendnicht reduced the sUA threshold for eligibility at day -7 (final baseline value) from ≥ 6.5 mg/dl to ≥ 6.0 mg/dl, following feedback from the FDA. The gout flare secondary endpoint was also modi edintluding an increase in the period of observation, which resulted in a reduced sample size. 17 randomised subjects were screened prior to this amendment.

The second amendment expanded guidance on subject hydration and guidance for investigators in case of raised sCr or kidney stone, and added an independent Renal Events Adjudication Committee (REAC).

The last substantial amendment was triggered by the results of the lesinurad monotherapy study 303 in which SAEs of acute renal failure were reported in subjects receiving lesinurad. The amendment included a requirement to take allopurinol at the same time as lesinurad, to withdraw any subject developing a kidney stone, to increase monitoring of renal function and to tighten withdrawal criteria based on renal function.

The most common protocol violation and deviation (PDV) was randomised study medication non- compliance, affecting 7.5%, 7.5% and 4.0% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The next most common PDV was allopurinol dose < 300 mg qd (< 200 mg qd if moderate renal impairment at time of randomisation), affecting 0%, 3.0% and 2.0% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In addition, 2 subjects received the wrong randomised study kit at one study visit.

Baseline data

The study population was predominantly male and white, with a median age of 52 years. Less than 2% were over 75 years of age. Mean body mass index was 34.8 kg/m2.

The mean duration since gout diagnosis was around 12 years. At least one target tophi was present at baseline for 9% of subjects, of which the majority had only one. The mean number of gout ya es reported in the past 12 months was 4.8. Moderate renal impairment (eCrCl < 60 mL/min) was present at baseline for 20.9%. Those with more severe renal impairment are slightly over-represented in the placebo arm. Mean SUA at baseline was 6.9 mg/dL. Around 90% of subjects were on an allopurinol dose of 300 mg daily at baseline. Demographic characteristics, baseline disease and treatment characteristics are summarised in Tables 29 and 30 respectively.

Other secondary efficacy endpoint Gout flares

The rates of gout flares per Subject that required treatment over the 6-month period from end of Month 6 to end of Month 12 were 0.57, 0.51 and 0.58 for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respective y. The rates for the lesinurad groups were not significantly different from the placebo group.

The proportion ubjects requiring treatment for a gout flare between the end of Month 6 and the end of Month 11 was 28.8%, 20.4% and 27.9% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo

groups

Anduses of subject diary entries for gout flares requiring treatment demonstrated no clear patterns of differences for duration of gout flare, pain scores, associated gout flare symptoms and gout flare treatment.

Tophus resolution

The proportions of subjects with ≥ 1 target tophus at baseline who achieved a complete response by Month 12 were 0/18 (0%) and 4/19 (21.1%) versus 5/17 (29.4%) for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively.

Conduct of the study

In addition to the protocol amendments described for Study 301, on 20 December 2013, the BfArM required restriction of recruitment of subjects in Germany to those who had failed to respond to other established alternative therapies as given in national and international treatment guidelj Sponsor discontinued all subjects in Germany, and all German sites were closed. This affec randomised subjects, who are included in the participant flow diagram (above) as discontin (sponsor terminated study).

The

The most common PDV was randomised study medication non-compliance, affexting 5.9%, 5.5% and 2.4% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The next most common PDV was allopurinol dose < 300 mg qd (< 200 mg qd if moderate nal impairment at time of randomisation), affecting 2.5% to 2.9% across the treatment groups.

Baseline data

The study population was predominantly male and white, with a median age of 52 years. Less than 2% were over 75 years of age. Mean body mass index was $4 1 8g/m2. Demographic characteristics were balanced between the groups. Demographic characteristics, baseline disease are summarised in Table 32.

· Lesinurad 200 mg qd + febuxostat 80 mg qg

· Lesinurad 400 mg qd + febuxostat 80 mg ga

· Placebo + febuxostat 80 mg

All subjects were to receive randomised study medication, in addition to febuxostat, for 12 months.

All doses of lesinurad/placebo were taken in the morning with food and 240 ml water. Subjects were instructed to drink 2L of liquid per day. Febuxostat was taken at the same time as lesinurad/placebo. If febuxostat was interrupted, Mesilurad/placebo was also stopped until febuxostat was resumed.

Objectives

Primary objective

To determine efficacy of lesinurad by Month 6 when used in combination with febuxostat compared

to febuxo honotherapy.

A secondary objective was to determine efficacy and safety by Month 12.

Outcomes/endpoints

Primary endpoint:

· The proportion of subjects with a SUA level that is < 5.0 mg/dl by Month 6.

Key secondary endpoints:

· Proportion of subjects who experience complete resolution of at least 1 target tophus by Month 12;

· Proportion of subjects with a best tophus response on at least 1 target tophus of complete or partial resolution by Month 12;

. Proportion of subjects with an improvement from Baseline in HAQ-DI of at least 0.25 at Month 12.

Other SUA related secondary endpoints:

· Proportion of subjects whose sUA level is < 6.0 mg/dl, < 5.0 mg/dl and < 4.0 mg/dl at each visit;

· Absolute and percent change from Baseline in SUA levels at each visit

Sample size

Approximately 315 subjects were to be randomized In this study, of which approximately 105 subjects were to be randomized to each treatment group Based on previous studies of lesinurad and febuxostat, it was conservatively assumed that the proportion of subjects with SUA < 5.0 mg/dl after 6 months of treatment would be 40% or less in the placebo plus febuxostat group and 65% or higher in the lesinurad plus febuxostat groups. Detecting a significant treatment effect under these assumptions with approximately 90% power and a = 0.025 (two-sided) required 105 subjects per treatment group using Fishers exact est.

Medicinal pro Wering a space plus 65%

Randomisation

Subjects were randomi the 3 treatment groups in the ratio 1:1: 1. Randomisation was stratified by:

Renas function at day -7: eCrCl > 60 mL/min vs. < 60 mL/min (calculated by the Cockcroft- Gayh formula using IBW)

A at Day -7: > 6.0 mg/dl versus < 6.0 mg/dl

Nebus were randomised after the Investigator verified that they were eligible for the study. Randomisation took place across all study sites using a centralized interactive voice response system / interactive web response system.

Blinding (masking)

This was a double-blind study.

Statistical methods

These were similar to those used in Studies 301 and 302.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 78/128

Diverse sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary endpoints.

Subgroup analyses were performed in subjects that did not already achieve the target SUA < 5mg/dl after the 3 weeks open-label lead-in of febuxostat monotherapy. Additional sensitivity analyses were either different approaches of missing data (LOCF, Per-Protocol population, Observed Cases), different cut-off points of SUA (<3,4,6 mg/dl at Month 6), or endpoints reflecting a more sustained effect on SUA levels ((a) SUA < 5 mg/dl at Month 4,5,6 consecutively or on at Month 12, subjects with a median SUA level <5 mg/dl throughout the study), or the immediate effect (< 5 mg/dl at Month 1).

There were 4 substantial protocol amendments during the study but before breaking the blind.

The first clarified that a dose reduction of febuxostat to 40 mg qd following interruption due to potential toxicity was not permitted. No subjects were randomised prior to this amendment.

Page 79/128

With the second, the SUA inclusion criterion was lowered from ≥ 10 mg/dL to ≥ 8 mg/dl for subjects not taking an approved ULT at screening. The gout flare secondary endpoint was also modified, including an increase in the period of observation. 80 patients were randomised prior to this amendment.

The other two were the same as the ones applied to Studies 301 and 302 regarding expanded guidance on hydration and the tightening of renal function monitoring triggered by the results in Study 303.

The most common PDV was randomised study medication non-compliance, affecting 2.8%, 7.3% and 0.9% of the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 5.5% of subjects were excluded from the per protocol population.

The mean duration since gout diagnosis was around 15 years. The mean number of target tophi at baseline was 1.8. The mean number of gout flares reported in the past 12 months was 6.7. Moderate renal impairment (eCrCl < 60 mL/min) was present at baseline for 23.1. Baseline SUA was <5.0 mg/dl for more than 50% of all subjects: 44.3%, 53.2% and 53.2% in the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively.

Note: Subjects missing the Month 6 sUA result were treated as nonresponders.

Sensitivity analyses

Using the LOCF imputation method, the proportion of subjects who achieved the target of SUA < 5.0

mg/dl at Month 6 was 64. 1% for lesinurad 200 mg vs. 50.9% for placebo (p Q)377). For the lesinurad 400 mg group the proportion was 83.0% (p<0.0001 vs. placebo))

The proportion of subjects with an SUA < 5.0 mg/dl at 3 consecutive using nonresponder imputation was higher in the lesinurad 200 group (51.9% versus 33.0%, respectively; p = 0.0034), and

group compared with the placebo lasinurad 400 mg group compared

The results in the Per Protocol Population confirmed those of the primary analysis. In the Per Protocol Population, significantly more subjects in the lesinured 00 mg group achieved the target goal of SUA < 5.0 mg/dl at Month 6 compared with the placebo group: 80.0% vs. 58.8% (p < 0.0001). The respective proportions for the comparison of sinurad 200 mg with placebo was 58.8% vs. 48.1% (p = 0.1001).

At all time-points other than Monto 6 (primary endpoint), the increase in SUA lowering in the lesinurad 200 mg group, compared to macobo, was statistically significant, Figure 18.

In this subgroup, subjects treated with lesinurad were also more likely to have sustained sUA response achieving target SUA < 5.0 mg/dl at 3 consecutive months (between months 4 and 6, Table 39).

Key econdary outcomes

In accordance with the hierarchical testing schedule, the key secondary endpoints were not formally tested for the 200 mg dose, as the primary endpoint failed. For the 400 mg dose, the formal testing stopped right after the first key secondary tested, as this one failed to meet statistical significance

Other secondary efficacy endpoint analyses

Tophus resolution

The proportions of subjects who achieved a complete response for at least one target tophus by Month 12 were 25.5% and 30.3% versus 21.1% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo

groups respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. Results were similar for proportions achieving a complete or partial response (56.6% and 58.7% versus 50.5%, respectively).

By Month 12, reductions in the sum of the areas of all target tophi were observed in all groups. The mean % change from baseline at 12 months was 55.8% and 57.9% vs. 31.3% for lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively (observed cases). The differences between both lesinurad groups and placebo were statistically significant (p<0.05).

Gout flares

The rates of gout flares per subject that required treatment over the 6-month period from end of Month 6 to end of Month 12 were 1.4, 0.7 and 1.2 for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg ar placebo groups respectively. The rate for the lesinurad 400 mg group was statistically significa il lower than placebo (p<0.05).

The proportion of subjects requiring treatment for a gout flare between the end of Ment of Month 12 was 42.0%, 31.2% and 38.9% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad groups respectively.

Study 306 (add-on to allopurinol)

Of the 1213 subjects enrolled and randomized in Study 301 or Study 302, 718 were enrolled in Study 306, representing 59.2%. A total of 244 subjects who had received placebo were re-randomized to lesinurad 200 mg (n = 122) or 400 mg (n

122). For the interim analyses, 281 subjects in the LESU 200 mg + ALLO group and 275 subjects in the LESU 400 mg + ALLO group completed the full 12 months in the extension study, which was 45.8% of all subjects originally randomized in Studies 301 and 302.

Adding lesinurad to previous placebo nearly doubled the proportion of subjects that achieved the SUA target at all time-points / Study 306 (from 27.3% to 38.8% in placebo period to 61.3% to 75.9% when lesinurad was initiated. The response to prior lesinurad treatment was maintained in in the

Monotherapy Studies

Exploratory monotherapy Study 202

Monotherapy was explored in gout patients in Study 202, a 4 weeks randomised controlled multicentre study, with 4 study arms (lesinurad 200/400/600 mg and placebo). In total 127 subjects were randomised (1: 1: 1: 1 ratio) The proportions of subjects achieving SUA < 6.0 mg/dl at Day 27 were 7.4%, 27.6%, and 44.8% in the LESU 200, 400, and 600 mg groups, respectively, and 0% in the PBO

group (p < 0.01 for the LESU 400 and 600 mg groups when compared with PBO, but the difference for LESU 200 mg was not statistically significant). The incidence of elevated creatinine levels (> 1.5 times x baseline) was approximately two-fold higher in the LESU groups compared with PBO, but remained under 10%. Elevations were usually mild and resolved after discontinuation. No SAEs were reported.

Monotherapy Study 303

Study 303 was a confirmatory randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of lesinurad monotherapy in gout patients, who were intolerant of or had a contraindication to an XO-inhibitor. A total of 214 subjects were randomized to lesinurad (107 in each study arm), of which 162 (72 on lesinurad and 90 on placebo) completed the 6-month treat period. Non-responder imputation was applied for missing data.

By Month 6, significantly more subjects in the lesinurad 400 mg group achieved the target goal of SUA < 6.0 mg/dl compared with the Placebo group: 29.9% versus 1.9%, respectively (difference 28%, 95% CI 19-37, p < 0.0001).

In comparison to placebo, the lesinurad group had a higher proportion of subjects with kidney- associated TEAEs (23.4% versus 3.7%), kidney- associated TEAEs leading to discontinuation of randomized study medication (11.2% versus 0.9%), and kidney-associated SAEs (5.6% versus 0%).

2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy

Design and conduct of clinical studies

The clinical efficacy was supported by 3 Phase 3 pivotal studies (301, 302 and 304) investigating lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase) inhibitor for the treatment of gout. The Phase 3 program included both the 200 mg qd and 400 oses, both as monotherapy, and in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. However the applicant is not seeking approval for the 400 mg qd dose level, or for a monotherapy indication dueto renal safety considerations (see also Section 2.6, Clinical Safety of this Report).

Medicinal product no longer authorised.

The primary efficacy endpoint for the plotal studies is considered a surrogate endpoint. During a CHMP scientific advice procedure, it was agreed that sUA lowering could be an acceptable primary endpoint for the pivotal lesinurad studies.

Lesinurad is intended for yout patients with hyperuricaemia despite adequate urate lowering monotherapy. In studies of and 302, subjects were required to take allopurinol at a medically- appropriate dose for aNleast 8 weeks prior to screening. In study 304, subjects were eligible irrespective of the SVIA response to 3 weeks of febuxostat 80 mg daily. The CHMP noted that in these, only 7% of \Dieses were taking more than 300 mg daily of allopurinol at baseline and no patients received felkuxpstat 120 mg daily at baseline. The Applicant was therefore requested to provide further that the patient populations in the clinical trials were representative of the target

po

The Applicant responded that in clinical practice, despite prescribing information allowing for allopurinol daily doses of up to 900 mg for more than 5 decades in Europe, evidence from multiple studies shows that few patients (< 4%) are prescribed allopurinol doses higher than 300 mg daily. Retrospective analyses showed that 2.1% of 7,443 patients in the United Kingdom (UK), and 3.4% of 4006 patients in Germany received > 300 mg/day of allopurinol (Sarawate 2006, Annemans 2008). An electronic medical record-based pharmaco-epidemiologic study of gout patients, known as International Comorbidity and Resource Utilization Study of Gout (ICARUS), was conducted by the Applicant to assess disease control and comorbid conditions, health resource use, and healthcare costs in the US and Europe. The ICARUS study reported that only 3.7% of 19,886 patients with gout in the UK had

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 97/128

recorded doses of allopurinol > 300 mg, with even lower percentages with recorded daily allopurinol doses > 300 mg in both France (0.3% of 6,293 patients) and Germany (0.5% of 34,963 patients (Ardea Biosciences, data on file, 2015). These studies indicate that across Europe and the US, allopurinol 300 mg is the highest dose used by approximately 95% of patients, and doses of allopurinol > 300 mg are seldom used. In Studies 301 and 302 pooled, 7.1% (86 of 1,213) of subjects were on doses of allopurinol > 300 mg, which is greater than that observed in the studies using electronic medical records.

In Studies 301 and 302, a minimal allopurinol dose of 200 mg was permitted if patients had moderate renal impairment, as dose adjustments are recommended in this group based on potential side effects (Stamp 2012). Across both studies, 7.1% of subjects were receiving > 300 mg of allopurinol, which is nearly twice the proportion of patients in clinical practice receiving allopurinol doses > 300 mg (Sarawate 2006, Jennings 2014). Conservative allopurinol dosing in renal-impaired patients nas been recommended, with previous studies showing that approximately 75% of renal-impaired patients take doses < 300 mg/day (Jeyaruban 2015). Across Studies 301 and 302, greater than 60% (147 of 224) of subjects with moderate renal impairment were taking allopurinol 300 mg daly. The plasma exposure levels of allopurinol 300 mg in subjects with moderate renal insufficiency is comparable to 600 mg allopurinol plasma exposures levels observed in patients with norr renal function (Hande 1984). Thus, in effect, 232 patients (19.1%) of subjects across Studies 301 and 302 could be considered as receiving doses > 300 mg allopurinol because they were taking actual doses > 300 mg or had plasma exposures significantly > 300 mg allopurinol due comorbid moderate renal impairment.

Jonger auth

Evidence shows that few patients are prescribed febuxostat in Europe, and when febuxostat is prescribed, it is predominantly at the recommended 80 mg daily dose with limited prescribing of the 120 mg dose. Data from the IMS Midas database, a (ve)-established and widely used data source from IMS Health for global pharmaceutical and prescriing data, show that < 5% of urate lowering therapy prescriptions are for febuxostat. Across Europe in 2014, of those receiving febuxostat, 92% of standard unit sales were for 80 mg tablets versus 8% for 120 mg tablets (IMS Health, MIDAS, MAT 4Q 2014). These results were corroborated by data from the ICARUS pharmaco-epidemiologic study, which shows that few patients in Europe receive febuxostat at any dose (2.2% of all XO inhibitor use) and in these patients on febuxostat 10% were prescribed a dose of 120 mg (82 of 893 [9%] in France, 26 of 382 [7%] in Germany, and 1 of 90 [1%] in the UK). Thus, < 1% of all prescriptions for XO inhibitors was for feb xost 120 mg daily. The CHMP considering this information considered that the lesinurad clinical trials were representative of the target population. the patient populations

In fact around 50% of subjects in study 304 had UA > 5.0 mg/dl at baseline. The applicant however provided additional analyses for the subgroup with SUA > 6.0 mg/dl at baseline, in order to allow comparison with the outcomes of studies 301 and 302.

Efficacy data and additional analyses

Lesinurad in combination with allopurinol

Clinically relevant, as well as statistically significant, sUA lowering was demonstrated for lesinurad 200 mg qd or 400 mg qd in combination with allopurinol, compared to allopurinol alone. The effect was

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 98/128

consistent across sub-groups, including subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects receiving more than 300 mg allopurinol daily. The SUA lowering effect of lesinurad, in addition to allopurinol, is maximal by 1 month, and sustained throughout the 12 month study period.

Lesinurad in combination with febuxostat

Although the primary endpoint was not met for the 200 mg qd dose, Month 6 was the only timepoint at which the proportion meeting the sUA target was not significantly different from placebo. The proportions achieving SUA < 5.0 mg/dl were more strongly in favour of lesinurad at Month 12, and at Months 4, 5 and 6 combined. Furthermore, the sub-group of subjects with > 5.0 mg/dl at baseline despite 3 weeks of febuxostat monotherapy would be expected to benefit the most from combinado therapy. For this sub-group, the proportions with SUA < 5.0 mg/dl at Month 6 were 44.1% vs % (p<0.05) for the lesinurad 200 mg group vs placebo respectively.

Therefore, in subjects not responding to monotherapy with febuxostat 80 mg qd, there ) lesinurad 200 mg qd as add-on provides additional SUA lowering that is clinically relevant.

evidence that

Due to modest baseline sUA levels across all the trials, it was unclear whether Jesinurad is sufficiently effective in more resistant patients (e.g. sUA levels > 7-8mg/dl). However, the Applicant provided additional analyses to demonstrate that the combination of lesinurad with an XO inhibitor is efficacious in more resistant subjects, including those with higher Baseline SUA levels.

In Study 304, the Baseline SUA reflects 9 weeks of Sponsor-supplied febuxostat 80 mg daily. The CHMP concluded that the efficacy of lesmurad in these patients had been adequately demonstrated.

duct no longer to incant

Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that the initially proposed indication by the Applicant for the chronic treatment of hyperuricaemia in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat in gout patients when additional therapy is warranted

did not adequately reflect the intended second line treatment option for lesinurad. To more charly reflect this the CHMP recommended that lesinurad should be indicated in combination with axanthine oxidase inhibitor, for the adjunctive treatment of hyperuricaemia in gout o tionts (with or without tophi) who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone.

2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy

In allopun or non-responders, the additional treatment of lesinurad provided a significant and sustamo reduction of SUA levels below the treatment target of < 6.0 mg/dl or lower. The CHMP

acknowledged that as this was a surrogate endpoint, the clinical relevance of this effect was not clear as the improvement of flares and tophi reduction compared to placebo after 12 months was not statistically significant. However, the long-term efficacy data after 24 months of treatment, provided sufficient evidence of a clinical effect with continuous decline of the tophi load and flares.

The additional effect of lesinurad 200 mg on top of febuxostat 80 mg was modest. However a relevant effect was shown in a subgroup of non-responders to febuxostat which reflects the intended use of lesinurad as an add-on therapy in patients not achieving target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone.

2.6. Clinical safety

The clinical safety was supported by clinical studies of lesinurad monotherapy as well as combination therapy, and including doses greater than or equal to 200 mg qd. The Phase 3 core combination studies (301, 302 and 304) were placebo-controlled and provide the pivotal safety data. An updated Safety Report was also submitted to provide updated safety data from Studies 301, 302 and 304 with a data cut-off of 4 November 2014.

Renal safety was a particular focus due to the mechanism of action of lesinurad. Cardiovascular safety was also a particular concern for the gout patient population.

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was appointed to monitor potential safety during the Phase 3 clinical trial program. In addition, two independent and blinded Adjudica Committees were established,, one for review and adjudication of Cardiovascular Endpoint and one other for the adjudication of Renal Events (REAC). The Adjudication Commit seriousness of renal and CV events, and the likelihood whether the case were drug

The primary safety evaluation is based on data from the three pivotal randomised placebo-controlled trials (Studies 301 and 302 and Study 304) evaluating the efficacy and safety of lesinurad 200 mg and 400 mg qd in combination with an XO inhib tor for 12 months.

Additional safety data from the ongoing Phase 3 extension studies (Studies 306 and 307) of these 3 main studies were submitted.

Supportive safety data from the Phase 3 monotherapy program (Studies 303 and its OLE 305) and the Phase 2 studies (Studies 202 od 203) were also submitted.

For monotherapy with the 400 mg dose, the overall rate of AEs was similar as reported for the combination, although these occurred in a shorter time frame: 77.6/ within 6 months for monotherapy versus 79.8% in 12 months for the combination. The 'incidence of AEs was lower for placebo in the monotherapy study (65.4%), possibly as no background therapy with a XOI was provided. Of note, the rate of withdrawal of the study drugs que to AEs was considerable higher for monotherapy (18.7% versus 5.6% placebo), than the same dose in the XOI-combination studies (9.4% vs 5.4% placebo). Monotherapy with the 200mg dose was not evaluated.

Adverse Drug Reactions were identified from the core, placebo controlled Periods of Studies 301, 302 and 304, based on the comparative incidence of TEAEs. More specifically ADRs were considered those which were observed at incidences >2% for subjects in the lesind 200 mg + XOI group and >1% higher compared to the PBO + XOI group (Table 51).

In addition, the Applicant considered Renal Failure, Renal Impairment and Nephrolithiasis as potential adverse events because of the mode of action of lesinurad, which could cause local renal toxicity and uric acid c' Stals due to hyper-saturation of uric acid in the nephron. Analysis of these events is described in detail in under the Renal and Urinary Disorders SOC.

Adverse events in Phase 3 monotherapy studies

For the Phase 3 monotherapy study (303), the incidence of any TEAE was 77.6% and 65.4% in the lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. For any Grade 3 or 4 TEAE, the respective rates were 16.8% and 3.7%. For 'at least possibly related TEAEs', the respective rates were 29.9% and 10.3%.

In contrast to the pooled combination data, there were increased rates of TEAEs for lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC overall (77.5% vs 35.2%), mainly driven by

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

diarrhoea, nausea and constipation. There were increased rates of TEAEs for lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC overall, and particularly for renal impairment and renal failure. This was also reflected in the Investigations SOC (see Section 4.5).

When the Phase 3 monotherapy extension data is considered (study 305), the pattern of TEAEs is in line with that observed in the core phase. Regarding the SOC Renal and urinary disorders, there were 5 new reports of renal impairment, 4 new reports of renal failure and 6 new reports of PTs related to renal calculus.

When considering Grade 3 or 4 toxicities reported for the Phase 3 monotherapy study (303), the exposure-adjusted incidences were 41.2 events per 100 PY vs. 8.8 events per 100 PY in the placeo. group. This difference was explained mainly by increased rates of renal failure, renal failure and blood creatinine raised. A similar pattern was observed when extension data (study 305)

System Organ Classes (SOCs) of special interest are discussed below in detail.

REAC-adjudicated events

The Renal Events Adjudication Committee (REAC) reviewed pre-defined venal events (AEs in the SMQ for acute renal failure that were serious or led to discontinuation of randomised study medication) as well as all increases in sCr > 1.5 x baseline. Review and adjugatien were blinded to treatment allocation. For the Phase 3 core combination studies, the proportion of subjects with any adjudicated event was 6.5%, 14.9% and 3.3% in the lesinurad 200 mgresinurad 400 mg and placebo groups respectively. Of the events adjudicated, the proportion with at least one confounding factor with a moderate of high level of contribution were 36.1º 3% and 44.4% for the lesinurad 200 mg, lesinurad 400 mg and placebo groups.

Resolution of a sCr elevation was defined as a value ≤ 1.2 x Baseline following an elevation. This was based on the intra-subject variability of vaseline sCr values of approximately 22%. Estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula, using baseline age and ideal body weight. Other routine measurements were serum electrolytes. Urine was routinely monitored for glucose, ketones, oscult blood, and protein. Protein-creatinine ratios were provided for subjects with sCR elevattons.

The incidence of renal events was generally higher in elderly subjects, in those with lower Baseline renal function (eCrCl < 60), and in those with tophi at Screening.

In the pivotal XOI-combination trials, two-fold sCR elevations were reported in nine (1.8%), and 34 subjects (6.7%) in lesinurad 200 and 400 mg treatment groups, respectively, versus 0 in the Placebo arm. At lesinurad 200 mg dose, 88.9% (8/9) elevations were reported to be resolved, 66.7% (6/2 without interruption of lesinurad. The 400 mg dose, 80.0% (32/40) of these elevations were reported to be resolved, and 57.5% (23/40) without interruption of lesinurad. In the 200 mg dose armyabout 50% of the two-fold sCr elevation was resolved within 14 days, however, time to recover significantly longer for the 400 mg dose (Table 53).

Creatinine clearance

In the pivotal XOI-combination trials, the 400 mg dose was associated with a decline of eCrCl of -2.4% in Month 1 that remained stable to Month 12. No declining trend was observed for the 200 mg dose or placebo.

There were 2 subjects who had shifts in Protein-Creatinine ra io exceeding > 1.0 mg/mg together with sCr elevations, indicating tubular dysfunction (incomplete tubular reabsorption of proteins). Both cases occurred at the 400 mg dose. No trends of abnormal ities were observed for electrolytes or urinary parameters like proteinuria.

Long-term renal safety (24 months follow-up)

Lesinurad was more frequently associated with renal events than placebo by baseline renal function, in a dose dependent manner (Table 54). Lesinurad was also associated with an increased incidence of serum creatinine elevations 1.5 times baseline, most of which gradually resolved after treatment withdrawal. The incidence rate of renal events slightly increased at longer-term follow-up for the 200 mg dose (see Table 55 below). However, this was not the case for the 400 mg dose.

Case reports of CV adverts were sent to the Cardiovascular Endpoints Adjudication Committee (CEAC), to adjudicate their CV origin. Deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke were classified as MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events).

Baseline CV risk factors in the study population

According to the protocols, patients with hypertension and a history of cardiac disorder were eligible, provided that the disease and symptoms were adequately controlled, and the patient was in a reasonable physical condition (NYHA criteria I-II). Over 75% of the subjects had ≥ 1 CV comorbidity or CV risk factor at Baseline (Table 56).

In addition the majority of subjects had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (67.4% and 71.0% in the placebo and total lesinurad groups, respectively). About 17% of the total study population had a BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 with similar distribution over the treatment arms.

Overall, the rates of subjects with adverse cardiac events were reported to be similar for Placebo and lesinurad (3.3% (n=17) and 4.3% (n=22) for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, versus 3.9

Placebo). However, about 60 % of these cases were reported to be severe for le

Furthermore, the observed cardiovascular mortality rate in lesinurad-treated subjects (0.48/100 PYE; ) in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies was in the expected range based on data obtained in an analysis of gout patients in the UK (matched for age, gender, and other key entry criteria), which was performed by an independent epidemiologist. Results of this analysis indicated a predicted total mortality and ischemic heart disease event rates of 1.17/100 PYE and 1.2/100 PYE, respectively.

SOC Hepatobiliary disorders

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 109/128

Hepatobiliary safety was considered of special interest, as DILI (drug induced hepatotoxicity) has been reported for benzbromarone, another uricosuric drug with the same mode of action as lesinurad.

At routine monitoring, there were no notable differences in liver enzymes increments in the lesinurad treatment arms versus placebo. In addition, no cases of DILI (meeting Hy's law) were observed for lesinurad in the total safety database.

AEs of the Hepatobiliary disorders domain were slightly more frequently reported for lesinurad (2.3% for the 200mg dose, 1.5% for the 400mg dose and 1.2% for Placebo), with hepatic steatosis and biliary events (including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis , bile duct stone, cholecystitis) as the most common reported events in this category. Moreover, three hepatobiliary events including acute cholecystitis and bile duct stone were classified as Serious Adverse Events for lesinurad, but n placebo. However, at long-term follow-up for 24 months, no increasing trend of hepatobilia or signals of bile duct hyperplasia-was observed.

SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders The overall incidence of this SOC was 8.3%

for 200 mg sinurad 200 and 100 mg (0,6%) for our versus 2 subje dates de dose, 9.8% for 400 mg dose, and 7% for placebo. This difference was mainly aynouted to a higher incidence of the PT Type 2 Diabetes (10 subjects (2.0%) & 8 subjects (1.8%) 400 mg, versus 3 subjects (0.6%) for placebo), and the PT Diabetes Mellitus subjects (1.4 %) & 3 subjects (0.6%) for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, versus 2 subjects (0.4%) for placebo).

Notably, dehydration was also reported more frequently for active toza ment (4 cases (0.8%) and 5 cases (1.0%) versus 2 cases (0.4%) for placebo). Moreover, two dehydration cases for active treatment were considered serious, versus none for Placebo.

SOC Gastrointestinal disorders: GI disorders were commeonly reported (18% 200 mg dose, 20.2% high 400 mg dose, and 17.2% for placebo). Gastro-intestinal intolerability was common in the preclinical studies at high doses. Except for Gastro-Resophagal Reflux (2.7%, 1.4% versus 0.8%) and Abdominal Discomfort (2.7%, 1.4% versus 0 8%), no obvious trends of GI intolerability were observed in the Phase III studies (diarrhoea 4.5%, 5

SOC Investigations: Overall, the rate of positive investigations was higher for the 400 mg dose (23.3%), versus the lower lesinured 200 mg dose (16.6%) and placebo (17.8%). This was mainly caused by over-reporting of hope creatinine increments for the High lesinurad dose (7.8%), versus 4.3% for the low dose, and 2.5% for placebo.

Serious adverse events and deaths

The overall incidente of SAEs was lower for the 200 mg group than for the placebo group in the pivotal randomised als, but increased in the 400 mg group (Table 61).

The incidence of renal SAE was twice as high at 400 mg dose as compared zo placebo (1.6% versus 0.8%), whereas none occurred at the recommended 200 g dose. The renal SAEs included renal failure and nephrolithiasis.

The causes of SAE were quite heterogeneous in the placebo arm. However, for lesinurad 200 and 400 mg, the far most common SAE was a cardiac disorder, in contrast to placebo (2.0% (10 subjects) and 2.7% (14 subjects), versus 0.4% (2 subjects) for placebo. Myocardial infarction, coronary disorders reported SAE's for lesinurad.

Deaths

In total, 13 deaths were reported. Eleven deaths were adjudicated by the independent assignment committee CEAC as a MACE (Major Adverse Ardiovascular Event). The remaining 2 deaths were due to non-cardiovascular causes (suicide Gastric cancer). All the deaths occurred in male subjects, with the youngest being 37 years pulmonary thromboembolism) and the oldest being 78 years old (pulseless electrical activity). None the deaths were considered to be treatment-related by the CEAC.

Notably, all fatal MACE posts occurred on active treatment with lesinurad, and none on placebo. Six fatal MACE cases (five po combination therapy, one on monotherapy) occurred in the 6-12 months placebo-controlled period in the randomised studies, versus 0 in the corresponding placebo arms (pooled Study 203)301, 302, 303, 304). Another three fatal MACE cases occurred shortly (7-48 days) after the parents switched from prior 12 months of placebo to active treatment. The two remaining fatal CV Cases occurred on continued use of lesinurad in the open-label extension period after the 12

Laboratory findings

Haematology screening

The following haematology parameters were routinely monitored: Haematocrit, Haemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, erythrocyte count, and White Blood Cell count (differential). Overall, the post-Baseline shifts to abnormal values was low and similar between treatment arms (<2%), and the mean levels of these parameters remained stable over the observed treatment period.

Clinical chemistry screening

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 111/128

Routine screening was performed of ALT, AST, bilirubin, direct bilirubin, sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, CK, and lipids (cholesterol, and triglycerides). No notably difference was observed.

Enhanced creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels were reported frequently, but were equally distributed over treatment arms (4.5, 5.9 and 4.8% for the 200/400 mg lesinurad and placebo groups respectively).

Vital signs

No notable differences were reported for blood pressure and heart rate at routine monitoring The changes from baseline were reported at a similar rate among lesinurad and placebo (data not show

No other meaningful signals of abnormal investigations were observed. E.g. liver enzyme were rarely reported, at an equal rate for active treatment or placebo.

Subjects ≥ 65 years of age had a higher incidence of Cardiac Disorders compared to subjects < 65 years of age across all treatment groups including placebo (8.8%-11.7% (lesinurad 200-400 mg) vs 12.3% placebo in elderly, and 2.6-3.0% versus 2.5% in placebo group, in subjects < 65 year). There

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions

Lesinurad has been shown to be a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 based on in vitro data and clinical DDI studies. To investigate implications for safety, the applicant submitted a pre-planned analysis of the impact of lesinurad on concomitant CYP3A4 substrates during Phase 3, specifically anti- cholesterol (Table 63) and anti-hypertensive medications (Table 64).

Phase 3 combination extension studies (306 and 307)

Overall, there was no change in the pattern of exposure-adjusted rates of discontinuation compared to the core studies. For the Renal and urinary disorders SOC there were additional TEAEs leading to

discontinuations during the extension phase: 5 in the lesinurad 200 mg group and 4 in the lesinurad 400 mg group.

Monotherapy studies

The exposure-adjusted rates of discontinuation of randomised study medication were significantly higher for the lesinurad 400 mg group compared to placebo during the core monotherapy study (303): 48.5 per 100 PY vs. 13.2 per 100 PY. This was predominantly due to a higher rate of discontinuations for lesinurad in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, including PTs for renal failure, renal impairment and calculus. During the extension study (305), there were a further 7 TEAEs in the Renal and urinary disorders SOC, in addition to the 9 reported in the lesinurad 400 mg group during the core study There were also an additional 5 reports of Blood creatinine increased which led to discontinuat the extension phase, in addition to the 2 reports in the lesinurad 400 mg group of the core During the extension study, there was a new TEAE of hypersensitivity leading to discontinuation of lesinurad. During the Phase 2 monotherapy study (202), there were 2 AEs leading to di continuation, including a report of Blood creatinine increased in the lesinurad 400 mg group. via the extension phase of study 202, a further 6 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported, including 4 reports of Blood creatinine increased.

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety

Patient exposure

roduct no longer authorised

The safety population was sufficiently large to draw conclusions regarding the presence of common adverse events. The CHMP noted that the over 75s were relatively under-represented in the clinical safety database and this is reflected in the SmPC which states that therapeutic experience in patients 75 years and older is limited. Caution should be used when treating these patients.

Renal safety

Because of lesinurad's mode of action which causes an increase in renal uric acid excretion, and may lead to transient increases in serum carne, renal-related adverse reactions and kidney stones renal function and signals of renal damage wore routinely monitored throughout the study program. In general, the incidence of renal Ats in the main XOI-combination studies increased with the dose (i.e. 5.7% at the 200 mg dose and 1.3% for 400 mg dose, versus 4.5% at placebo), and further increased in lesinurad monotherapy (17.% for the 400 mg dose). Furthermore, the renal adverse events were more severe in the 400 mg dose group and in monotherapy, with higher frequencies of renal SAE (1- 4.7%, respectively) when compared to the 200 mg dose. No renal SAE were reported for the 200 mg dosing regimen evident symptoms and the renal cases consist primarily of laboratory abnormalities without clinical which resolved without treatment discontinuation.

Medicinal

In three month placebo-controlled trials of lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor versus placebo, serum creatinine elevations between 1.5-fold and 2-fold over baseline occurred in 3.9% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg, 10.0% of patients on lesinurad 400 mg and 2.3% on placebo; serum creatinine elevations 2-fold or greater over baseline occurred in 1.8% of patients on lesinurad 200 mg, 6.7% of patients on lesinurad 400 mg and 0% on placebo. These serum creatinine elevations generally resolved, most without treatment interruption. Renal-related adverse reactions were reported in patients treated with lesinurad 200 mg (5.7%) and lesinurad 400 mg (11.8%) compared to placebo (4.5%), resulting in discontinuation of treatment in 1.2%, 3.3% and 1%, respectively. The most frequent renal-related adverse reaction was blood creatinine increased (4.3% with lesinurad 200 mg and 7.8% with lesinurad 400 mg compared to 2.3% with placebo).

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 115/128

The CHMP therefore recommended that the dose is limited to 200 mg, and that lesinurad must be co- administered at the same time as the morning dose of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, i.e. allopurinol or febuxostat, as a precautionary measure to prevent urinary uric acid overload. Lesinurad dosing must be interrupted if treatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor is interrupted.

To further minimise the potential for renal adverse events the CHMP recommended that renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of lesinurad and monitored periodically thereafter, e.g. 4 times per year, based on clinical considerations, such as baseline renal function, volume depletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. Patients with serum creatinine elevations to greater than 1.5 times the baseline value should be closely monitored. Lesinurad treatment should be interrupted if serum creatinine is elevated to greater than 2 times the pre-treatment value or in case of an absolute serum creatinine value greater than 4.0 mg/dL. Treatment should also be interrupted in patients who report symptoms that may indicate acute uric acid nephropathy including flank pain, nausea or vomiting, and measure serum creatinine promptly. Finally, lesinurad should not be restarted if another explanation for the serum creatinine abnormalities cannot be deducted. Th recommendations are reflected in the SmPC.

Data from the long-term goon label Phase 3 extension studies revealed a renal safety profile consistent with that observed in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies.

Medicinal product no longer authors

The totality of the long-term safety dataset does not suggest that treatment with the low dose of lesinurad would induce severe renal don age at the long term. Although there was a slight increment of the incidence rates of the 200 mg dose at longer term follow-up till 2-3 years, this was not observed for the 400 mg dose. Most AEs consisted of mild and temporary increments of serum creatinine. Neither a signal of deterioration of the mean creatinine clearance, nor a signal of proteinuria was observed in the 200 mg dose group after 2 years' of follow-up. More importantly, no significant deterioration of renal fi tion was noted in patients with mild-moderate renal impairment at baseline.

However, given thatexperience with lesinurad in patients with an estimated CrCL less than 45 mL/min is limited, the CAMP Precommended that lesinurad should not be used in patients with severe renal less than 30 mL/min), end stage renal disease, kidney transplant recipients or impairment patients lialysis and used with caution in patients with a CrCL from 30 mL/min to less than 45

mL/m

In addition, the CHMP requested that the safety and efficacy of lesinurad in patients with moderate renal impairment with CrCl 30-45 mL/min should be further investigated and the Applicant has included a study in the RMP in order to address this request.

Cardiovascular safety

Cardiovascular co-morbidities are common in gout patients, and this was also reflected by the study population, which had a high prevalence of hypertension, obesity and diabetes.

The overall cardiac events reporting rates were similar among placebo and the lesinurad treatment arms. However, cardiac events were 5-7 times more frequently reported as a SAE for the lesinurad

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 116/128

treatment, in comparison with placebo. Not only the severity, but also the nature of the cardiac events was different, with more cases of myocardial infarction and cardiac fatalities for lesinurad, and primarily arrhythmia cases in the placebo arm. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled combination therapy clinical studies, the incidences of patients with adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) per 100 patient- years of exposure were: 0.71 (95% CI 0.23, 2.21) for placebo, 0.96 (95% CI 0.36, 2.57) for lesinurad 200 mg, and 1.94 (95% CI 0.97, 3.87) for lesinurad 400 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. However, the CHMP considered that a causal relationship with lesinurad and these events was not established, especially as all patients with a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event treated with lesinurad 200 mg had a history of heart failure, stroke or myocardial infarction.

Furthermore, the observed cardiovascular mortality rate in lesinurad-treated subjects in the pyofal Phase 3 combination therapy studies was in the expected range based on data obtained of gout patients in the UK (matched for age, gender, and other key entry criteria), which was performed by an independent epidemiologist. Results of this analysis indicated a predicted total mortality and ischemic heart disease event rates of 1.17/100 PYE and 1.2/100 % respectively in these patients. These rates are similar to the observed rates in lesinurad-treated subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 combination therapy studies.

authorised

Nevertheless, CHMP noted that lesinurad has not been studied in patients with unstable angina, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure, uncontroweg hypertension or with a recent event of myocardial infarction, stroke, or deep venous thrombosis within the last 12 months and therefore considered that lesinurad treatment is not recommended'in these patients. For cardiovascular patients in a stable condition, the benefi risk balance should be assessed for each individual patient on an ongoing basis, taking into account the benefits of lowering urate levels versus Kk alan a potential increase in cardiac risk.

In addition, to further characterise the cardiovascular risks associated with lesinurad use, especially in patients at high risk, such as those with a history of cardiovascular events, the CHMP recommended that the Applicant should conduct an observational study post-authorisation and that this study should be a condition of the marketing authon.

Hypertension was the most frequentl increased and blood greatly reduced uso se Events Medicinal productsno cardiovascular reported adverse event in the lesinurad cores studies, with a higher incidencein the 200 mg and 400 mg groups compared to the placebo group (6. 1% and 6.9% versus ,8%, respectively). However the CHMP noted that in the more informative "Hypertension Standardo MedDRA Query (SMQ)", which includes terms such as blood pressure Sure systolic increased the difference in the incidence of these events was very small differences between the recommend 200mg dose and the placebo groups (6.50% and).2%, respectively). The CHMP therefore recommended that hypertension should not be cons deed an ADR and therefore is not included in the product's SmPC.

Other

The following TEAEs were reported with an incidence > 1%, and more commonly for lesinurad 200 mg and lesinurad 400 mg compared to placebo: influenza, headache, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux and blood creatinine increased. The incidence of serious infections requiring hospitalisation was similar between lesinurad and placebo. No viral infections like herpes zoster were reported, indicating that the immune system was not compromised. Overall, the CHMP considered that these safety issues were sufficiently addressed by listing influenza, headache, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux and blood creatinine increased in the ADR table of section 4.8, and that no additional warnings were required in this respect.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 117/128

Other potential adverse events that the CHMP noted was dehydration, which was reported as serious AEs for lesinurad only, and three cases of chronic pyelo-nephritis in the 400 mg dose arm. Considering the mode of action of lesinurad, causality could not be excluded for this adverse event and the CHMP recommended that dehydration should be listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the SmPC states that patients should be instructed to stay well hydrated (e.g. 2 litres of liquid per day) whilst on lesinurad treatment.

In preclinical models, drug-induced bile duct hyperplasia was observed. A small number of cases of hepatobiliary events were reported for lesinurad. However, there was no increasing trend of hepatobilary after 24 months follow-up.

Enhanced creatinine phosphokinase (CK) levels were reported frequently, but were equally disputed over treatment arms (4.5, 5.9 and 4.8% for the 200/400 mg lesinurad and placebo groups respectively). The CHMP considered that this could be explained by the co-medication colchicine, which was administered to about 85% of the study population to prevent ULT-induced flares and which is known to induce CK.

Patients with severe hepatic impairment

As there are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment, the CHMP noted that no dose recommendations can be made for these patients. However, the CHMP also considered that there is currently no urgent need for additional PK studies in this populationvas severe hepatic impairment is rare in gout patients, and the PK studies in moderate hepatic impairment did not indicate a significant effect.

Drug-drug Interactions

Medicinal productno longer authorised

Based on available in vitro and clinical data the CHMR concluded that mild induction of CYP3A by lesinurad may reduce plasma exposures of co-administered medicines that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A. In the pivotal clinical trials, a greater proportion of patients using lipid lowering or anti- hypertensive medications that were CYP3A Substrates required concomitant medication change when treated with lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, compared with patients treated with placebo in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (35% versus 28%, respectively). In Section 4.5 of the ShPC stipulates that the possibility of reduced efficacy of concomitant medications that are CYP3A substrates should be considered and their efficacy (e.g. blood pressure and cholesteroNevel should be monitored.

2.6.2. Conclusi on the clinical safety

The use of lesingratl is associated with the risk of hyper-saturation of uric acid in the urine, which may be damaging o the renal tissue. However, it has been shown that this risk can be largely attenuated by precauvondry measures, such as a limitation of the lesinurad dose to 200 mg, and the concurrent Inhibitors. In addition, routine monitoring of the renal function is proposed in the SmPC.

Available data also point towards an increased risk of severe cardiac events including myocardial infarction and fatalities in patients with a prior history of CV events. Since cardiovascular co-morbidity is common in the intended target population, the CHMP considered that that any potential increase in cardiovascular risk could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk balance of lesinurad. The CHMP therefore recommended that the risk of CV events in association with lesinurad use should be further evaluated through a post-authorisation safety study which should be a condition of the authorisation.

Meanwhile, adequate warnings have been included in the SmPC to use lesinurad with caution in stable CV compromised patients -and not to use lesinurad in patients with unstable and recent CV disorders, as there is no experience in this group.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 118/128

Other adverse drug drugs associated with lesinurad used were headache, influenza, increased blood creatinine and gastric reflux. These events were in general mild and did not lead to treatment withdrawal and are considered manageable with routine risk minimisation measures, and are reflected in the SmPC.

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety:

In order to investigate the cardiovascular risk in association with lesinurad exposure, mainly in patients with a history of cardiovascular disorders, the Applicant shall conduct and submit the results of an observational prospective study according to an agreed protocol.

3 Benefit-Risk Balance

Benefits

Beneficial effects

Lesinurad as an add-on therapy to allopurinol or febuxostat, has shown a robust an sustainable SUA lowering effect in patients with insufficient response to allopurinol or febuxostat alone, at the aimed lesinurad 200 mg daily dose.

In two identically designed randomised trials in patients who did not receive their SUA treatment target level after 10 weeks of allopurinol 300 mg or more, 54.8% in the lesinurad 200 mg group and 25.6%

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 122/128

in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint of SUA < 6 mg/dl in Month 6 (difference versus placebo: 29% (95% CI: 23-36), pooled data Study 301+302). The SUA lowering effect below the target of 6 mg/dl was sustainable, as shown by higher percentage of subjects that achieved a SUA level < 6 mg/dl in Month 4,5,6 -the primary endpoint for other ULT product approved by the CHMP- and in Month 12, in favour of lesinurad (see benefits-risks table below). In those subjects who continued treatment for 24 months (about 45% of the randomised population), the percentage of subjects experiencing flare rates decreased to approximately 0-5% at Month 12, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis.

Furthermore, in a randomised trial in gout patients with visible tophi at baseline (Study 304), the addition of lesinurad 200 mg to febuxostat 80 mg lead to a significant increment of responder rates of SUA < 5 mg/dl in month 6, in a subgroup of patients who did not already achieve this SUA tarvet level after 3 weeks lead-in treatment of febuxostat 80 mg monotherapy (44.1% versus 23.5% nce 21% (95% CI 3, 38). In long-term extension Study 307, the total tophi area continued to decline from baseline till 24 months by -70%. The percentage of patients with complete resolution of tophi steadily increased from 26.6% at Month 12, to 53.1% at Month 24 for lesinurad 200 mg+ febuxostat.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects

Although the primary endpoint of lowering SUA below the target level was met for lesinurad , the clinical relevance of this surrogate outcome was not supported by spr gout flares, tophi resolution, which were not statistically different hom placebo at Month 12.

e secondary endpoints regarding

Only the 200 mg dose is proposed in the labelling, because o renat safety reasons. A higher response was noted for the 400 mg dose regarding the primary endpoints, i.e. the proportion of patients achieving the target SUA level at Month 6. However, the long-term efficacy data after 24 months of treatment, provided sufficient evidence of a clinical effect with continuous decline of the tophi load and flares.

Medicinal product no longer authoris

The additional effect of lesinurad 200 mg on top of febuxostat 80 mg was modest. However a relevant effect was shown in a subgroup of non-responders to febuxostat which reflects the granted indication of lesinurad as an add-on therapy in patients not achieving target serum uric acid levels with an adequate dose of a xanthine oxidase nibitor alone.

Risks

Unfavourable effects

Renal

Due to the uricosur mechanism of action of lesinurad, there is a potential risk of hyper-saturation of (i.e. hyperuricosuria) associated with its use, which could lead to renal toxicity events. The trials submitted in support of this application, demonstrated that limiting the lesinurad dose Omg and administering in combination with a XOI the risk of renal events can be greatly recescet. Most renal related adverse events consisted of sCr elevations, which often resolved without treatment interruption.

Serious events like e.g. acute renal failure and nephrolithiasis rarely occurred (lesinurad 200 mg + XOI 0% versus 0.4% XOI + Placebo); nephrolithiasis (0.6% vs 1.7%). Furthermore, the long-term follow- up database of 24 months indicate that renal function (mean CrCL) remained stable from baseline for the 200 mg dose treatment group, whereas a small decline was noted for the 400 mg dose arm. Only 1.2% left the study prematurely, because of renal adverse events in the low dose group. Moreover, recovery was delayed at the higher dose. At lesinurad 200 mg dose, 50% of the sCr elevations were reported to be resolved within two weeks, often without treatment interruption of lesinurad. In contrast, about 60% of the sCr increment cases did not recover within a month for the 400 mg dose.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 123/128

Renal adverse events could occur at any time during lesinurad treatment. In the SmPC, it is recommended that renal function will be monitored 4 times a year, based on clinical considerations, such as prior renal function of the patient, volume depletion, concurrent illness or concomitant medications. Patients with serum creatinine elevations to greater than 1.5 times the pre-treatment value should be closely monitored.

Cardiovascular

Although the overall rates of cardiac AEs were similar between study treatment arms, an imbalance was noted regarding cardiac Serious AEs in a dose dependent way (lesinurad 200 mg 2.0%, lesinurad 400 mg 2.7%, Placebo 0.4%). The incidence of MACE (Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) increased with the dose: (0.71 0.23, 2.21) per 100 patient- years for placebo, 0.96 (95% CI 0.36, 2.57) for lesinurad 200 mg, 1.94 (95% CI 0.97, 3.87) for lesinurad 400 mg, when used in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

Special populations

Renal impaired patients

Renal impairment is common in gout. About 20% of the study population moderate renal impairment (< 60 ml/min) at baseline. Notably, no trend of increased renal risk was observed for lesinurad as compared to placebo in patients with moderate renal noirment at baseline (10.5% in the PBO + XOI group versus 7.8% in the LESU 200 mg + XOI XOI group). Long-term safety has been established as well considering that a small trend of improvement of CrCl (+1.99 ml/min, SD 8.9) was observei the subgroup with moderate renal impairment at baseline, after two year continued treatment with lesinurad 200 mg.

Post-hoc analyses in a subgroup of 162 carmovescular compromised patients at baseline, showed that the incidence of MACE was 7.6% (4/53) f sinurad 200 mg compared to 1.9% (1/52) for placebo. A warning has been included in the Smp cardiovascular compromised patie Wat lesinurad should be used with caution in stable d should not be used at unstable CV conditions.

Elderly

In the pivotal XOI-combination studies, about 14% of the subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. Elderly had a higher incidence of carac disorders compared to subjects < 65 years of age across all treatment groups including placebo (8.8%-11.7% (lesinurad 200-400 mg) vs 12.3% placebo in elderly, and 2.6- vo IN placebo group, in subjects < 65 year).

populations

The clinical data from patients in the low range of moderate renal impairment (i.e. CrCl 30-45 ml/min) were sparse (26 were randomised to lesinurad 200 mg, and 29 to the 400 mg dose). Clinical data in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min) are lacking. A contra-indication regarding the use of lesinurad in patients with severe renal impairment has been included in the SmPC. In addition, the safety and efficacy of lesinurad in these patients will be further evaluated in a phase 4-randomised double-blind, placebo controlled study as described in the RMP.

There is also no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. This has been adequately addressed in the RMP where further information in these patients will be collected post-marketing.

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 124/128

Patients with unstable or severe CV patients (e.g. NYHA class III-IV), were excluded from the trials and therefore there is no experience about the magnitude of risks in these patients. Therefore, a strict warning has been included in the SmPC that lesinurad treatment is not recommended in these patients. Moreover, a post-authorisation study will be performed to further evaluate CV risks. Due to the high rates of CV co-morbidities in this population any increase in the CV risk could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk balance of Zurampic and therefore the CHMP considered that this study should be a condition of the authorisation.

There was limited experience in very elderly. Only 34 subjects were older than 74 years of age. This is included as missing information in the RMP and appropriate warnings in the SmPC about the limited experience with lesinurad treatment in this population.

Balance

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects

Lesinurad in combination with a XOI, promptly and robustly reduced the SUA below the treatment target level in (tophaceous) gout patients, who were insufficient responders to allopurinol or febuxostat. Efficacy of lesinurad has been confirmed in patients with a limited uricosuric capacity at baseline, secondary to moderate renal impairment or the use of thiazide diuretics.

The size of the tophi and the flare rates continued to decrease at treatment prolongation till 24 months. In those subjects who continued treatment for 24 months, the percentage of patients with flares decreased to nearly zero, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis.

Due to its mode of action, lesinurad may cause hyper-saturation of uric acid in the urinary trat as a consequence renal damage.

And

A small signal of serious cardiovascular complications was noted for lesinurad in a dose related way. Post-hoc subgroup analyses in cardiovascular compromised patients at baseline incidence of MACE was numerically higher for lesinurad than placebo.

Benefit-risk balance

Discussion on the benefit-risk balance

Benefits

Lesinurad 200 mg in combination with a XOI effectively reduced the SUA levels in gout patients who did not achieve their SUA treatment targets with allopurinol or febuxostat alone. The SUA lowering effect of lesinurad was prompt and robust. The responder rates of patients achieving their target SUA level (<5-6 mg/dL) were double those compared to placebo. No apparent tolerance to its pharmacodynamic effects on the URAT-1 receptor occurred, since efficacy was maintained throughout the 12 months placebo-controlled period and thereafter.

Clinical relevance of the treatment eff

Although lesinurad significantly reduce SUA levels, no clear clinical benefits were shown regarding the reduction of flares and tophi ? Month 6 and 12. This may be due to the fact that the introduction of hetnurad, initially increase the flare rates. It is thought that a sudden

reduction of the sUA ley As causes dissolution of the uric acid crystals, which may trigger an inflammatory host se. Another reason may be carry-over effect of colchicine, an anti- inflammatory drug, which was given as a flare prophylaxis for 5 months in the trials. This may have limited the difference between lesinurad and placebo at the 12-months endpoint.

Furthermore the percentage of patients with complete resolution of tophi steadily increased from a Month 12, to 53.1% at Month 24. A lower tophus burden is expected to lead to a reduced number of flares. The mean percentage of patients who experienced a flare decreased to nearly zero, at longer term treatment till 24 months, without the help of colchicine prophylaxis. This could be considered as a clinically relevant reduction.

Risks

Renal safety

Because of its mode of action to promote the urinary excretion of UA, hyperuricosuria may occur. High level of UA in the urinary system may cause local damage and nephrotoxicity. It was noted in the Phase III program that lesinurad monotherapy and at the high 400 mg dose, were more commonly associated with an increased risk of renal related events, than at the use of the low 200 mg dose in

Assessment report EMA/6459/2016

Page 126/128

combination with a XOI. Concurrent use of XOIs, which act by reducing the endogenous production of UA, diminish the urinary UA load and consecutively the occurrence of high peak UA levels and renal toxic events. Based on these findings, the lesinurad dose was limited to 200 mg, and lesinurad have to be taken together with a XOI. In addition, routine monitoring of the renal function should be applied throughout treatment.

The use of lesinurad in renal impaired patients

Thus far, there is limited experience in patients with moderate renal impairment CKD Stage 3b (eCrCl 30 to 45 mL/min)). A warning regarding the limited experience in patients with a CrCl 30-45 ml/min is reflected in the SmPC which states that lesinurad should be used with caution in this group. However, considering the complicated PK-PD relationship of lesinurad in renal impairment and the obser heterogenicity in PK-PD, safety and efficacy will be further established in this special group marketing setting.

Patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30/min) were excluded from the trials and the use of lesinurad in this special population is contra-indicated in the SmPC.

Cardiac safety

A signal of increased CV events like myocardial infarction in a dose dependent fashion was observed in association with lesinurad use. It is noted that gout patients are a population at risk of CV events, and more than 60% of the study population had one or more risk factors like obesity, or were treated for background risk could not fully hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes at baseline. Howey

explain the occurrence of MACE in the lesinurad trials, sing ettown risk-factors like a prior history of CV events, renal impairment and high age, were equally stibuted over the study arms. Moreover, post-hoc analyses showed that the risk of MACE was myher for lesinurad than placebo in patients with a prior history of CV events at baseline.

Overall, the number of MACE cases in the trian was considered low to draw definitive conclusions regarding the exact magnitude of CV risk

thlesinurad, and another study in a larger population will be performed in post-authorisation se ting jo address this concern.

In addition, the potential cardiovascular risks have been adequately addressed by limiting the maximum recommend dose to 200 mg and warnings in the SmPC against the use of lesinurad in CV compromised patients.
