Spectrila is usually employed as part of combination chemotherapy protocols with other antineoplastic
agents (see also section 4.5 of SmPC).
The recommended intravenous dose of asparaginase is 5,000 units per square metre (U/m2) body
surface area (BSA) given every third day.
Treatment may be monitored based on the trough serum asparaginase activity measured three days after
administration of Spectrila. If asparaginase activity values fail to reach target levels, a switch to a
different asparaginase preparation could be considered (see section 4.4).
The daily amount of Spectrila needed per patient can be diluted in a final volume of 50 - 250 ml sodium
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9 %) solution for injection. The diluted solution of asparaginase may be infused over
0.5 to 2 hours. Asparaginase must not be administered as a bolus dose (see SmPC section 4.2).
2.2. Quality aspects
2.2.1. Active Substance
General information
Asparaginase is an enzyme obtained from Escherichia coli (E. coli) which converts asparaginase to
aspartic acid and ammonia. The active substance, recombinant asparaginase, differs from wild type (wt)
asparaginase at four amino acid positions. The active substance asparaginase (asparaginase
aminohydrolase) appears as white crystals and is freely soluble in water. It is active as a homotetramer,
with a total molecular mass of 138,368 Da (approximately 35 kDa per monomer).
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
The active substance is manufactured according to standard techniques for the bulk production of a
recombinant protein/medicinal product from E. coli using a plasmid expression system with a MCB and
WCB. The plasmid contains an engineered version of the wt gene leading to a protein with 4 amino acid
substitutions. Induction occurs by elevating the temperature which inactivates the repressor protein. The
pre-asparaginase produced (with signal peptide) is secreted by a cellular translocation mechanism during
which the signal peptide is cleaved post-translationally yielding mature asparaginase in the periplasm of
the cells. One vial of the WCB is used for the pre-fermentation culture which is then used to inoculate the
production culture. This is then followed by harvesting, homogenisation and filtration prior to purification
using sequential chromatography steps.
Description of Manufacturing Process
In summary; a pre-culture is developed from a vial of the WCB for the inoculation of the production
fermenter. The product is harvested by homogenisation of the cells and purified in three chromatographic
steps before being conditioned and filtered (0.2 um). A batch comprises the protein purified from a single
harvest derived from fermentation of one vial of the WCB. The culture broth is processed so that the batch
size consists of approximately 480 g of purified bulk active substance.
Description of upstream processing and fermentation
A frozen cryovial of the WCB is allowed to thaw at room temperature and the cells are then resuspended
by mixing. The contents of the cryovial are used to inoculate a pre-culture fermenter containing
fermentation medium which is qualitatively the same as that used for production fermentation. During
pre-culture fermentation, the cells are cultured under defined conditions. The pre-culture cell suspension
is then harvested and used to inoculate the production fermenter.
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015
Page 11/132
Following inoculation of the production fermenter, the cells are cultured under defined conditions in two
steps. In the first step (up to nutrient limitation), the cells multiply, while in the second step u-control
(additional nutrient feed) is switched on to enable high cell density fermentation.
The cells are allowed to grow in the fermenter at a defined temperature for a fixed time range, after which
time production of asparaginase is induced by a temperature shift. The fermentation process is
terminated by gradually reducing the temperature.
Description of downstream processing and purification
The fermentation broth is transferred to the downstream processing suite and processed further.
Homogenisation is performed in three cycles.
After sampling, the homogenate is subjected to tangential flow. Microfiltration is performed in three
steps:
1. diafiltration (1) against phosphate buffer,
2. concentration, and
3. diafiltration (2) against phosphate buffer.
The microfiltration permeate containing the active substance is concentrated. The ultrafiltration retentate
is then diafiltered against phosphate buffer and subsequently diluted. Clarification steps are performed
prior to loading the first chromatography step. AEC (anion exchange chromatography) is performed using
a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with
the AEC-loading material and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the
column. Elution is performed and the AEC main fraction is collected. CEC is performed in two separate
cycles using a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. In each cycle, half of the AEC main
fraction is used as the starting material. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with the conditioned
AEC main fraction and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the column. IPCs
tests are performed separately on the two CEC main fractions. Like CEC, HIC is performed in two separate
cycles using a liquid chromatography system at room temperature. The starting material for each HIC
cycle is one of the two CEC main fractions. Following equilibration, the column is loaded with the
conditioned CEC main fraction and unbound proteins and impurities are subsequently washed from the
column. The pooled HIC main fraction containing the active substance is recirculated from the diafiltration
vessel through an ultrafiltration unit.
Conditioning of the bulk active substance solution is performed in three steps:
1. Diafiltration (1) against WFI.
2. Concentration to the target final weight.
3. Diafiltration (2) against WFI.
Following conditioning, the bulk active substance solution is pumped through a filtration unit.
The filtered active substance is collected in a sterile bag and stored at 2 - 8℃ until being shipped to the
finished product manufacturer. Prior to storage, samples of the filtered drug substance solution are taken
for release testing.
Characterisation
Characterisation focused on analysis of the minor peaks around the main peaks from SEC and RP-HPLC
analysis. Peaks additional to the main peak have been categorised as product-related substances or
product-related impurities and are acceptably characterised. The product-related substances consist of
pre-peaks and post main peaks (RP-HPLC), 'group 1' and 'group 2' substances respectively. The activity

Effects on insulin release and glucose homeostasis have been described in numerous studies [Khan,
1969] [Lavine, 1980; Lavine 1984]; [Pou, 1991]; [Clausen, 1989].
Effects on the pancreas: Pancreatic toxicity occurs most likely due to an inhibition of insulin synthesis
caused by reduced levels of amino acids ASN and probably GLN. About 5 % of human adults treated with
ASNase develop overt pancreatitis that may be fatal. Fatal haemorrhagic pancreatitis after ASNase
therapy was reported in one dog which was treated for multicentric malignant lymphoma with ASNase
(12,000 U) [Hansen, 1983].
Effects on the liver: It is thought that one of the main reasons for ASNase toxicity is its glutaminase
activity. L-glutamine is the main form of nitrogen transportation in blood, and prolonged depletion of this
amino acid during asparaginase therapy causes serious biochemical disorders in the body, particularly in
liver [Capizzi, 1970; Oettgen, 1970). A glutaminase-free asparaginase with potent anti-lymphoma
activity isolated from Vibrio succinogenes was not hepatotoxic even after prolonged treatment [Durden,
1983].
Effects on coagulation: Several investigations show that ASNase treatment of acute lymphoblastic
leukaemia patients causes severe deficiency in antithrombin with the consequence of increased risk of
thrombosis. However, the mechanism responsible for the decrease of plasma antithrombin caused by
ASNase remains elusive [Hernandez-Espinosa, 2006]. Coagulation disorders can occur due to the
inhibition of protein synthesis caused by ASNase [Rogers, 1992].
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
The potential for drug interactions following co-administration with methotrexate,
1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, dexamethasone and vincristine has been described.
Co-administration with methotrexate (MTX)
ASNase inhibits protein synthesis and cell replication, thus, it may interfere with the action of MTX which
requires cell replication for its anti-neoplastic effect [Capizzi, 1974; Capizzi, 1981].
Co-administration with cytosine arabinoside (1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine; ara-C)
A schedule-dependent effect of ara-C and ASNase was observed both in vitro and in vivo. A sub-additive
therapeutic effect of simultaneous exposure of ASNase and ara-C was observed in the murine leukaemia
cell line L5178Y/asn -. The observed synergy was thought to be related to the timing of ASNase treatment
and the "optimal therapeutic effect" occurs when sequential ASNase is administered before the cells
recover from the ara-C effect [Schwartz, 1982].
Co-administration with dexamethasone
The incidence of osteonecrosis is as high as 20% in children treated for ALL. It is assumed that
glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DXM) are responsible for the induction of osteonecrosis. ASNase
hastened the occurrence of osteonecrosis which was observed as early as 4 weeks [Yang, 2009]. In a
mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis, the frequency of osteonecrosis after 6 weeks of
dexamethasone plus ASNase was comparable to that observed following 12 weeks of dexamethasone
alone.
Co-administration with vincristine (VCR)
ASNase decreases hepatic clearance of VCR, resulting in prolonged half-life and increased toxicity
[Rogers, 1989]. Experiments in dogs have shown that the toxicity of vincristine may be additive with that
of ASNase if both agents are administered concomitantly [Rogers 1989; Northrup 2002].
The effects of L-ASNase on hepatic clearance/metabolism of VCR may also be responsible for the
observed neurotoxicity when the two agents are co-administered [Martindale Monographs, 2002].
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015
Page 21/132
The combination of DEX with VCR and ASN resulted in a significantly higher exposure to DEX when
compared to DEX alone as observed in a panel of childhood ALL continuous xenografts derived from
primary patient biopsies (ALL-7 and ALL-19) [Szymanska, 2012].
2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics
The primary aim of the pharmacokinetic studies conducted was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
rASNase preparations compared to that of the reference product, Asparaginase 10000 E medac. The
preparations were generally administered as a single intravenous dose to mice and dogs. In addition, the
effects of the ASNase on serum levels of L-asparagine (ASN) were determined. Analytical methods and
pharmacokinetic studies conducted in dogs were performed in accordance with GLP.

In study MV6839, the pharmacokinetic profile of 5 different ASNase preparations was determined
following single i.v. injection in female mice (strain: NOD/SCID). Following the observed efficacy profile
in the mouse, the hypothesis was that aggregate content in the preparations could influence the
pharmacokinetic features and subsequently lead to different anti-leukaemic activity. Mice (n=27/group)
received a single i.v. injection (2,000 U/kg) of the ASNase preparations. Serum was analysed by means
of the NH3 assay [LPT 17488/03] and interpreted with a non- and three-compartment model.
Isolated aggregates from Asparaginase 10000 E medac (58 % aggregates) and the clinically used
Asparaginase 10000 E medac (20.5 % aggregates) had much longer retention times in mice (t1/2= 5.54
and 3.17 hours, respectively) in comparison to the three remaining rASNase preparations with a
proportion of only 0.4-1.0 % aggregates (t1/2 = about 1.3 hours). In line with these findings, higher AUC
and lower clearance values for high-aggregate content preparations (groups A 'Asparaginase Medac' and
B 'Aggregates (Asparaginase Medac)') were observed when compared to low-aggregate content
preparations (C 'tetramers (Asparaginase Medac)' - E 'rASNAse (bulk agent)'). Isolated aggregates from
Asparaginase 10000 E medac showed a 4-fold increase in half-life of ASNase activity as well as a
three-fold increased area under the curve (AUC) compared to isolated tetramers. Results of isolated
tetramers from Asparaginase 10000 E medac were clearly comparable with results obtained with both
batches of rASNase (groups D 'rASNase (MC0703)' and E 'rASNase (bulk agent)'). Furthermore, high AUC
values and slow elimination clearly correlated with the highest anti-leukaemic activity as determined in
the corresponding pharmacodynamic study previously described.
In study LPT 13106/2/01, the pharmacokinetic properties of rASNase (Batch MC0201) and Asparaginase
10000 E medac were compared in the beagle dog (n=3/group) following single i.v. administration at
1000U/kg. No mortality was observed during the 8-day follow-up/observation period. Once or repeated

the recommendations of ICH S6. In addition, in light of the therapeutic indication claimed, the
post-marketing experience gained with native asparaginase and its protein nature, the lack of
carcinogenicity study is acceptable. Overall, evidence from published data with asparaginase renders the
mutagenic, clastogenic and carcinogenic potential of asparaginase negligible (see SmPC section 5.3).
Following repeated administration in the rat and dog, histological examination of the testis and the ovary
did not reveal any pathological findings; however, given that the maximum dose administered to the dog
is below that proposed clinically (on a mg/m2 basis), and given the pharmacological activity of
asparaginase, an effect on fertility cannot be completely ruled out. Hence, Section 4.6 of the SmPC
advises both males and females to use effective means of contraception.
No investigation was performed on the influence of fertility and on the potential transfer of this agent to
breast milk; the proposed product should not used during lactation in humans. There is extensive
information available regarding the potential effects of E. coli asparaginase on embryofetal development.
The potential for growth retardation, an increased risk of malformations (including those of the central
nervous system, heart and skeletal system) and foetal death is evident from the ex vivo and in vivo
studies performed at doses that are similar to or in excess of those proposed clinically (on a U/m2 basis)
in a number of species including the mouse, rat and/or rabbit. The potential for a risk to embryofetal
development is reflected in Section 5.3 of the SmPC. Section 4.6 of the SmPC advises that patients shall
use contraceptive measures during and up to 3 months after cessation of rASNase containing
chemotherapy and also warns against the use of the proposed product during pregnancy; overall, this
approach is acceptable. It is agreed that based on the information available in the public domain that no
further non-clinical data to describe the effects on embryofetal development are warranted.
A series of studies have been conducted in order to assess the local tolerance following intravenous,
paravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial and subcutaneous administration of recombinant asparaginase.
No macroscopic or microscopic findings of concern were noted at the injection sites.
Asparaginase preferentially inhibits antibody-precursor cells in the bone marrow and inhibits both
cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Glutamine hydrolysing activity of E. coli asparaginase
may contribute significantly towards this immunosuppression. Beside the depletion of ASN, E. coli
asparaginase reduced circulating glutamine concentrations and reduced protein synthesis in liver and
spleen but not in pancreas assuming that the nutrient stress response to asparaginase is tissue-specific
and exacerbated by glutamine depletion. The SmPC notes the potential for infections which addresses
the potential for immunosuppression; hence from a non-clinical perspective, no further action is required.
2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Overall, the non-clinical package submitted to support this application is acceptable.
2.4. Clinical aspects
2.4.1. Introduction
GCP
The applicant claimed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. A GCP inspection
was triggered on the pivotal study MC-ASP.5/ALL and MC-ASP.6/INF. The inspection uncovered several
findings. One critical finding occurred during inspection of the bioanalytical laboratory and concerned
non-adherence to the study plan criteria for accepting or rejecting calibration standards for the

asparaginase assay. Due to these findings the pivotal study MC-ASP.5/ALL was not considered to be GCP
compliant (see discussion on clinical efficacy).
Assessment report
EMA/CHMP/842555/2015
Page 32/132

No dose ranging studies were submitted by the Applicant investigating PK dose linearity. However,
published clinical trials suggest that asparaginase trough serum activities are linear over the dose range
2,500 to 10,000 U/m2. A trough serum asparaginase activity level of greater than 100 U/L is generally
considered to guarantee complete ASN depletion in serum and CSF. The majority of trough asparaginase
activity levels in the combined pivotal and PK trials after repeated administration ranged from 120 - 200
U/L. PK data regarding maintenance of asparaginase level above 100 U/L have also been provided and are
discussed under the clinical efficacy discussion (see also discussion on clinical efficacy).
A population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) two-compartment model for recombinant asparaginase was
developed. The Applicant acknowledged the limitations of performed analyses which were mainly due to
the availability of only few data from infants and to the fact that no external evaluation of the final
NONMEM-model was performed due to a lack of an external dataset. The model indicated an initial
distribution phase with a short elimination half-live of about 0.2 hours, and a second elimination phase by
first-order kinetics with a terminal elimination half-live of 17.4 hours. Variability in the clearance
estimates was relatively low, whereas inter-individual variability was significantly high (66%) for the
estimates of central volume of distribution. This was somewhat expected given the known variability in
the peak plasma values (Cmax).
The PopPK model showed a clear correlation between the clearance of recombinant asparaginase and
body surface area (BSA), thus supporting the adequacy of dosing based on BSA. Using this PopPK model,
the influence of covariates such as age, BSA, body weight, and body height on the trough asparaginase
serum activities was investigated. Neither correlation with these covariates nor significant difference
between the trough asparaginase serum activities of boys and girls was found. The model was also used
to study the influence of trough asparaginase serum activities on status of minimal residual disease
(MRD) at the end of induction treatment. Also in this case no correlation was found.
The measured serum creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
antithrombin III and fibrinogen values did not appear to be influenced substantially by the
asparaginase-activity trough levels. Thus, from this analysis, there are no safety-concerns in this
dose-schedule.
The small number of patients (n=12) receiving a dose of more than 6500 U/m2 recombinant asparaginase
had lower trough activities than patients receiving lower doses. It is notable that the patients receiving
more than 6500 U/m2 recombinant asparaginase were all infants (from the infant trial). This finding must
be interpreted with caution, because sampling times for the trough levels were not standardised to a
certain hour after administration. The model predicted a significantly (p < 0.05) higher CL and a lower V1
for the infants. The higher CL in infants is not surprising as the parameter was standardised to body
weight and infants often show a higher clearance per kg than older children. The difference in the CL
standardised to BSA was statistically significant but small and does not appear to be of clinical relevance.
Therefore, from the PK point of view, there is currently no sufficient evidence to change the proposed
dose in infants. The recommended dose in infants is 6,700 U/m2 BSA in patients aged less than 6 months
and 7,500 U/m2 BSA in patients aged 6 - 12 months based on study MC-ASP.6/INF.
The Applicant did not perform any PK studies in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. Results from
the PopPK analysis did not highlight any correlation between exposure to the two asparaginase
formulations and serum creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
antithrombin III and fibrinogen covariates.
No new PK drug interaction studies have been conducted with Spectrila. No studies on induction/inhibition
of drug-metabolising enzymes were performed. Well-established potential/identified interactions with
medicinal products that are administered concurrently in multi-drug treatment protocols for the target
indications are further discussed below and adequately reported in section 4.5 of the SmPC. This
Assessment report

approach is considered sufficient to justify the lack of new specific PK drug-interaction studies with
asparaginase.
In view of the limited PK data in adults, the applicant will undertake further study of PK, PD and safety of
Spectrila in adults post-approval (see RMP).
Pharmacodynamics
Since pharmacodynamic data using asparagine as a surrogate marker of efficacy were submitted as
pivotal evidence of efficacy, these data are presented and discussed under the section on clinical efficacy.
With regards to pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products, the toxicity of vincristine
may be additive with that of asparaginase if both agents are administered concomitantly. Therefore,
vincristine should be given 3 to 24 hours before administration of r L asparaginase in order to minimise
toxicity (see SmPC section 4.5). Within trial MC-ASP.5/ALL vincristine was given together with
asparaginase on day 15 but no allergic reactions were observed on that day (see clinical safety). Potential
interaction of vincristine and ASNase is adequately addressed in the RMP.
Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and/ or anticoagulants with asparaginase may increase the risk of a
change in coagulation parameters (see section 4.4). This can promote tendency to bleeding
(anticoagulants) or thrombosis (glucocorticoids). Caution is therefore needed when anticoagulants (e.g.
coumarin, heparin, dipyridamole, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal
products) or glucocorticoids are given at the same time (see SmPC section 4.5) ..
Interactions with glucocorticoids (altered coagulation and increased risk of osteonecrosis) are adequately
addressed in the risk management plan. Potential interactions with anticoagulants will also be closely
monitored as important potential risks.
Inhibition of protein synthesis secondary to the asparaginase-induced depletion of asparagine has been
shown to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of MTX which requires cell replication for its antineoplastic activity.
This antagonism is observed if asparaginase is administered prior to or concurrently with methotrexate.
Conversely, the antitumour effects of methotrexate are enhanced when asparaginase is administered 24
hours following methotrexate treatment. This regimen has been shown to reduce the gastrointestinal and
haematological effects of methotrexate. (see SmPC section 4.5).
Laboratory in vitro and in vivo data indicate that the efficacy of high-dose cytarabine is reduced by prior
administration of asparaginase. However, when asparaginase was given after cytarabine a synergistic
effect was observed. This effect was most prominent with a treatment interval of about 120 hours (see
SmPC section 4.5).
Schedule-dependent interactions with methotrexate and with Ara-C as well are adequately addressed in
the RMP.
Asparaginase may increase the toxicity of other medicinal products through its effect on liver function,
e.g. increased hepatotoxicity with potentially hepatotoxic medicines, increased toxicity of medicinal
products metabolised by the liver or bound to plasma proteins and altered pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of medicines bound to plasma proteins (see SmPC section 4.5). Potential interaction
with other medicines where impaired liver metabolism could increase toxicity are covered in the RMP.
2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The clinical pharmacology data are considered sufficient and have been adequately reflected in the
product information.

Similar to induction treatment, ASP levels rose during treatment with study drug due to continuous
cleavage of ASN.
With regard to evaluation of glutamine concentrations in serum during the post-induction phase, slightly
larger decreases were seen in patients administered recombinant asparaginase than patients
administered asparaginase medac in HR Blocks 1 and 2). This pattern was also repeated, with respect to
increases in glutamic acid serum concentrations.
Complete Remission Rate and Minimal Residual Disease Status after Induction Phase
The assessment of CR rate and MRD status was performed after induction treatment, i.e. Day 33 or later
if bone marrow was not evaluable on Day 33. Rates of CR and MRD status after induction were
comparable in both treatment groups. In each of the treatment groups two patients (2.0%) were not in
CR. The MRD status after induction phase was negative in 32 patients (31.7%) in the asparaginase medac
group and in 29 patients (29.6%) in the recombinant asparaginase group.

Cumulative incidence of Relapse, Relapse Free Survival and Event-Free Survival
For the evaluation of cumulative incidence of relapse, RFS and EFS patients were followed up every 12
months + 2 weeks after randomisation until disease recurrence, death or until the end of the study.
Patients who discontinued treatment according to protocol DCOG ALL 10 and patients who received
allogenic bone marrow transplantation were not followed up. The median time of follow up was 12 months
in both treatment groups.
No relapses occurred during this time in either treatment group. Relapse-free survival was defined as the
probability of being alive with no indication of relapse. Since no relapses were documented, RFS was
exclusively driven by the four deaths that occurred.
Event-free survival was defined as the time span between date of randomisation and date of death,
relapse or premature termination of DCOG ALL 10 protocol - whichever occurred first.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates for RFS and EFS in the asparaginase medac and recombinant asparaginase
groups are described below.

Main Exclusion criteria
· General health status according to Karnofsky / Lansky score < 40%
· Pre-existing coagulopathy (e.g. haemophilia)
· Patients with known genetic prothrombotic risk factors
· Pre-existing pancreatitis, kidney or liver insufficiency
· Other current malignancies
Statistical plan
The confirmative objective of this trial is to show that the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of the
population geometric means of the 72 h asparaginase serum concentration versus time curves (AUC0-72h)
for the first administration of recombinant asparaginase (test product) and Asparaginase medac
(reference product) is within the equivalence limit 0.75 to 1.33. This wider acceptance range was chosen
due to the following reasons: substantial variance of the relative bioavailability (parallel group design,
paediatric patients); wide therapeutic range of asparaginase treatment; no safety and/or efficacy
concerns; paediatric patient population (age ≥1 year up to ≤18 years).
Analysis populations
- ITT population - Patients randomised into the study who had received at least one asparaginase
infusion. This was used for the safety analysis.
- PK population - All patients who had been administered the first dose of the study medication and had
completed the study up to Day 15 according to the study protocol without serious deviations (i.e. at
least 50% missing samples per asparaginase concentration profile in the 0-72 h interval, significant
deviation from scheduled time).
- Per protocol population - All patients who had been administered the first seven doses of the study
medication and had completed the study up to Day 33 before administration of the eighth dose
without serious deviations which might have influenced the ASN concentrations in serum and CSF.
Results
Disposition of patients
Altogether 32 children with previously untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia participated in the study.
One patient discontinued due to a SAE (viral hepatitis) after 7 of 8 scheduled infusions. All other patients
completed the entire course of treatment. All enrolled patients were included in the ITT and PP
populations. However, 2 patients were excluded from the PK population.

WBC counts in peripheral blood ranged from 0.6 to 227x109 WBC/L, and one patient had an extreme
value of 578 x109 WBC/L, with up to 96% peripheral blasts.
Pharmacokinetic results
All subjects receiving test or reference treatment exhibited measurable asparaginase serum activities.
Immediately after infusion, geometric mean asparaginase serum activity was 3231.19 U/L following
recombinant asparaginase infusion and 3303.04 U/L following Asparaginase medac treatment. After 72h,
the geometric mean asparaginase serum activity was 123.18 U/L following recombinant asparaginase
infusion and 174.96 U/L following Asparaginase medac treatment. Geometric mean serum activity vs.

All patients responded to the treatment on Day 15 to 33, showing an at least 95% depletion of ASN
compared to the initial value in serum for the respective treatment day, although a small number of
samples in both treatment arms (in both serum and CSF analyses) were missing and could not be
included in the analysis.

of more than 9 days. 3 patients treated with recombinant L-asparaginase and 4 treated with Asparaginase
medac had missing samples on Day 39 so duration of the depletion could not be determined.

The exploratory comparisons did not show significant differences between the two treatments for the
responder rates of patients with respect to ASN depletion in serum (at least 95% compared to initial
value) and CSF (percentage of patients with ASN < LLoQ) for each day (Days 15 to 33).
Correlation of Asparagine in serum with asparaginase activity
The asparagine concentrations in serum correlated significantly (Spearman r = - 0.7084 for test and r =
-0.6813 for reference; p<0.0001) to asparaginase serum concentrations under both treatments, that is,
the higher the concentrations of asparaginase, the lower the asparagine concentrations.
The mixed model analysis of asparagine depletion in serum from Day 15 to Day 33 showed least square
(LS) means for the recombinant asparaginase treatment of 99.38 (UT) and of 99.40 (uR) for the
Asparaginase medac treatment. The lower limits of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the
treatment difference (uT- UR) derived from the mixed model is -0.0243 (absolute) and -0.0244
(expressed in % of the LS mean of the reference). Non-inferiority of recombinant asparaginase (Test) in
comparison to Asparaginase medac (Reference) with respect to ASN depletion in serum from Day 15 to 33
was concluded as the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the treatment difference
(uT-uR) derived from the mixed model is above the corresponding A (-0.2 uR).
ANOVA of ASN depletion in CSF was not done because nearly all values on Days 15 and 33 were below the
LLoQ.
Asparaginase treatment significantly correlated with asparagine depletion in serum under both
treatments. The non-inferiority of asparagine depletion under the recombinant asparaginase treatment
compared to Asparaginase medac treatment was shown with the upper 95% confidence limit in % of LS
means of reference exceeding A = - 20.

Induction (Study MC-ASP.6/INF)
The variability of the serum trough asparaginase levels between patients was high. Median serum trough
asparaginase levels were 208.810 U/L on Day 18, 130.160 U/L on Day 25 and 32.420 U/L on Day 33. The
trough asparaginase levels on Day 33 were considerably lower as compared to Day 18 and Day 25 which
was due to the fact that the latter levels were assessed 3 days after recombinant asparaginase infusion
while assessment on Day 33 was performed 4 days after the last recombinant asparaginase infusion.

Only 1 patient had detectable levels of asparagine in serum at Day 33. The median baseline level of ASN
was 48.155 umol/L (Min, Max 28.570, 79.710 umoL/L).
The median aspartic acid level in serum was 3.18 umol/L at baseline. On Day 18 and Day 25
measurements before recombinant asparaginase infusion resulted in increased median ASP levels of
12.89 umol/L (Min, Max 5.10, 23.21 umol/L) and 14.90 umol/L (Min, Max 4.91, 40.11 umoL/L),
respectively. On Day 33 the median ASP level had decreased to 7.58 umol/L (Min, Max 3.74, 44.19
umoL/L).
The median level of glutamine was 476.90 umol/L at baseline decreasing slightly from 397.78 umoL/L on
Day 18 to 379.40 umol/L on Day 25 and to 347.77 umol/L (Min, Max 217.29, 490.34 umoL/L) on Day
33.
The median level of glutamic acid was 94.89 umol/L at baseline and stayed steady during induction,
decreasing slightly to 74.17 umol/L on Day 33.

Leukaemic Blasts
On Day 33 all patients showed a percentage of below 5% of leukaemic blasts in BM. The median
percentage of leukaemic blasts in BM was 0.5% (Min, Max 0, 3.0%).
Relapse Rate and Event-Free Survival
The relapse rate and EFS were evaluated at the end of the follow-up which ended 5 weeks after the last
patient received the last recombinant asparaginase infusion. Four patients experienced a relapse -
cumulative incidence: 27% after 6 months (90% CI [6%, 49%]) and 42% after 12 months (90% CI
[16%, 68%]). The Kaplan Meier estimates of EFS were 73% after 6 months (90% CI [51%, 94%]) and
58% after 12 months (90% CI [32%, 84%]).
