About the product
Vazkepa contains icosapent ethyl, a derivative of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). EPA is part of approved
medicinal products containing EPA/DHA that are licenced for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.
"Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high
cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (>150 mg/dL) and:
· established cardiovascular disease, or
· diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor
For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on
cardiovascular events see Section 5.1. "
(revised wording)
It is intended for long-term therapy. The recommended daily oral dose is 4 capsules taken as two
998 mg capsules twice daily.
Type of Application and aspects on development
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant's request for an accelerated assessment as the product was
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following argumentation.
"Although treatment options are available aiming at reduction of cardiovascular risk on top of statin
therapy (PCSK9, ezetimibe) or at reduction of high triglyceride levels (fibrates, niacin, Omacor
[containing EPA.DHA]), there is still a need to further reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
patients at increased cardiovascular risk despite appropriate baseline therapy. This constitutes a major
public health interest. However, it is not obvious that Vazkepa addresses this unmet medical need.
Vazkepa contains icosapent ethyl, a derivative of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). EPA is part of approved
medicinal products containing EPA/DHA that are licenced for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.
Previous trials investigating EPA/DHA and EPA in lower doses provided conflicting results. EPA/DHA
containing drugs at lower doses lack efficacy in patients after myocardial infarction, and the results of
another study with EPA at 1800 mg daily (JELIS study) are not straightforward in demonstrating a
beneficial effect on CV outcome and all-cause mortality.
Different from previous trials, in the single pivotal trial supporting Vazkepa (REDUCE IT), the purified
active moiety eicosapentaenoic acid was ethyl esterified and used at a higher dose (4 g daily) and DHA
was not part of the product.
The association between the reduction of high TG and the CV outcomes is the matter of the discussion.
The results of previous studies targeting the TG to reduce the CV risk are conflicting. In addition, the
mode of action of EPA is not clear as the reduction of TG can explain only partly the beneficial effects
observed in the REDUCE IT study.
The top-line results of the REDUCE-IT were seen as promising. However, a thorough review of all
available data is needed as in this single pivotal trial there were some safety issues identified (e.g.
increase risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter or serious bleeding events including intracranial in the active
treatment arm) that require in depth analyses of benefit/risk balance in subgroups and with co-
medications. Also, the choice of the comparator in the pivotal trial (mineral oil) could be questioned.
These considerations together with the numerous areas of uncertainty raise doubts that this medicinal
product is of major interest from the point of view of public health, in particular from the viewpoint of

therapeutic innovation and if an accelerated time frame is appropriate given that it can be foreseen
that an assessment of benefit and risk balance may not be straightforward and requires time and
resources for the initial assessment and detailed discussions with the applicant within the procedure."

2.2.2. Active Substance
General information
The chemical name of active substance is ethyl (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-5,8,11,14,17-icosapentaenoate
corresponding to the molecular formula C22H34O2. It has a relative molecular weight of 330.50 and the
following structure:
Figure 1: Active substance structure
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of GC-MS spectrometry,
13C-NMR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, UV-visible spectrometry, and elemental
analysis.
The active substance is a liquid oil at ambient room temperature with high solubility in organic solvents
but no detectable solubility in water. The active substance has a low aqueous solubility and high
permeability, it therefore is classified as a Class 2 compound according to the Biopharmaceutical

reduction of Ica,L and intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cardiac myocytes. EPA attenuated atrial
fibrillation promotion and atrial remodelling.
EPA has anti-inflammatory properties inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism and COX-2 activity.
Mediators from major 22-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA termed resolvins (resolution-phase interaction
products) and protectins possess pro-resolving, anti-inflammatory (reducing neutrophil traffic, pro-
inflammatory cytokines and excessive proinflammatory gene expression) and antifibrotic as well as
host-directed antimicrobial actions. 2-3FA intake reduces leukotrienes, prostaglandins and other
markers of leukocyte activation (e.g. TNF-a, IL-1 and hsCRP). 2-3FAs have multiple hemodynamic
effects: reductions in resting heart rate and blood pressure, in addition to increased vasodilatation and
arterial compliance.
Obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with high levels of free fatty acids from the
breakdown of dysregulated TG (lipolysis) in adipose tissue, and TNF-a is a proinflammatory cytokine
that is increased in obesity and implicated in the development of insulin resistance. EPA inhibits pro-
inflammatory cytokine-induced lipolysis in adipocytes, and this effect might contribute to the insulin-
sensitizing properties of EPA.
Administration of 22-3 fatty acid improves neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,
Huntington's disease (HD) and schizophrenia. EPA protects against neurodegeneration by modulating
synaptic plasticity, preventing oxidative stress-triggered apoptotic cell death, reversing age-related
changes in interleukin-1B-induced apoptotic cell death, and by its capacity to increase brain
docosahexaenoic acid, leading to sustained long-term potentiation.
Safety pharmacology programme
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted.
At micromolar concentrations EPA inhibits cardiac Ica,L, INa and several cardiac K+ channels (Ito, IK and
IKur). These effects on cardiac ion channels might be responsible for the increased incidence of atrial
fibrillation observed after the administration of EPA in humans. To date no study evaluating the effect
of EPA on hERG channels has been performed or is available in the public literature. Because EPA
inhibits IK (which is composed of IKr and IKs), but has no effect on Iks, it is tempting to speculate that
EPA has inhibitory effects on IKr/hERG channels, and this hypothesis is reinforced by the observation
that the structurally similar arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid both inhibit hERG channels.
According to the requirement laid down in ICH S7B and in order to characterize the electrophysiology
of EPA, hERG channel inhibition by unbound EPA will be studied by the applicant via whole-cell patch-
clamp recordings in cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA, and the final report will be available by
the end of February 2021.
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
The Applicant mentions a study of Yanagisawa (1992) where no synergistic effects on bleeding time or
ADP-induced platelet aggregation were observed in rabbits when EPA and ticlopidine were
administered concomitantly.
Conclusion
The primary pharmacologic effects of Ethyl-EPA are on lipid and lipoprotein levels (reduction of serum
lipids and lipoproteins).
Assessment report

Page 21/129
The secondary pharmacology effects of Ethyl-EPA that have been discussed in the literature are:
· beneficial effect on thrombosis and artherosclerosis (inhibition of platelet aggregation and
thrombus formation),
· anti-inflammatory properties (formation of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids such as resolvins,
down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, down-regulation of arachidonic acid
metabolism),
· cardioprotective effects (maintenance of arterial elasticity and effect on blood flow),
· neuroprotective effects (neuro-anti-inflammatory effects, effects on central nervous system
(CNS) disorders and psychiatric disorders),
· and improvement of the metabolic profile in animal models of diabetes
2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics
Fatty acids are absorbed from the small intestine without being absorbed by the stomach; whereas
short to medium-chain fatty acids are transferred into the physiological environment via the portal
vein, long-chain fatty acids are transferred via the lymph; the formation of a mixed micelle with bile
acids is necessary for absorption of lipids.
The absorption speed and degree of absorption of 14C-EPA-E was promoted by bile, since fatty acids
form a mixed micelle immediately before absorption, and the presence of bile acids is important for the
formation of this mixed micelle. EPA has a very high extent of plasma protein binding (nearly 100 % in
dogs, 98.8 - 99.8 % in humans and 97.3 - 99.9 % in rats).
In rats unchanged Ethyl-EPA was not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and all lipid radioactivity
in lymph was attributed to de-esterified Ethyl-EPA (i.e. EPA). Dogs orally administered 14C-EPA-E
showed a distribution pattern considerably different from rats, since most of the radioactivity was in
LDL and HDL, but little in VLDL and chylomicron. Such a difference could partly be attributable to the
lower rate of gastrointestinal absorption of EPA-E in dogs and an interspecies difference of the rate of
conversion of chylomicron or VLDL to LDL could also exist: in humans 75 - 90 % of VLDL is converted
to LDL, whereas only 10 % of VLDL is metabolized to LDL in rats.
In rats after oral administration of Ethyl-EPA, the results of whole-body autoradiography demonstrated
that the tissue concentrations showed maxima after 9 - 24 hours and then slowly declined. Repeated
administrations result in the increase in the concentrations of radioactivity in the heart, liver, brain and
adipose tissues, and maximum values in brain, fat and skin are reached 1 week after administration,
and elimination from the brain was particularly slow (half-life of 8 - 40 days). Tissue concentration
after daily administrations of 14C-EPA-E over 4 to 12 days was higher than that after a single
administration with the concentration after 12 administrations rising to 3.5 - 40-fold that after a single
administration. The elimination half-life of radioactivity from tissues was 7.6 - 8.4 days, and, thus,
similar to that from plasma and from adipose tissue, suggesting that the elimination of Ethyl-EPA and
its metabolites follows the metabolic cycle of fat.
After absorption, long-chain fatty acids are incorporated in the triglycerides in the epithelial cells of the
small intestine, then are bound to apo-proteins, secreted by chylomicrons or VLDL to lymph, before
being transferred into the blood and then into the tissues.

2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics
Absorption
Vazkepa (icosapent ethyl or ethyl-EPA) is the ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). After dosing humans with clinical doses
of Vazkepa, only very low levels of ethyl-EPA are sporadically detected in plasma. Therefore, the major chemical moiety in the systemic circulation after
Vazkepa administration is the active metabolite EPA, and appropriate assays were developed to measure EPA in plasma for the evaluation of
pharmacokinetics (PK).
After oral administration of ethyl-EPA (icosapent ethyl), the parent drug is completely or nearly completely de-esterified during the absorption process
and the active metabolite EPA is absorbed into the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct lymphatic system.
EPA is incorporated into circulating phospholipids (PL), triacylglycerols (TAG) or triglycerides and cholesteryl esters (CE). Only a small fraction of the total
circulating EPA concentration is unesterified, i.e., free or protein bound, and not incorporated in these lipids. Therefore, the major assay for PK
evaluations measured total EPA: the total EPA concentration in plasma includes unesterified EPA and EPA incorporated in PL, TAG, and CE.
EPA is also incorporated in the phospholipids of cell membranes wherein EPA provides structural properties to the membrane (for example fluidity in red
blood cell membranes), but more importantly, is a source for intracellular activities related to its triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects.
Because of the ease of sample collection, omega-3 fatty acids are often measured in red blood cells (RBC) as a marker for tissue exposure. Therefore,
the appropriate assays were also developed to measure EPA in RBC after Vazkepa administration. In RBC, almost all EPA is incorporated in phospholipids
of the cell membrane.
Analytical methods
A Gas Chromatography Plus Flame Ionization Detector assay was used to quantify 28 fatty acids (the fatty acid profile), including EPA, in RBC and plasma
samples. For each fatty acid, the total concentrations are measured, which include unesterified fatty acids and fatty acids incorporated (esterified) in
TAG, PL and CE.
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring total EPA in human plasma and RBC.
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring total EPA in human serum.
Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) assay method was used for measuring unesterified EPA in human plasma. This assay
was also used in Amarin-sponsored nonclinical toxicology studies in mouse, rat, and dog.

Weight and BMI
In both MARINE and ANCHOR, body weight appeared to have a small and inconsistent effect on the EPA concentration in plasma or RBC. However, in the
different subgroups defined by BMI tertiles in ANCHOR after 4 g/day Vazkepa differences are visible. In RBC EPA increase (mean (SE)) in the first tertile
(BMI < 30 kg/m2) was 83.6 (3.90) ug/mL (n = 22) but just 39.3 (3.86) in the third tertile (>35 kg/m2; n = 24). In plasma similar data were found
(187.7 (12.95) vs. 121.4 (9.21)). However, the serum levels of EPA reached on-treatment with Vazkepa at all time-points were substantial for all
subgroups, with no obvious differences observed in efficacy and safety across the various BMI subgroups.
Elderly
A clinical study in age-associated memory impaired patients aged 50 to 70 years shows agreement with the PK data from healthy volunteers and from
patients with other CNS disorders, demonstrating that, in general, the PK of EPA after Vazkepa administration was similar in older subjects (50-70 years)
as compared to younger subjects.

With Vazkepa 4 g / day a higher concentration of plasma total EPA in patients with an age of 65 or older was observed (Plasma EPA Concentration,
REDUCE-IT, Change from Baseline to year 1 (ug/mL Median (IQR)) <65 years 111.3 (108.4); 65 -< 75 years 124.5 (113.8); >75 years 127.6 (125.5)).
The finding was not considered clinically relevant with respect to efficacy. Concerning safety it is noted that a higher rate of bleedings and hemorrhagic
strokes was observed in the >75 year age group for Vazkepa vs. Placebo but not in patients < 65 years. Whether the about 15% higher mean exposure
in patients >75 year age contributed to this finding may not be clarified based on the data available.
Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021
Page 41/129
Serum EPA levels appear generally similar across the age subgroups, with any mean or median differences between subgroups being modest, particularly
in comparison to observed IQRs.
The serum levels of EPA reached on-treatment with Vazkepa at all time-points were substantial for all subgroups. Available EPA PK data do not provide
evidence to infer a substantial difference in efficacy or safety across subgroups of age.
Children
A product-specific waiver was granted.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
The general interaction potential of an essential fatty acid of the omega-3 series is considered small. Due to the diversity of metabolic pathways and
widely distributed storage in the body, relevant effects of other drugs on EPA-PK are unlikely.
In vitro studies show that EPA is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent of CYP2B6 and CYP3A. This was addressed by
interaction studies with omeprazole (to address CYP2C19), rosiglitazone (to address CYP2C8), warfarin (to address CYP2C9) and atorvastatin (to address
CYP3A4). Other CYP-enzymes are involved in metabolism of the drugs as well e.g. CYP2C9 (rosiglitazone), CYP1A2, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (warfarin).
Though not all results exclude any interaction, the observed deviations are small and e.g. for omeprazole and rosiglitazone not in accordance with the
assumption of an increased exposure due to CYP inhibition.
In subgroup analyses from MARINE and ANCHOR studies, no consistent effect of antihypertensive drugs, antiplatelet drugs and statins (atorvastatin,
rosuvastatin and simvastatin) on EPA-concentrations was detected.
Thus, based on the submitted data, absence of specific clinically relevant drug-drug-interactions can be assumed.

TG-qualifying values was >2.09 mmol/L (185 mg/dL) with ≥1 of the 2 values >2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL);
and the upper limit of the LDL-C entry criteria was increased by 15% to 2.97 mmol/L (≤115 mg/dL)

Baseline data
Patient demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 11-1, overall and by
treatment group. Overall, the majority of patients were male (71.2% [5822/8179]) and white (90.2%
[7379/8179]). The mean age of patients was 63.4 years (range 44 to 92 years), with 46.0%
(3763/8179) of patients aged ≥65 years. Mean height, weight, and BMI were 171.3 cm, 93.0 kg, and
31.6 kg/m2, respectively. Overall, 22.2% (1816/8179) of patients were renally impaired at baseline
(eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2). The demographics and baseline characteristics across the ITT, mITT, and
PP populations were comparable.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial (REDUCE-IT). No analyses were provided across
trials. This is appropriate.
Supportive studies
Two supportive studies were provided. Both studies aimed at investigating the effect of AMR101 at 2
doses (2gr daily and 4 gr daily, administered BID with wood in comparison with a placebo containing
mineral oil) on lipid parameters and other parameters relevant for the characterisation of CV risk of
patients.
AMR101 MARINE Study (AMR-01-01-0016) NCT01047683
A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, 12-Week Study
With an Open-Label Extension to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of AMR101 in Patients
With Fasting Triglyceride Levels >500 mg/dl and <2000 mg/dl:
It was a multi-center, international, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 3 arm, double
blind study. The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of AMR101 2 g daily and
4 g daily, compared to placebo, in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with fasting TG levels >500
mg/dl and ≤2000 mg/dl (≥5.6 mmol/L and ≤22.6 mmol/L). It included a
- 6- to 8-week screening/washout period (which included a diet and lifestyle stabilization period and a
TG qualifying period),
- a 12-week double-blind treatment period (AMR101 2 g daily, AMR101 4 g daily, or placebo) and a
- 40-week open-label extension (OLE) period. All patients were to receive open-label AMR101 4 g daily.
From Visit 7 (Week 12) until the end of the study, changes to the lipid-altering regimen were permitted
(e.g., initiating, restarting, or raising the dose of statin or adding/restarting non-statin, lipid-altering
medications), as guided by standard practice and prescribing information. After Visit 8 (Week 16),
patients were to return to the site every 12 weeks until the last visit at Visit 11 (Week 52).
For methods and results of the OLE see below. The study design is depicted in Figure 1. Of the 229
patients assigned randomly to treatment, 76 were assigned to the placebo group, 76 were assigned to
the AMR101 2 g group, and 77 were assigned to the AMR101 4 g group. Fourteen (6.1%) patients
discontinued from the double-blind treatment period: 7 (3.1%) patients withdrew consent, 4 (1.7%)
patients due to an adverse event, 2 (0.9%) patients with TG >2000 mg/dl, and 1 (0.4%) patient was
lost to follow-up.

Vazkepa is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adult statin-treated patients at high
cardiovascular risk with elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) and:
· established cardiovascular disease, or
· diabetes, and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor
For study details including cardiovascular risk factors and results with respect to effects on
cardiovascular events see Section 5.1.
Dose finding studies
Dose selection was based on the efficacy of Vazkepa in reducing TG levels as investigated in two
supportive controlled studies, ANCHOR and MARINE. Both were 3 arm, randomised, double-blind,
placebo controlled, multi-centre studies with a 12-week double-blind period. MARINE was followed by a
40-week open label extension study. TG reduction was the primary endpoint in both studies, additional
lipid parameters and serum markers were investigated as additional endpoints. In MARINE study,
patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia (TG ≥5.6 and ≤22.6 mmol/L [>500 and ≤2000 mg/dL]) while
in ANCHOR study patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (TG ≥2.3 and <5.6 mmol/L [>200 and <500
mg/dL]) on statin therapy were included. In both studies 2 or 4 g/day Vazkepa or matching placebo
(mineral oil) taken bid with food was administered. The studies included an evaluation of the
correlation between EPA in plasma and red blood cells and the TG lowering effect at the two doses
selected.
Main study REDUCE-IT
The application is mainly based on one pivotal trial the REDUCE IT trial. It was a Phase 3 randomised,
placebo controlled event (cardiovascular events) driven study in patients with moderately elevated TG
(≥1.5 and <5.6 mmol/L [>135 and <500 mg/dL], after amendment 1: >2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and
<500 mg/dL) on statin therapy and at high risk for CVD. Patients received 2 g of AMR101 twice daily
(BID) (4 g/day) or matching placebo (mineral oil).
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of AMR101 compared to
placebo in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events (5 fold MACE: Composite of CV death, non-
fatal MI (including silent MI), non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularisation, or unstable angina requiring
emergent hospitalisation). The key secondary efficacy endpoint was time to 3-fold MACE (CV death,
non-fatal MI (including silent MI), or non-fatal stroke) which is considered more relevant for the
assessment of efficacy. Additional secondary CV endpoints were analysed in a predefined hierarchical
order. Patients were included in two separate groups based on CV risk at baseline (intended ratio
70/30% Group 1/Group 2). CV Risk Category 1 (Secondary Prevention Cohort): men and women ≥45
years with documented coronary artery diseases (CAD), cerebrovascular or carotid disease, or
peripheral arterial disease (PAD). CV risk category 2 (Primary Prevention Cohort): Men and women >
50 years of age with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or Type 2) and additional predefined risk factors
(smoker, higher age, hypertension, renal dysfunction, retinopathy, micro- or macroalbuminuria, or
Ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9 without symptoms). Randomization was stratified by CV risk category,
use of ezetimibe (yes/no), and by geographical region (Westernized, Eastern European, and Asia
Pacific). Two protocol amendments were included after start of the study. The most relevant was the
introduction of patients with higher level of TG as an inclusion criterion.
Numbers planned and analysed: A total of approximately 7990 patients were planned to be enrolled
(i.e., randomized) in the study to either receive AMR101 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 3995
Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021
Page 91/129
patients per treatment group) to observe an estimated 1612 primary endpoint events. A total of 473
sites enrolled and/or followed patients in 11 countries in 3 geographic regions. A total of 19,212
patients were screened, 8179 patients were randomized/ 7314 completed the final visit (Vazkepa
4089/3684, Placebo 4090/3630). All efficacy analyses, including the primary analysis, were performed
on the ITT population.
The statistical methods are generally acceptable.
The study was planned and started before the concept of estimand was introduced by the ICH E9 (R1)
addendum on estimands and sensitivity analysis in clinical trials. Nevertheless, although not explicitly
specified using estimand terminology, including data after discontinuation of study drug for patients
who discontinued study drug prematurely implies that a 'treatment policy' strategy was applied for the
intercurrent event treatment discontinuation, which is appropriate. Censoring patients for non-CV
death can either be seen as corresponding to targeting the hypothetical treatment effect that would
have been observed if no non-CV deaths had occurred (under a missing at random assumption), or to
targeting the effect while not having died for non-CV reasons. Both approaches have limitations
regarding relevance and interpretability. Therefore, the secondary endpoint including total mortality in
the composite endpoint instead of CV-death is of particular relevance.
The stratified log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model are standard methods for analysis
of time to event data, also taking the stratified randomisation adequately into account. However,
interpretation of the hazard ratio (HR) estimate resulting from the Cox model is not straightforward if
the proportional hazards assumption is not fulfilled.
The measures to ensure confidentiality of interim analyses results to preserve the integrity of the study
were adequate. The 95% confidence intervals that were calculated for the primary (and secondary)
endpoints are nominal confidence intervals that are not consistent with the group sequential design of
the study.
Sequential testing with alpha level 0.0437 does not necessarily ensure control of the family-wise type
1 error for secondary endpoints: The alpha level 0.0437 for final analysis was determined based on the
information fractions (proportion of events) for the primary endpoint at the interim analyses, which are
not the same as for the secondary endpoints. However, taking the actual results (p-values) into
account, this is not considered an issue.
The sensitivity analyses cover adequately the assessment of analysis assumptions, as well as some
sensitivity analyses target additional treatment effects of interest (estimands).
Overall the study was well conducted as planned, no concerns regarding compliance with GCP were
detected during the assessment.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
In the REDUCE-IT study a daily dose of AMR101 of 4 g (2 g BID with food) was investigated. No data
are available on the correlation between dose and efficacy on hard CV clinical endpoints.
The dose selection was mainly based on results from ANCHOR and MARINE/MARINE OLE. Prior to
MARINE and ANCHOR, more than 1000 patients had been exposed to AMR101 at doses up to 4 g per
day in the randomised, double-blind periods of Amarin-sponsored studies. ANCHOR and MARINE
studies investigated efficacy of two dose levels (1 and 2 g BID, i.e. 2g and 4 g daily dose taken with
food). MARINE OLE was an open label extension study investigating a daily dose of AMR101 4 g over
40 weeks. In these studies AMR 101 resulted in statistically significant reductions of TG compared with
placebo. A larger reduction in TG and other lipid, lipoprotein, and inflammatory markers was seen with

was more frequent among the plc patients. It should be noted that the plc treatment, mineral oil, can
act as laxative; this may explain the higher rate of constipation in the Vazkepa group.

Salient numerical imbalances among less frequent AEs in the REDUCE-IT trial are compiled in the
following two tables (taken from Table 14.3.1.2.7 of CSR); the upper table shows events which were
more frequent with Vazkepa and the lower shows AEs which were more frequent in the plc group.
Beside supraventricular arrhythmias, Vazkepa increased the frequency of events of cardiac conduction
disorders, hyperuricemia/gout, skin-related AEs and allergic conditions. The latter difference was
mainly driven by the term "Hypersensitivity"; no further information is available.
In the plc group, a salient numerical increase in events of hyperglycaemia was observed. Furthermore,
electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia), ventricular arrhythmias, anaemia,
hypothyroidism and intestine polyp were more frequent with plc than with Vazkepa.

Safety information from published studies
In the Japan Eicosapentaenoic Acid Lipid Intervention Study (JELIS), a large randomised trial, revealed
a higher incidence of adverse events (AEs); skin and gastrointestinal disorders, and haemorrhage
(cerebral; fundal; epistaxis; subcutaneous) in the icosapent ethyl group than in the control group

2016, FDA had determined that "no action is necessary at this time based on available information".
Amarin continues to monitor all hepatic reports as events of special interest as part of the safety
surveillance.
Over the first 7 years of post-approval safety surveillance (26 July 2012 to 25 July 2019), there were a
total of 1204 unique reports of which 48 were serious reports. There has been one post marketing
safety report resulting from the marketing of Vazkepa outside US, in Lebanon during this period. This
report described elevation of triglycerides following initiation of therapy with Vazkepa.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions include arthralgia, product taste abnormal, blood
triglycerides increased, diarrhoea, nausea and eructation. No action has been taken for safety reasons
during this period.
Reports on serious events
During the period 26 July 2012 to 25 July 2019, there was a total of 48 expedited (15-day Alert)
reports (i.e., serious and unlabelled) reporting 69 events. There were four reports with a fatal outcome
during this period. Briefly, one report of death by suicide; one report of an accidental death by fire and
two reports of death of unknown cause while taking Vazkepa were received. There were three serious
adverse events assessed by the reporter as possibly related to Vazkepa and the events included
coronary artery occlusion, neonatal respiratory distress disorder and elevated liver enzymes. Of these
only the events of neonatal distress syndrome and elevated liver enzymes were also assessed by the
applicant as possibly related. There were an additional 13 serious adverse events evaluated by the
applicant to be possibly related to Vazkepa. These included two reports of choking/choking sensation,
two reports of epistaxis and one report each of atrial fibrillation, diarrhoea, dyspnoea, hypersensitivity,
loss of consciousness, nausea, presyncope, prostate cancer, and syncope.
Reports on non-serious events
The most common SOC was Gastrointestinal Disorders and the most frequently reported events
included diarrhoea, nausea, eructation, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal discomfort,
dyspepsia, dysphagia, abdominal distention, retching, flatulence, and vomiting. Among the Cardiac
Disorders SOC, the most frequently reported terms were palpitations and atrial fibrillation.
Further findings from Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports (PADERs)
Upon a review of the provided PADERs, 19 cases reporting bleeding events were identified, out of
which 7 were reported in the last PADER (from 26-Jul-2018 to 25-Jul 2019). In 9 from the 19 cases
the respective bleeding event was assessed by the company to be possibly causally associated with
Vazkepa and to be non-serious. Furthermore, several reports of events related to hepatic disorders
were identified. A total 6 post-marketing cases of atrial fibrillation were identified by the Assessor. In
all 6 cases a reasonable time relationship between the use of Vazkepa and the occurrence of atrial
fibrillation is recognizable. Two of the 6 cases were reported as serious cases.
2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety
Safety assessment of Vazkepa is mainly based on the results of the large phase 3 trial REDUCE-IT.
In general, Vazkepa was well tolerated. The incidence of any adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs
was equally distributed between the treatment groups in REDUCE-IT. AEs leading to withdrawal of
study drug were rather infrequent (in around 8% of patients) and numerically slightly higher in the plc
group. In the pooled phase 2 trial ANCHOR and MARINE, AEs and SAEs were numerically less frequent
in the Vazkepa than in the plc group.
Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021
Page 111/129
A numerical increase in the incidence of specific, frequent AEs in the Vazkepa compared to the plc
group was observed for the MedDRA terms musculoskeletal pain, constipation, peripheral oedema and
atrial fibrillation (AF). Regarding constipation, it should be noted that the plc substance, mineral oil, is
known to act as a laxative so that Vazkepa most likely does not increase constipation but plc decreases
it. Vice versa, anaemia was more frequently observed in the plc than in the Vazkepa group.
A more detailed analysis of AF events revealed that the increase in incidence with Vazkepa
predominantly occurred in patients with a history of AF. For these patients, a regular ECG monitoring
was recommended in the SmPC to allow early diagnosis which may increase the chance of successful
treatment of AF.
Diarrhoea was rather frequent in both treatment groups, affecting around 10% of patients. For the
plc (mineral oil) group this is expected but the question remains whether Vazkepa also can induce
diarrhoea. If so, the mechanism would be unclear. Mineral oil is thought to act as laxative because it is
not absorbed in the gut, but the latter should not be the case for EPA. On the other hand, it is not clear
whether Vazkepa or mineral oil (in the amount used as plc) caused diarrhoea at all; due to the rather
long duration of the REDUCE-IT study, it cannot be excluded that diarrhoea of other causes occurred at
least once in 10% of the participants. It is stated in the AE table in section 4.8 of the SmPC that
constipation as adverse reaction of Vazkepa was recorded with frequency common. It is also
mentioned (from post-marketing data) that Vazkepa is associated with diarrhoea. It is clarified in
section 4.8 that the relative incidence of constipation in this study may have been confounded by a
residual laxative effect for placebo, which comprised a subtherapeutic dose of light mineral oil (4 mL).
Among the less frequent AEs, there was a numerical increase in the Vazkepa compared to the plc
group in respect to hyperuricemia and gout, cardiac conduction disorders such as bundle branch
block, dermatitis, eczema and rash as well as for allergic conditions (mainly hypersensitivity). The
latter could be related to EPA's effects on inflammation via metabolism via COX and LOX to
prostaglandin and leukotriene derivates. The reason for the cardiac effects (atrial fibrillation,
conduction disorders) is not known. A potential mechanism could be related to the fact that EPA can
inhibit several cardiac ion channels in micromolar concentrations (see non-clinical part); however, it is
not clear whether the circulating EPA concentrations are sufficient for relevant channel inhibition
because EPA is highly bound to plasma proteins.
Regarding hyperuricemia and gout, a recommendation for regular determination of serum urate level
during Vazkepa treatment is not considered necessary because AEs of gout were predominantly
reported in patients with pre-existing gout. Thus, Vazkepa may increase the number of gout attacks,
but in subjects with known gout the disease is regularly monitored anyway.
Increased incidence in the plc compared to the Vazkepa group of REDUCE-IT was observed for
hyperglycaemia (58.5% of study participants had diabetes mellitus), for electrolyte disturbances
(hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) and for AEs of ventricular arrhythmias. Further evaluation of
hyperglycaemia events and glycaemic control in study participants with known diabetes did not reveal
any relevant effects of Vazkepa on HbA1c level, fasting blood glucose and hypoglycaemia rate.
Bleeding events were regarded as AEs of special interest since prior experience with @3 fatty acids
containing oil. Bleeding-related AEs were slightly more frequent with Vazkepa than with plc in REDUCE-
IT. This was also true for serious bleeding events and CNS bleeding (including subdural haematoma),
but the number of these events was low. Increased bleeding risk could be associated with lower risk of
thrombosis which in turn may contribute to the beneficial CV outcome as it is observed e.g. for ASA.
The difference in bleeding rate between Vazkepa and plc was rather small. This is also true for patients
taking antiplatelet drugs because this was the case for nearly 80% of participants in the REDUCE-IT
study. The applicant conducted further analyses. It turned out that the bleeding risk is particularly

Other secondary endpoints
Statistically significant reductions in time to event (first event, ITT) were observed for the following
secondary endpoints (predefined hierarchical testing):
CV death or nonfatal MI; fatal of nonfatal MI; urgent or emergent revascularisation; CV death;
hospitalization for unstable angina; fatal or nonfatal stroke; total mortality, nonfatal MI or nonfatal
stroke (AMR101 vs. placebo, events (%), HR (95% CI), p value): 549 (13.4%) vs. 690 (16.9%), HR
0.772 (0.690, 0.864, p <. 0001). For total mortality the numerical difference between the two groups
did not reach statistical significance: 274 (6.7%) vs. 310 (7.6%), HR 0.870 (0.739, 1.023. p = 0.0915.
Overall, the results for the primary endpoint were consistent for most of the predefined subgroups.
Geographical region, ezetimibe use, sex, hsCRP, eGFR, LDL-C, HDL-C, Apo-B, Non-HDL-C and TG at
baseline had no significant impact on efficacy as determined by the primary endpoint. A significant p
value for interaction was observed for age < 65 and > 65 years with lower efficacy at the higher age
group. Although not significant (p value for interaction 0.1388), overall efficacy tended to be lower in
the primary prevention cohort:
· Primary prevention: 146/1197 (12.2%) vs. 163/1197 (13.6%), HR 0.876 (0.700, 1.095)
· Secondary Prevention: 559/2892 (19.3%) vs. 738/2893 (25.5%), HR 0.726 (0.650, 0.810)
Results for additional tertiary composite CV composites combining CV death and other CV events and
of several additional tertiary endpoints were consistent with the results for the primary and key
secondary analysis.
3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
There are three main areas of uncertainty identified: (1) the choice of the comparator might have
biased the results in favour of Vazkepa, (2) the mechanism of action is to some degree unclear and (3)
there were uncertainties regarding the external validity of the study.
(1) Mineral oil as a comparator
Mineral oil (paraffin oil) was chosen as placebo, but it is not clear that mineral oil in fact is entirely
inert. Some of the markers relevant for prognosis showed a trend toward deterioration in the mineral
oil arm. Small numerical increases were observed for TG, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, apoB, and hsCRP.
Change from baseline in systolic BP showed a small difference between the groups. Whether these
observations just represented a natural course, were due to variability and regression to the mean
effects, or represented a negative effect of mineral oil is not clear. Based on published literature, an
increase in LDL-C by 7 - 9.3 mg/dl might translate into an increase in MACE events by about 4 - 5%,
an increase in Apo B by 6.0 mg/dL, into an increase in CAD by about 5%, and in major cardiovascular
disease risk by 4%, an increase in hsCRP by 0.5 mg into an increase by 4 - 5% in ischemic stroke and
Assessment report
EMA/145271/2021
Page 121/129
coronary artery disease and an increase by 11% in vascular deaths. A difference in systolic blood
pressure by 0.6 - 1.5 mmHg may translate into a difference in CV event rates by about 2%. Taking
into consideration that such effects cannot be independently summed up, in a worst-case scenario
attributing all of these effects to mineral oil, a putative negative impact of mineral oil on MACE should
be below 10%. However, this is still an overestimation. Regression to the mean effects and the natural
course of the disease may considerably have contributed to the increase in LDL-C and apoB.
Furthermore, the scenario does not consider that the increase in HDL-C could be beneficial. Analyses
taking physicochemical properties of drugs, efficacy and bleeding patterns into account did not indicate
a major impact of mineral oil on absorption of statins, antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants. However,
e.g. the analyses of bleeding patterns were hampered by the fact that Vazkepa itself increases the risk
of bleeding. Based on analyses as provided by the applicant, a putative negative effect of mineral oil
should not account for more than 0.3 - 3% of MACE events. In summary, it is concluded that even
when assuming the unlikely worst-case scenario, the remaining beneficial effect of Vazkepa on MACE
events can be considered robust and meaningful.
(2) The mechanism of action was not clear
A dose dependent pronounced TG lowering effect has been demonstrated. However, TG lowering
therapy has not consistently been shown to result in a CV benefit with other medicinal products.
Numerous proposed mechanisms of action have been discussed in the public domain, including effects
on platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory actions, improvement in endothelial and vascular and
plaque stabilizing effects. Some of these effects were described to be pronounced in the presence of
statins. All patients in the study were on baseline statin therapy, however, subgroup analyses indicated
that efficacy of Vazkepa possibly is lower in patients on low dose statin therapy. This does not
necessarily indicate a positive interaction of Vazkepa with statins but rather may be related to the
overall lower CV risk in patients receiving only low dose statins. Some of acute mechanisms of action
as described in the literature do not necessarily fit with the observation in REDUCE-IT of a lag time of
about 1.5 years before efficacy is observed. The applicant has provided post hoc analyses from the
REDUCE IT trial indicating a correlation between efficacy on MACE and EPA levels. However, these data
are not conclusive due to sparse sampling and the post hoc nature of the analysis with a large impact
of imputation rules on the final results.
(3) External validity of the study
Recently EMA (EMEA/H/A-31/1464) has concluded that omega-3 acid ethyl esters - containing
medicinal products for oral use are not effective in the secondary prevention after myocardial
infarction. This conclusion was based on an analysis of all available data including the GISSI P study
(1999), the OMEGA trial, Rauch et al 2008 and meta-analyses. Relevant differences to the data
provided within this application are the lower dose used in these studies (1 g daily vs. 4 g Vazkepa)
and the composition.
It has been demonstrated within this application that effects on TGs and on some other lipid
parameters are dose dependent and considerably more pronounced at the 4 g daily dose as compared
to the 2 g daily dose.
Vazkepa contains EPA only, whereas the medicinal products analysed by EMA within EMEA/H/A-
31/1464 contained a mixture of EPA and DHA. Different membrane locations and lipid interactions of
EPA and DHA may contribute to differences in biological activity (e.g. Sherratt SCR and Mason P
Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 2018; 212: 73 - 79).
Wei MY and Jacobson TA (2011 Curr Atheroscler Rep; 13: 474-83) described based on a meta-
analytical analysis that both EPA and DHA reduce TG (DHA> than EPA). DHA raised LDL-C and HDL-C
whereas EPA non-significantly reduced LDL and had no effect on HDL. The authors speculated that the
