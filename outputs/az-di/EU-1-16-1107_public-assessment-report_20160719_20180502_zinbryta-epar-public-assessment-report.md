well-established safety and efficacy profiles, many subjects continue to experience significant MS disease
activity while on treatment. Furthermore, these therapies are associated with known side effects, such as
flu-like symptoms for the IFN-ß therapies, and lipoatrophy and other injection site pathologies for GA,
which can be a significant burden for some patients. Available data suggest that approximately 40% of
MS patients may not adhere to prescribed injectable therapies for MS out of fear of, or the inconvenience
associated with, such frequent injections.
Dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide are oral DMTs that are approved for the treatment of
RRMS. While these therapies offer an improved route of administration for some patients, they
nonetheless require daily administration and furthermore some patients may not tolerate them or
continue to experience disease activity while on treatment. Oral therapies have also been associated with
clinically important side effects, such as lymphopenia for dimethyl fumarate; bradycardia, atrioventricular
block, and macular oedema for fingolimod; and hepatotoxicity and lymphopenia for teriflunomide. These
risks may necessitate exclusion of vulnerable patients and require specialized monitoring both during and
prior to initiation of therapy.
Other available DMTs include natalizumab, which, although highly effective, is associated with the risk of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Therefore, in some regions, natalizumab is authorized
as a second-line therapy in patients with highly active disease and as a first line therapy in patients with
rapidly evolving severe disease.
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that has shown superior efficacy to IFN ß-1a but that entails risks
of life-threatening autoimmune disorders, including fatal thrombocytopenia and nephropathies;
additionally, autoimmune thyroid disease is common during treatment. For these reasons, in some
regions its use is restricted to those patients who have failed other therapies or is not approved for
patients with inactive disease.
Mitoxantrone is another therapy that is also associated with significant risks, including cardiotoxicity,
which increases with cumulative dose; therefore, mitoxantrone is mainly used as a third-line therapy in
patients with severe MS who have already failed other therapies. In summary, while several DMTs are
currently available, MS patients face difficult trade-offs between benefits and risks when selecting a
therapy. These risks include inadequate disease control, life-threatening adverse events (AEs), need for
frequent injections or daily oral therapy, and/or tolerability problems that reduce treatment adherence
and quality of life. Given the heterogeneity of MS and of patients' response to therapy, disease control is
frequently incomplete after initiation of treatment, and patients must often switch from one treatment to
another as their disease progresses, or their response to a given treatment proves to be unsatisfactory
based on safety, efficacy, or tolerability.
ayer ale
Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for new, alternative high-efficacy treatment options that
have demonstrated superior efficacy to current standards of MS care, that offer advantages in terms of
frequency of administration, and that have manageable risks. Daclizumab, the active substance in
Zinbryta, was developed to address this unmet need.

2.2. Quality aspects
2.2.1. Introduction
Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to CD25, the alpha subunit of the
human high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), and modulates IL-2 signalling.
The final product, Zinbryta, is presented in a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled pen with a nominal amount of
150 mg per dose for subcutaneous administration.
2.2.2. Active Substance
General information
apprised
The active substance is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody expressed in a NSO cell line,
purified to a high degree of purity. Daclizumab binds to the alpha subunit (CD25) of the human
high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, which is expressed on the surface of activated lymphocytes.
The isotype of daclizumab is IgG1K.
Daclizumab is glycosylated at amino acid 296 of both heavy chain subunits with the major oligosaccharide
form existing as a core fucosylated biantennary structure. The N-terminus of the daclizumab heavy chain
exists as three major forms of charge variants. The C-terminus of the heavy chain exists with and without
the C-terminal lysine residue. The major form lacks the C-terminal lysine residue, resulting in a
C-terminal glycine.
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Daclizumab is expressed in NSO cells (a mouse myeloma cell line) using recombinant DNA technology.
The cell culture process is conventional, expanding the culture via shake flasks and progressively larger
bioreactors to inoculate a production bioreactor. The purification steps include harvest, several
chromatography and viral inactivation/filtration steps, and ultra/diafiltration, before dispensing into
containers for storage at 2-8℃.
Manufacturing flow charts identifying the various controlled parameters and in-process controls/tests for
each step were presented.
A comprehensive batch numbering system identifies the stage of manufacture, the year and the
consecutive numbering of batches of that active substance for the year.
Cell banking system, characterisation, and testing
Daclizumab is produced by expression in NSO cells that have been stably transfected with a single
expression vector, expressing both the daclizumab humanized light and heavy chain genes encoding the
region that binds to the alpha subunit (CD25) of the IL-2 receptor.
A two-tiered cell banking system using master cell banks (MCB) and working cell banks (WCB) is in place.
The source, history and production of the NS0 cells, MCB and WCB have been described and documented
in detail, including methods and reagents used during culture, in-vitro cell age studies, and storage
conditions according to ICHQ5B. Both MCB and WCB have been qualified and characterised by extensive
testing for mycoplasma, sterility and adventitious viruses to establish purity.

program is considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability studies support the
proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC.
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and satisfactory
documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the active substance as well as the finished
product can be reproducibly manufactured. No major objections have been identified in the initial
assessment. The deficiencies and points for clarification were appropriately addressed by the Applicant
during the review process.
2.2.6. Recommendations for future quality development
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the
CHMP recommended an additional point for further investigation.

2.3. Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1. Introduction
Daclizumab targets the alpha subunit (CD25) of the high-affinity receptor for IL-2. By inhibiting IL-2
signalling, it is proposed to reduce T cell proliferation and activation which leads to a reduction in
pro-inflammatory autoimmune directed T cell activity in patients with multiple sclerosis. The dataset
presented addressed only in vitro pharmacology of daclizumab (Zinbryta).
The product is presented at 150 mg/ml as a solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe or pen for
subcutaneous injection in packs containing 1 or 3 syringes or pens. The proposed dose is one
subcutaneous injection of 150 mg per month.
2.3.2. Pharmacology
The nonclinical program evaluated test article representative of the drug product (DP) used in clinical
development, and DP intended for commercial supply as required.
The pharmacodynamics of daclizumab is well characterized. Daclizuman is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal
antibody that binds specifically to CD25, the alpha subunit of the high-affinity interleukin 2(IL-2)
receptor. Daclizumab modulates IL-2 signalling, blocking CD25-dependent, high-affinity IL-2 receptor
signalling but leaving intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor signalling intact. Modulation of IL-2 signalling via
antagonism of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor results in distinct immunologic changes that target both
activated T cells and ectopic lymphoid aggregates. These effects are hypothesized to reduce both the
grey and white matter pathology that underlie the key clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis (MS)
and represent a therapeutic approach for the treatment of MS.
Considering the specific binding of daclizumab to CD25, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies were
performed by the Applicant, which was considered acceptable.
Additionally, as there would be limited value in the qualitative and quantitative projection of clinical
interactions between therapeutic proteins and drug metabolizing enzymes from in vitro or in vivo
nonclinical drug interaction studies, nonclinical drug interaction studies were not conducted, which was
also considered acceptable.

Safety pharmacology of daclizumab was performed in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), by
subcutaneous administration. Overall studies showed a good safety profile.
2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic (PK)/toxicokinetic (TK) profiles of daclizumab were comprehensively evaluated in single
dose intravenous IV and single and repeat-dose SC studies (acute, sub-chronic, chronic, reproductive,
embryo-foetal, and pre- and post-natal toxicology studies) in cynomolgus monkeys. Daclizuman
demonstrated very consistent and linear PK profiles in the 5 to 200 mg dose ranges tested in cynomolgus
monkeys over multiple studies, showing predictable PK/TK characteristics of monoclonal antibodies. The
overall low incidence of immunogenicity allowed for exclusion of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) positive
animals, where the observed decrease of serum daclizumab concentration due to ADA was substantial
(>20% of group average), and did not compromise the TK or the toxicological evaluations in any of the
studies.
The PK profile of daclizumab, observed after single IV administration, is consistent with that known of
mAbs, with a long half-life (t1/2) of (approximately average ~ 10 days), low systemic clearance (0.167
mL/hr/kg), and a small volume of distribution (54 mL/kg). SC administration of daclizumab, following
single and multiple doses, demonstrated slow absorption (time to attain Cmax ~2-3 days), with an
approximate dose proportional increase in exposures. Overall, it demonstrated dose proportional linear
PK/TK, with no gender difference in any of the PK/TK parameters and moderate accumulation (~2-fold),
predictable based on its terminal half-life (8-16 days range), after repeat SC dosing every 2 weeks. No
difference in daclizumab TK parameters were observed in pregnant versus non-pregnant cynomolgus
female monkeys and, while the serum ratio of daclizumab in infant: corresponding mother was observed
to be 1.0, suggesting good transplacental transfer of daclizumab, the ratio of daclizumab in milk: serum
(≤ 0.122%) in lactating cynomolgus monkeys suggested very low excretion of daclizumab via milk in
lactating mothers.
A clinical TPDI study in lieu of nonclinical studies was conducted to evaluate the effect of daclizumab on
CYP activities. Results indicate that daclizumab has no effect on the activities of the major CYP enzymes.

2.3.4. Toxicology
. evaluate potential system TOOur
To evaluate potential systemic effects of daclizumab administration, a single dose GLP intravenous
toxicology study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (PDL.DAC-06.003/ TR07133), which included a
16-day observation period post-dose. The no- observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for this study was
considered to be the highest dose tested, 30 mg/kg.
Repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted with daclizumab administered SC (clinical and
commercial route of administration) q2W.
Two 9-month chronic toxicology studies were conducted. In the first study
(PDL.Dac-04.006/TR07185_3), a NOAEL was not determined due to skin findings, and a significant
number of control animals (93%) had detectable levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). The second study
(P019-11-01) was conducted to define a NOAEL. The first study (PDL. Dac-04.006/ TR07185_3) evaluated
daclizumab doses of 10, 50, 200 mg/kg and the second study evaluated daclizumab doses of 10, 35, 200
mg/kg. The 35 mg/kg dose was tested in the second study to try to find the highest no observed effect
level (NOEL) for a daclizumab-related CNS finding (discussed in more detail below).

RESULTS
· Participant flow
A total of 621 subjects (204 placebo; 208 Daclizumab 150 mg; 209 Daclizumab 300 mg) were
randomized at 78 investigational sites in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, India, Poland, Russia,
Turkey, the Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Evidence of deliberate misdosing was detected at 1 site
during study monitoring, prompting the prospective exclusion of 21 subjects from the efficacy analysis
prior to study completion, resulting in an ITT population of 196 subjects in the placebo group, 201
subjects in the Daclizumab 150 mg group, and 203 subjects in the Daclizumab 300 mg group. The 21
excluded subjects were included in the safety analysis.

· Conduct of the study
The original protocol included one placebo group and three active groups, i.e. 25 mg, 100mg and 200mg.
Doses of 150 mg and 300 mg were ultimately selected based on the fact that a minimum plasma
concentration of 51 ug/ml would be need for the saturation of the CD25 receptor. Sample size was
updated as a result.

4. Change in MSIS-29 physical score at Week 52
The analysis of this endpoint demonstrated a nominally statistically significant benefit in the Daclizumab
150 mg group compared to placebo but not in the Daclizumab 300 mg group. The mean + SD change in
the MSIS-29 physical score from baseline to Week 52 was 3.0 + 13.52 in the placebo group, - 1.0 +
11.80 in the Daclizumab 150 mg group (p = 0.0008 vs. placebo), and 1.4 + 13.53% in the Daclizumab
300 mg group (p = 0.1284 vs. placebo). The difference for Daclizumab 150 mg versus placebo was not
considered statistically significant per the sequential closed testing procedure because the procedure
required that the 300 mg dose group be tested first and achieve statistical significance before the 150 mg
dose group could be tested.

Progression of Disability as Measured by EDSS Score
ger
Confirmed disability progression was defined as a > 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS
≥ 1.0 that was sustained for 12 weeks, or a ≥ 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS of 0
that was sustained for 12 weeks. The difference between treatment groups in confirmed disability
progression was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for baseline EDSS (EDSS ≤
2.5 vs. EDSS >2.5), history of prior IFN ß use, and baseline age (age ≤ 35 versus age > 35 years).
In the primary analysis, the hazard ratio for daclizumab/IFN ß -1a was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.07),
indicating daclizumab reduced the risk of disability progression by 16% (p=0.1575) compared with IFN ß
-1a.

their last EDSS assessment.
4: For baseline EDSS assessment, the value obtained at Screening
was used for 5 subjects (2 for the IFN beta-la group and 3 for
DAC HYP 150 mg group) and Week 12 for subject 3010125 in IFN
beta-la group.

In the primary analysis of 12-week confirmed disability progression, all subjects who had a tentative
disability progression and did not have an available confirmatory assessment were assumed to be
nonprogressors and were censored at the time of the last assessment. A prespecified sensitivity analysis
of 12-week confirmed disability progression was performed based on the alternative assumption that
confirmed disability progression would occur at a similar rate as that for subjects who completed the
confirmatory assessment in the trial (after adjustment for treatment group, baseline EDSS, change in
EDSS at time of tentative progression, and presence of a relapse within the 29 days prior to the tentative
progression. In this analysis, daclizumab reduced the risk of 12-week confirmed disability progression by
21% as compared with the IFN ß -1a group (hazard ratio [daclizumab/IFN ß -1a] of 0.79 [95% CI: 0.62,
1.00; p=0.0469]). An additional prespecified sensitivity analysis was carried out in which all tentative
progressions with no confirmation assessment were assumed to be confirmed. In this analysis,

Efficacy by Da Choose
DATE: 30SEP2014
Efficacy by Antibody Status
The impact of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) on efficacy has been
explored by summarizing key efficacy endpoints by AB status.
Treatment-emergent ADAs to Daclizumab150 mg were observed in 4% and 19% of evaluable subjects in
Studies 201 and 301, respectively. The majority (12% [110/913]) of the treatment emergent ADA
responses in Study 301 were transient (defined as positive evaluations other than final evaluations that
are non-consecutive or are consecutive but <74 days apart), and the minority (7% [65/913]) were
persistent. Treatment-emergent NAbs to Daclizumab150 mg were observed in 3% and 8% of evaluable

subjects in Studies 201 and 301, respectively. The majority of ADA and NAb reactivity to
daclizumaboccurred early during treatment and decreased with continuing daclizumab treatment.
The impact of ADAs and NAbs on efficacy was explored by summarizing clinical endpoints (relapses) and
radiological endpoints. In Study 301, the adjusted annualized relapse rate was comparable for both
AB-positive and AB-negative daclizumab-treated subjects. Similarly, there was no detectable impact of
ADAs or NAbs on the number of Gd+ lesions or the number of new or newly enlarging T2 hyperintense
lesions at Week 24 and Week 96. With the limitations of the low incidence of AB-positive subjects in Study
201, the adjusted annualized relapse rate was similar between daclizumab-treated ADA-positive and
ADA-negative subjects. The percentage of subjects that were relapse-free at 1 year was comparable for
ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups. Similar results were observed for the Nab positive or
Nab-negative subjects.
The mean number of new Gd lesions at 1 year in Study 201 was similar for ADA-positive and
ADA-negative daclizumab-treated subjects, and the percentage of subjects with no Gd+ lesions at 1 year
on cranial MRI was similar in the ADA-positive and ADA-negative groups. Similar results were observed
for the NAb-positive or NAb-negative subjects.
L
Overall, immunogenicity to daclizumab was typically transient and most often occurred during the first
year of treatment. There was no discernible impact of ADAs or NAbs on efficacy during treatment with
daclizumab.

Redefined "high disease activity"
The applicant redefined "high disease activity" and this modified definition added a second criterion to the
definition used in the applicant's primary analysis as shown below.
. Subjects with 2 or more relapses in 1 year, and with 1 or more Gd-enhancing lesions on brain
MRI, or
· Subjects who failed to respond to a full and adequate course (at least 1 year of treatment) of prior
DMT treatment, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and at least
9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or having an
unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 years
Subjects who did not meet the criteria for high disease activity were classified in our analyses as having
low/unknown disease activity.
To facilitate the assessment of benefit/risk based on this new definition of high disease activity, analyses
were performed on the data from Study 201 and Study 301 for the following endpoints by baseline
disease activity level:
•
Overall summary of adverse events (AEs)
•
Incidence of maximum values in liver function tests (Study 301 only)
•
Annualized relapse rate (using INEC confirmed relapses)
•
Number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions
•
6-month sustained disability progression
Study 201
In Study 201, the overall AE profile was similar for the subjects with high and low/unknown disease
activity at baseline. The incidence of AEs and SAEs reported were also similar among subjects with high

Patient exposure
The placebo-controlled studies consists of data from 417 patients who received Daclizumab at 150 mg SC
(n=208) or 300 mg SC (n=209), and 204 subjects who received placebo for a period of up to 1 year,
representing 423 subject-years of overall exposure to Daclizumab, 211 and 212 subject-years on
Daclizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively.
In the active-controlled experience, 919 patients received Daclizumab 150 mg and 922 subjects received
IFN ß-1a for periods of up to 3 years. The mean (median) time on treatment was 100.54 (111.43) weeks
for the IFN ß-1a group and 102.04 (108.71) weeks for the daclizumab group. The total number of
subject-years of exposure was 1872.9 years in the IFN ß-1a and 1952.2 years in the daclizumab group.
For the total daclizumab experience, 1785 patients in the safety population were dosed for periods up to
6 years and the total number of subject-years exposed to daclizumab was 4098. Approximately 60% of
the subjects in the total daclizumab group were exposed to at least 25 months of daclizumab.

There is a slight difference between the number of pts exposed to the proposed dose (816) and the
previous value for pts exposed to the proposed dose range (831) but this may reflect the fact that some
pts may have been treated with a near 150 mg dose, without a real 150 mg dose. This was not considered
an issue.
Overall, the safety database is robust and sufficient for identifying uncommon risks and may also be able
to detect risks with an incidence as low as 1 in 1000 subject-years associated with daclizumab.

Adverse events
The safety results in this section are presented for the placebo-controlled daclizumab experience (Study
205MS201, 1 year of exposure), the active-controlled daclizumab experience (Study 205MS301, 2 to 3
years of exposure), and the total daclizumab experience for controlled and uncontrolled studies (up to 6
years of daclizumab exposure). The placebo-controlled, active controlled and total daclizumab analyses
included all available information from the first dose of treatment up to 180 days after the last dose of any
study treatment in the subject's last study, regardless of whether the subject received alternative MS
therapy. All AE analyses in this section are presented according to the principle of treatment emergence.
Placebo-Controlled Experience
· In Study 205MS201, the overall incidence of AEs was similar across groups (79% placebo, 73%
and 76% in the Daclizumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively). The majority of subjects
had AEs that were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of subjects with severe AEs was 3%
in the placebo group, 4% in the Daclizumab 150 mg group, and 6% in the Daclizumab 300 mg
group. The incidence of subjects with treatment-related AEs was higher in the daclizumab group
than in the placebo group (22% placebo, 29% Daclizumab 150 mg, 35% Daclizumab 300 mg).

daclizumab for all evaluable subjects who received daclizumab (either 150 mg or 300 mg). There was no
correlation with AEs or SAEs based on antibody-positive or -negative status for either ADAs or NAbs. Also,
there was no pattern of association between antibody status and anaphylaxis/ hypersensitivity type

signal of daclizumab related to concomitant IV treatment with corticosteroids was identified.
Interaction with antispastic agents or fampridine has not been discussed at MA submission. Upon request
the applicant performed an analysis which did not find any relation suggesting a DDI. The applicant did
not perform drug-drug specific trials. All data available for analysis came from efficacy trials. DAC is a
monoclonal antibody which does not affect directly other frequently used concomitant treatments which
include baclophen, diazepam / tetrazepam, tizanidine and tolperisone. As for fampridine, of all patients
enrolled, only 15 were concomitantly treated with daclizumab and fampridine. Evaluation of the AE profile
of each DAC-other agent combination did not reveal any discrepancy when compared to DAC alone +
other agent alone. Considering that from a pharmacological point of view it is also not expected that
interactions may occur on a clinically relevant level, the applicant explanation may be accepted.
Discontinuation due to AES
In the total daclizumab experience, the overall incidence of AEs that led to discontinuation of study
treatment was 14%. SOCs with incidence > 1% of AEs by SOC leading to study treatment discontinuation
in the total daclizumab group were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (4%), investigations (4%) and
nervous system disorders (1%). AEs by PT that led to treatment discontinuation in ≥ 1% of subjects in the

total daclizumab experience were ALT increased (2%), LFT abnormal (1%), and MS relapse (1%). The
incidence of AEs that led to treatment discontinuation remained stable over time, ranging from 4% to 6%
per year.
In the total daclizumab experience, the incidence of AEs that led to withdrawal from study was 9%. In
general, the pattern of AEs leading to withdrawal from the study was similar to that observed for AEs
leading to discontinuation of study treatment. The most common AEs by SOC leading to study withdrawal
are investigations (3%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (2%). AEs by PT that led to
withdrawal from study in ≥ 1% of subjects included ALT increased (1%).
2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety
Red
The safety of Daclizumab 150 mg has been characterized in clinical studies of 1785 MS subjects treated
for up to 6 years, accounting for approximately 4100 subject-years of exposure. During the accumulation
of this safety data, several important risks have emerged, including elevations of liver transaminases and
hepatic injury, cutaneous events, infections, depression and colitis and strategies and approaches to
monitor and mitigate these risks have been implemented and tested in the clinical studies.
daclizumab is associated with a risk of elevations of serum transaminases and cases of hepatic injury.
Most often this risk manifests as a transient and asymptomatic increase in ALT/AST that resolves
spontaneously or with discontinuation of dosing. In a small number of cases, serious events of hepatic
injury, characterized by concomitant elevations of serum transaminases and bilirubin, were identified in
which daclizumab may have played at least a significant contributory role based on independent
adjudication of the events. With the exception of a fatal case of autoimmune hepatitis early in the clinical
development program, prompt identification of these cases, discontinuation of daclizumab, and
treatment of underlying or other contributory causes resulted in favourable outcomes. While a single dose
of daclizumab given at the time of a transaminase abnormality generally did not appear to worsen or
prolong events, the single case of fatal autoimmune hepatitis occurred in the setting of repeated
administration of daclizumab during the elevation. Treatment discontinuation for patients meeting certain
criteria (and possibly for others, based on physician judgment) is appropriate to limit the severity of the
event and to reduce the risk of recurrence in susceptible individuals. The most common cutaneous events
during daclizumab use were dermatitis, eczema, and rashes, which were manageable with treatment,
including topical and/or systemic steroids, and treatment discontinuation. Some cases were serious and
had features of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. These cases typically presented with a more
generalized, diffuse rash and some cases required multiple courses of corticosteroids. While the most
serious cases could be a source of significant discomfort to patients, the integrity of the skin was
preserved and none of the events were directly life-threatening. Overall, the use of corticosteroids
appeared to result in rapid improvement of many of the more serious cases. Over time, events generally
resolved or substantially improved without permanent injury to the skin.
Infections were composed mainly of upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, and viral infections typical of
those seen in a non-immunocompromised MS population. While the incidence of both minor and serious
infections was increased during daclizumab use, the pattern and outcome of the events indicated that the
ability of the subjects' immune system to effectively respond to the infection was preserved. Overall, the
infections that have occurred during daclizumab use have been manageable with standard care, and the
incidence of infections necessitating discontinuation of study treatment has been <1%.
Serious cases of colitis characterized by prolonged diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal pain have been
reported in < 1% of subjects treated with daclizumab. These events have had a late onset, occurring after
1 year of treatment. These cases had features different from Crohn's disease and did not progress to have

product of high purity and demonstrating greater structural homogeneity than Zenapax. In particular,
Zinbryta has lower levels of high mannose and other non-fucosylated glycans than Zenapax, and also
lacks glycan structures of murine origin.
Non Clinical and Clinical aspects
The applicant claimed that structural glycosylation is a critical determinant of the therapeutic function of
an antibody. In the case of Zinbryta, the differences in glycosylation (resulting from the modifications to
the expression system and the cell cultivation conditions) manifest in significant differences in
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties which could change the safety and/or efficacy profile
of the product and, therefore, differentiate daclizumab in Zinbryta from the daclizumab in Zenapax
These pharmacological effects seen with Zinbryta are related to:
a. differences in biological activity as measured by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC)
b. in vivo clearance, and hence the extent of systemic exposure to the circulating therapeutic protein;
c. immunogenicity; and
d. binding to the biologically relevant receptors which are linked mechanistically to the homeostasis of T
regulatory cells.

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) measures the killing of antibody-coated target
cells by cytotoxic effector cells. This biological effect is triggered through interaction of target-bound
antibodies with Fc gamma receptors (FcyRs) present on the surface of effector cells. IgG Fc glycans are
required for optimal binding of the antibody to FcyRs and for the effector functions that control the clinical
properties of some therapeutic antibodies [Arnold 2007; Shi and Goudar 2014]. Natural killer (NK) cells
mediate ADCC. NK cells are activated to lyse target cells when Fc receptors expressed on the surface of
NK cells binds the Fc portion of antibodies bound to target cells. CD16 (FcyRIII) is the predominant Fcy
receptor expressed on NK cells.
Consistent with the differences in glycan profile, Zinbryta had a significantly lower binding potency for
CD16 than Zenapax as measured in an AlphaScreen competitive binding assay. The relative binding of
Zenapax to CD16 is 156% compared to Zinbryta. As a result, Zinbryta induces less down-modulation of
CD16 on NK cells than Zenapax under in vitro conditions designed to replicate those of the in vitro ADCC
assay.
My APOLOGIES
Consistent with the differences in CD16 binding and CD16 down-modulation on NK cells, Zinbryta has a
significant reduction in ADCC activity in vitro when compared to Zenapax. The maximal ADCC activity
achieved with Zinbryta tested at graded concentrations was approximately 30-40% lower than the
activity elicited by the same concentration of Zenapax.
Zinbryta has significantly (p<0.05) reduced levels of in vitro cytotoxicity in comparison to levels observed
for Zenapax when effects of increasing concentrations of antibody were evaluated against fixed Effector
to Target (E: T) ratios. Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity was measured by 51Cr release from IL-2
receptor-expressing KIT-225 K6 target cells in the presence of human peripheral blood mononucleated
(PBMC) effector cells. The level of cytotoxicity was calculated as a percentage of maximum cell lysis.
Mean and Standard Error results were obtained from six independent experiments using peripheral blood
mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors.

Zinbryta has significantly (p<0.05) reduced levels of ADCC in comparison to levels observed for Zenapax
when effects of a single antibody concentration was evaluated against changes in Effector to Target (E: T)
ratios in vitro.
The differences in ADCC activity can be linked to the differences in glycan profile between Zinbryta and
Zenapax. In particular, Zinbryta has lower levels of high mannose and other non-fucosylated glycans than
Zenapax. High mannose (non-fucosylated) glycans are well described to enhance ADCC activity in vitro
and target cell depletion in vivo [Shi and Goudar 2014]. This general effect of increased high-mannose
glycans causing increased ADCC was specifically demonstrated for daclizumabFigure 13. A high-mannose
daclizumab was generated and mixed with Zinbryta at varying percentages of antibodies with high
mannose glycans to reflect varying glycan profiles. Reflecting the comparison between Zinbryta and
Zenapax, as the percentage of high mannose species increases, ADCC activity increases. Thus, the
glycan structural differences between Zinbryta and Zenapax are manifested as a change in biological
activity, specifically as reduced in vitro ADCC activity for Zinbryta, which is relevant to an assessment of
the safety profile.

Differences in Clinical Immunogenicity as a Safety Measure
Glycan modifications of therapeutic antibodies directly impact functional properties and immunogenicity.
Altered glycosylation patterns may decrease or increase the immunogenic properties of mAbs, e.g. alpha
Gal. Non-typical glycosylation patterns, e.g. as encountered when adopting entirely novel expression
systems, may introduce a higher immunogenicity risk as compared with more commonly used expression
systems (Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of mAb intended for in vivo clinical use -

impact in vivo. Glycosylation is generally not considered a distinctive attribute unless the primary mode
of action is associated to a specific structure and a given function related to the indication.
ADCC was not considered to be the primary mode of action for this product targeted to compete with the
IL-2 receptor present in activated lymphocytes. This CD25 binding was the mechanism of action
considered for potency determination measuring proliferation inhibition of T-cell expressing CD25 when
exposed to IL-2. CD25 binding is not affected by variations in the content of these various glycan variants.
In order to further substantiate the NAS claim, it is required to establish whether the differences in
glycosylation profile translate in significant differences in terms of safety and/or efficacy. This can only be
addressed more appropriately at the non-clinical and clinical level.
CHMP assessment of the Applicant's arguments on the non-clinical aspects:
seo
The applicant has presented in vitro data showing that the material differences in glycosylation (resulting
from the modifications to the expression system and the cell cultivation conditions) manifest in significant
differences in:
- differences in biological activity as measured by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
in vitro;
- in vivo clearance, and hence the extent of systemic exposure to the circulating therapeutic protein;
- immunogenicity ;
- binding to the biologically relevant receptors which are linked mechanistically to the homeostasis of T
regulatory cells.
Although a direct clinical comparison of the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic rates of the two
products was not feasible, non-clinical data were provided by the applicant to demonstrate differences in
ADCC activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
CHMP Conclusions on non-clinical aspects!
From a non-clinical perspective data were provided to reveal differences in ADCC activity,
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that may be relevant to assume a different
safety and efficacy profile of Zinbryta, but these needed to be further confirmed by clinical data.
Taking into account the clinical assessment and the clarifications provided by the company during the
assessment, it became clear that the assumptions arising from the non-clinical data did not translate into
a clinically relevant safety and efficacy different profile for Zinbryta when compared to Zenapax, as
further elaborated below.
CHMP assessment of the Applicant's arguments on the clinical aspects:
Differences in glycan profile and ADCC activity have been elaborated further during the procedure. The
argument centres on the differences in ADCC observed and the mechanistic link to the pharmacodynamic
effects on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and to the assessment of the safety profile in MS patients. The role
of Treg cells in limiting immune activation and autoimmune pathology is discussed in the context of the
pathophysiology of MS. Reduction in Treg cells are hypothesised to increase incidence of autoimmune
events and potentially limit efficacy. The Applicant provided details supporting this hypothesis. The higher
degree of ADCC in Zenapax is considered by the applicant to potentially increase Treg depletion relative
to Zinbryta with the associated consequences concerning safety and efficacy from increased autoimmune
pathologies. This leads the Company to conclude that the lower ADCC activity of Zinbryta compared to
Zenapax is potentially beneficial for safety by limiting the depletion of CD25-expressing Treg cells.

From the data available on MS patients treated with daclizumab manufactured at Penzberg (DAC
Penzberg), the safety data - namely regarding Nabs against daclizumab, favours Zinbryta over DAC
Penzberg with 7.9% NAbs in MS patients treated with doses up to 200 mg in study DAC 1012) against the
frequency of 2% of Nabs with Zinbryta. The NAbs of Zenapax in a different population is less prone to an
adequate comparison. The Applicant claims that this is indicative of Zenapax being potentially more
immunogenic than Zinbryta in the absence of direct comparison of immunogenicity via a head to head
clinical study. This information is unexpected given the relative immunogenicity of the different routes of
injection (intravenous for Zenapax and subcutaneous for Zinbryta).
Glycan mediated clearance has been discussed and reference made to published data which reports
Zinbryta has a 30% reduced clearance rate compared to Zenapax.
There are no clinical data adequately comparing efficacy of Zenapax and Zinbryta in MS patients.
The applicant argued that, based on the immunological responses observed for DAC Penzberg, Zenapax
and Zinbryta, which may correlate to the differences in the glycan profile, there should be a significant
difference in clinical properties. A significant part of the claim of the clinical significance of the differences
in the quality profiles between Zenapax and Zinbryta was hypothesised by extrapolation of available
clinical information and based on biological and clinical plausibility. The CHMP considered though that the
applicant's argumentation and data provided were insufficient to substantiate that the differences
observed with Zinbryta translate into significant differences in term of safety and efficacy.
The Applicant followed to present in further detail the differences in molecular structure and how this
would impact upon clinical response, namely: a) PK modelling comparing clearance and extrapolating the
impact on efficacy; b) how these differences could be clinically meaningful; c) how Zinbryta lower Treg
depletion could translate into potential beneficial safety outcomes; and d) describe the observed
differences in immunogenicity.
Regarding the PK/PD impact of glycosylation and the potential meaning of these differences, the
presented model exhibited several problems:
the applicant ased 10% confidence es. [ the
· the applicant used a 90% confidence interval instead of the usual 95% to show non-equivalence;
. the applicant assumed that patients weighed a mean of 75 kg (DAC-1012 dosing being 1mg/kg Q4W
- max dosing 100 mg or 2 mg/kg Q2W - max dosing 200 mg per visit 6 doses max) while in trial
205MS201 dosing was 150 or 300 mg Q4W 6 month treatment.
. Moreover, all DAC1012 patients were on beta interferon (IfN) treatment while all 205MS201 were not.
Considering all these aspects, the clinical data provided could not be considered comparable, as the
population was substantially different, and the administered treatment was also not identical. Likewise,
the prediction of 14% lower exposure of DAC Penzberg as compared to Zinbryta could not be directly
linked to an improved efficacy profile, as the DAC Penzberg was tested in patients receiving beta IfN
The applicant tried to highlight that patients on DAC Penzberg had 12.6% more cutaneous AEs as
compared to placebo whilst patients on Zinbryta had only 7% more cutaneous AEs as compared to
placebo. Again, the CHMP considered that in this case the population was different: in the placebo arm,
26% of DAC 1012 patients exhibited cutaneous events while in the 205MS201 placebo arm only 13% had
cutaneous AEs. Moreover, cutaneous AEs were more frequent in the DAC 1012 trial than in the
205MS201. This fact (which reduces the clinical relevance of these AEs for effectiveness and safety), and
more importantly the fact that the DAC 1012 population was concomitantly treated with beta IfN further

· Daclizumab is the first MS therapy whose primary mechanism of action is related to the modulation of
IL-2 signaling, and its immunologic effects are reversible in a time frame consistent with its serum
half-life.
· Daclizumab provides superior efficacy to IM IFN ß-1a, currently one of the most widely used
treatments for RMS, and the efficacy of daclizumab was evident across the spectrum of the RMS study
populations with respect to key factors such as prior treatment history, level of MS inflammatory
activity, and EDSS range at baseline. Daclizumab was significantly effective versus placebo and
versus IM IFN ß-1a in subjects with highly active and less active subgroups .
· Daclizumab will be the first approved MS therapy that has a monthly SC dosing regimen.
RMS patients with highly active MS are at elevated risk for long-term disability progression, and achieving
early and complete control of MS activity with DMTs is currently recommended to provide a patient with
the best opportunity to preserve function. High-efficacy DMTs are the mainstay of treatment for these
patients, but their response to any individual treatment is variable, and therefore it is beneficial for
physicians to have several treatments with differentiated mechanisms of action from which to select and
tailor therapy.
For patients with active MS and who need a high-efficacy MS therapeutic but have known risk factors for
the serious adverse effects of other MS therapies that have shown superior efficacy to IFN ß-1a (e.g.,
patients who are JCV positive [in the case of natalizumab] or patients with cardiac disease [in the case of
fingolimod]), or for those patients who are concerned about long-term immunosuppression and do not
want to use a potentially irreversible therapy (such as alemtuzumab), daclizumab provides atreatment
alternative although it should be noted that no information is available as for the risk of PML following
treatment with Zinbryta.
RMS patients with less active forms of MS may also benefit from high-efficacy MS therapies considering
the present therapeutic goal of eliminating MS activity as completely as possible to preserve function over
the long term.
Benefit-risk balance
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance
The CHMP considers that daclizumab has shown statistically and clinically robust data in patients suffering
from Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis. The clinical and MRI effect seen with the treatment was reproduced in
several studies over up to 3 years and it was established that maintenance of treatment beyond one year
was beneficial. The most significant adverse events relate to hepatic injury and elevated hepatic
enzymes, infections, cutaneous reactions and depression.
The risk of hepatic injury and elevated liver enzymes is clear and monthly monitoring of liver enzymes is
required during treatment and amendments have been made in the Product Information documents to
guide monitoring of hepatic function. Monitoring of white blood cells and a warning regarding cases of
tuberculosis in patients treated with daclizumab has also been implemented, and the present risk
minimisation strategies are considered sufficient.
