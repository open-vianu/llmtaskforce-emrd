2. Scientific discussion

2.1. Introduction

This application for a marketing authorisation of Silodosin Recordati 4 mg hard capsules and Silodosin Recordati 8 mg hard capsules, concerns a generic application of a centrally authorised medicinal product according to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

The reference medicinal product (RMP) is Urorec 4 mg hard capsules and Urorec 8 mg hard capsules EU/1/09/608-001-014, for which marketing authorisation was granted in the European Union on 29 January 2010 on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.

Recordati Ireland Ltd. is the applicant of the generic MAA and the MAH of the RMP, and they will be produced to identical quality standards using identical manufacturing processes and batch testing processes at the same manufacturing sites. Qualitative and quantitative composition of Silodosin Recordati capsules is the same as in the RMP, thus the proposed generic product is identical in every respect to the reference product aside from the invented product name.

Silodosin Recordati is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men.

The recommended dose is one capsule of Silodosin Recordati 8 mg daily. For special patient populations, one capsule of Silodosin Recordati 4 mg daily is recommended.

Silodosin is an a-adrenoceptor antagonist with high selectivity for the a1A-adrenoreceptors (primarily located in the lower urinary tract) relative to @ 18-adrenoreceptors (primarily located in the cardiovascular system). In vitro studies have shown that silodosin has a remarkably high @1A:018 binding ratio (162: 1). Blockade of a 1A-adrenoreceptors causes smooth muscle in these tissues to relax, thus decreasing bladder outlet resistance, without affecting detrusor smooth muscle contractility. This causes an improvement of both storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) symptoms (lower urinary tract symptoms, LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

2.2. Quality aspects

2.2.1. Introduction

The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 4 and 8 mg of silodosin as active substance.

Other ingredients are:

Capsule content - starch, pregelatinised (maize), mannitol (E421), magnesium stearate, sodium laurilsulfate. Capsule shell - gelatin, titanium dioxide (E171), yellow iron oxide (E172) (4 mg capsules only).

The product is available in PVC/PVDC/aluminium blisters in carton pack.

2.2.2. Active Substance

General information

The chemical name of silodosin is (-)- 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-5-[(2R)-2-({ 2-[2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenoxy]ethyl} amino) propyl]-2,3-dihydro- 1

Figure 1: active substance structure

The chemical structure of silodosin was elucidated by a combination of MS (ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS), UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 19F-NMR spectroscopy, two dimensional NMR spectroscopy (COSY, NOESY, HMCQ and HMBC) and elemental analysis. The absolute stereochemistry was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography and optical rotation. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by powder X-ray diffraction, IR, solid-state 13C-NMR and thermal analysis (TG/DSC and TG/DTA).

Silodosin is a white to pale yellowish white powder and it is odourless. It is not considered to be hygroscopic and it is very soluble in acetic acid, freely soluble in methanol, N, N-dimethylformamide, and ethanol, sparingly soluble in 1-octanol, and very slightly soluble in water. Silodosin can exist in three polymorphic forms. The consistency and stability of produced crystalline form has been sufficiently demonstrated as well.

Silodosin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by chiral HPLC.

Silodosin is not included in current European Pharmacopoeia

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls

Two ASMFs of the same holder with different manufacturing sites are submitted, with the same synthesis route applied for production of the same polymorphic form and the same quality requirements established for silodosin active substance manufactured by the processes described in each ASMF.

Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of each ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.

Silodosin is synthesized from commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.

Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for raw materials (starting materials, reagents, solvents and auxiliary materials) have been presented. One critical step as well as one critical intermediate in the production of Silodosin has been identified with adequate in-process controls in place.

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances.

Silodosin related substances including degradation products and potential impurities such as by-products produced during the manufacturing process were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. In addition, residual solvents, elemental impurities and genotoxic impurities were adequately identified and controlled.

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 9/16

Compliance of the primary packaging with the Ph. Eur. and Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 (as amended) has been confirmed by each ASM.

Specification

Release and shelf life specifications for active substance are presented in the relevant ASMF. The release specification includes tests for description, identification, melting point, heavy metals, residue on ignition, related substances, optical isomer, assay and residual solvents. In shelf life specification only stability indicating parameters are proposed with addition of water content testing. When available and applicable, compendial JP methods are used.

The appropriate specifications for impurities including residual solvents, in line with ICH Q3C have been set. The batch analysis results of recent active substance batches (3 pilot and at least 3 at commercial scale) manufactured with the current process of drug substance are provided. The currently approved analytical methods were applied. All results are within the acceptance criteria. The current information on reference standards is presented as well.

The results for representative batches of silodosin (3 batches manufactured at each active substance manufacturing site) are provided by the applicant. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Stability

Stability data for 6 batches (3 pilot and 3 productions scale) of active substance stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch.

The analytical methods used were the same as for release.

All tested parameters were within the specifications. Degradation products increased under accelerated conditions but remained within the specification. One batch was also exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. According to the results of photostability testing the active substance exposed directly to light showed increased levels of three known impurities as well as unspecified impurities. When protected from the light, the active substance has shown good stability.

The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months for the active substance, when stored in the original container at room temperature and protected from light.

2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product

Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development

The finished product consists of hard gelatin capsules, containing 4 mg or 8 mg of silodosin, in a homothetic formulation that uses well known pharmaceutical excipients. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the generic finished product, dosage form and strengths are the same as of the reference medicinal product, thus the proposed generic product is identical in every respect to the reference product. Information on the development of the generic finished product is the same as for the reference medicinal product as well (the applicant of the generic finished product and the MAH of the reference medicinal product is the same).

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 10/16


All information regarding the choice of the active substance and the excipients are sufficiently justified. The main aim of the formulation development was to obtain a composition with good homogeneity and performance (disintegration and dissolution) characteristics. The manufacturer developed silodosin 8 mg capsules with a content which is proportionally similar in its active and inactive ingredients to the 4 mg capsules already marketed. It is noted that there are no changes in the manufacture of the blend of the two strengths. Comparative dissolution profiles were obtained for the 4 mg and 8 mg capsules using three different dissolution media pH 1.2, 4.5, 6.8. Based on the disintegration data and dissolution results provided and according to the "Note of Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence" CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 the applicant justified the absence of an in-vivo test to demonstrate the equivalence of the different capsules formulations.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The primary packaging is opaque PVC/PVCD/aluminium blisters. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls

The manufacturing process consists of 7 main steps: mixing, kneading, granulation, drying, sieving and mixing, capsule filling and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process and is adequately described.

Process validation data for all proposed batch sizes at both proposed manufacturing sites are provided demonstrating that the manufacturing process is validated. Recordati Ireland Ltd. is the applicant of the generic MAA and the MAH of the RMP, and they will be produced to identical quality standards using identical manufacturing processes and batch testing processes at the same manufacturing sites.

It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.

Product specification

The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, dosage uniformity, identity, assay, impurities, dissolution, and microbial count. All parameters tested at release are included in the shelf life specifications as well.

Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. A risk assessment on elemental impurities according to ICH Q3D has been carried out.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for three manufacturing scale batches for each site and strength confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture in compliance with the intended finished product specification.

Stability of the product

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 11/16

Stability data on 4 pilot and 3 industrial scale batches of 4 mg strength as well as 2 pilot and 3 industrial scale batches of 8 mg strength and 2 commercial scale batches of both strengths of the finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25°C/60% RH), for up to 12 months at 30°C/65%RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

For batches of both finished product strengths, the results for appearance and dissolution at each testing conditions comply with specifications as well as the results for assay, related substances and microbial count at long term and intermediate storage conditions.

At accelerated storage conditions (40°C/75% RH) an increase in degradation product is observed at the 3 month time-point with out of specification results obtained for some of the 4 mg capsules batches. At the 6 month time-point the degradation product is out of specification in almost all batches, for both strengths. The assay values are out of specification in some batches, mainly for the 4 mg strength. Results for appearance, dissolution and microbial count are within acceptance criteria.

In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. According to the results of photostability studies capsules exposed directly to light showed increased levels of both specified impurities as well as unspecified impurities, while the samples in the proposed market packaging showed no significant change in the appearance of the capsules, assay or content of related substances.

Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions: "Store the product in the original package in order to protect the product from light and moisture. Do not store above 30°C.", as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

Adventitious agents

Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of gelatine used in the manufacture of finished product are provided.

2.2.4. Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 12/16

2.3. Non-clinical aspects

2.3.1. Introduction

A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.

Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.

2.3.2. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment

No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of Silodosin Recordati is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all Silodosin containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar.

2.3.3. Discussion on non-clinical aspects

The non-clinical overview provided is based on literature review and studies submitted in Module 2.6 in the Marketing Authorisation Application of the reference medicinal product. Recordati Ireland Ltd. is the applicant of the generic MAA and the MAH of the RMP and this summary is considered acceptable.

Justification for not providing ERA studies for this generic product is accepted.

2.3.4. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

There are no objections to approval of Silodosin Recordati 4 mg hard capsules and Silodosin Recordati 8 mg hard capsules from the nonclinical point of view.

2.4. Clinical aspects

2.4.1. Introduction

This is an application for Silodosin Recordati 4 mg and 8 mg hard capsules containing Silodosin. The applicant provided a Clinical Overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as efficacy and safety of silodosin based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference medicinal product.

Since Silodosin Recordati is an auto-generic of Urorec, the clinical data in support of the Silodosin Recordati application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Urorec dossier, which have been assessed and authorised (including all post-marketing procedures).

Exemption

Exemption for bioequivalence studies for Silodosin Recordati 4 mg and 8 mg hard capsules can be justified considering that the proposed generic medicinal product is a duplicate of the RMP. Silodosin Recordati and the

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 13/16

related RMP are both manufactured by the same manufacturing sites and apart from the invented name they are identical in every respect (composition, pharmaceutical formulation, strength, manufacturing process, testing).

2.4.2. Pharmacodynamics

No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.

2.4.3. Post marketing experience

No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

2.4.4. Discussion on clinical aspects

An adequate Clinical Overview containing a sufficient outline of the published literature regarding the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety of silodosin has been submitted.

2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical aspects

2.7. Product information

2.7.1. User consultation

No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Urorec 4 mg/8 mg hard capsules. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

3. Benefit-risk balance

This application concerns a generic version of Silodosin 4 mg hard capsules and Silodosin 8 mg hard capsules. The reference product Urorec is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult men. No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant's clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient.

The proposed generic medicinal product is a duplicate of the reference medicinal product and both products are

Assessment report EMA/CHMP/845183/2018

Page 15/16

manufactured by the same manufacturing sites and apart from the invented name they are identical in every respect (composition, pharmaceutical formulation, strength, manufacturing process, testing). Therefore demonstration of bioequivalence by means of further studies can be waived and a benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can be concluded.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

4. Recommendation

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Silodosin Recordati is favourable in the following indication:
