2.1. Problem statement
2.1.1. Disease or condition
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare, X-linked, metabolic disease in which dysfunction or lack of the
ALD protein (ALDP) is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D member 1
(ABCD1) gene. ALDP is a peroxisomal transport protein involved in the transport and degradation of
very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), leading to accumulation of VLCFAs, which occurs most prominently
in the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord.
Cerebral ALD (CALD) is the most severe form of ALD, affecting approximately 40% of boys with ALD,
typically during childhood. CALD is characterised by rapidly progressive cerebral demyelination leading
to progressive, irreversible loss of neurologic function. If untreated, nearly half of patients with CALD
die within 5 years of symptom onset.
2.1.2. Epidemiology and screening tools
The worldwide incidence of ALD among newborn males has been estimated to be approximately 1 in
21,000 among live births, but incidences between 1:17,000 to 1:100,000 have been reported
(Wiesinger et al., 2015). There appears to be no major differences in incidence rates of ALD between
countries around the world. There is no genotype-phenotype correlation, i.e. whether a newborn child
genetically diagnosed with a mutated ABCD1 gene will develop the aggressive form cerebral ALD
during childhood (normally between 2-12 years of age) or only milder disease in adult age cannot be
determined based on the type of gene mutation.
The 2 most common neurologic ALD phenotypes manifestations are childhood cerebral
adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which together account for
approximately 80% of all cases. AMN is characterised by slowly progressive predominantly axonal
degeneration and affects the spinal cord and to a lesser extent peripheral nerves and typically develop
during adulthood. In contrast, childhood CALD is characterised by rapidly progressive cerebral
demyelination, resulting in death or vegetative state in most patients within 3 years of onset.
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 11/136
Newborn screening programmes for ALD are underway in several countries; the Minister of Health in
the Netherlands has approved the addition of adrenoleukodystrophy to the newborn screening
programme. In the USA, ALD was added to the recommended uniform screening panel in 2016.
For boys with a genetic diagnosis of ALD, monitoring of white matter involvement by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is used to objectively determine the onset of CALD signs and
identify patients at high risk for rapid progression (i.e. the subgroup of 40% who develop CALD). When
signs of CALD have developed, the patient should be treated.
2.1.3. Aetiology and pathogenesis
It is not known why 40% of boys with a genetic diagnosis will develop the rapidly progressive cerebral
demyelination form of ALD, the cerebral ALD (CALD). There is no genotype-phenotype correlation.
However, in some cases, head trauma appears to have been some kind of trigger, preceding the
development of neuroinflammation and cerebral ALD.
2.1.4. Clinical presentation
Disease progression and neurologic decline in patients with CALD have been documented in natural
history studies; patients experience critical deficits across multiple neurological domains within a short
period after onset of clinical symptoms. In children diagnosed with CALD, learning and behavioural
problems are often observed at the time of disease onset in early- to mid-childhood (median age 7
years) with progressive gait, vision, and hearing impairments within 6 to 15 months of symptom onset.
This is typically followed by rapid neurologic functional decline.
2.1.5. Management
There is currently no medicine approved for treatment of CALD.
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a therapeutic option that has been
used for a few decades and that can stabilize progression of CALD. The best outcomes are observed if
it is performed at early stages of cerebral involvement.
Allo-HSCT is thought to enable migration of donor-derived cells into the brain, which include donor-
derived macrophages and/or microglial cells that express functional ALDP and function normally,
thereby stopping further demyelination. Although allo-HSCT has been reported to stabilize CALD, the
full effects of transplant are not immediately apparent; demyelinating lesions usually continue to
progress for 12 to 18 months post-transplant with some clinical progression observed. No effect has
been seen on other disease manifestations of ALD, such as adrenal insufficiency, and the slowly
developing spinal and peripheral nerves neuropathy in adulthood. It is anticipated that Skysona will
only have beneficial effects on the cerebral inflammation part of the disease, just as has been observed
for allo-HSCT treatment.
Allo-HSCT procedure also involves a pre-transplant myeloablative and lymphocyte-depleting
conditioning regimen. In addition, because the cells received are allogenic, not autologous, the patient
may also receive immunosuppressive therapy for several months and sometimes for years after
transplant, depending on the degree of incompatibility between the host and donor cells.
Allo-HSCT has potential complications, including risks for transplant-related mortality, graft failure,
graft-versus-host disease, and infection. These risks are decreased in patients who have a human
leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor; which fewer than 30% of patients have. Current treatment
options for those without an HLA-matched sibling donor include allo-HSCT with cells derived from an
HLA-mismatched related donor or from a matched or mismatched unrelated donor, including banked

infectious disease markers may be performed to rule in or out persisting infection. The infectious
disease testing strategy to determine acceptance of HPC-A is sufficiently described and deemed
acceptable.
A brief description of the HPC-A collection process is provided. Collection of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is performed following standard operating procedures. The apheresis
collection devices and kits are specified, and CE-declarations of conformity are provided.
The HPC-A from a single mobilisation cycle is used to support production of one batch of finished
product. If necessary, an additional mobilisation cycle may be subsequently completed following a pre-
defined time interval to collect additional cells that will support manufacture of a supplemental finished
product batch to achieve the finished product patient dose.
Characterisation data for HPC-A material used in the manufacturing of batches used in the clinical
development (studies ALD-102 and ALD-104) are provided.
The shipping system for HPC-A has been qualified using a risk-based approach through both
Operational Qualification (OQ, performed by both the vendor and by the applicant) and Performance
Qualification (PQ). In addition, shipping qualification studies were performed for worst-case simulated
conditions, including atmospheric condition, shock (dropping) and vibration test regimes posed upon
HPC-A samples.
Raw materials
Perview of the law mate used in the active sync eles
An overview of the raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process is presented,
including representative CoAs or certificates of conformance (CoCs). In general, the provided
information demonstrates appropriate quality of the raw materials.
Transfer pack containers and cell culture bags of varying sizes, tubing and cell separation kits used in
the active substance production are sterilised and single use. Representative certificates of analysis are
provided. Based on a risk assessment, an extractable study was performed for the cell processor kit
and the cell culture bag. No safety concern was identified.
Control of critical steps and intermediates (transduced autologous cells)
An overview of the IPCs and their action limits included in the active substance manufacturing process
is provided. Furthermore, according to the description of the manufacturing process, additional
sampling is included after each step.
The limits of the currently proposed IPCs are considered sufficiently justified.
Process validation
As the manufacturing process of Skysona is continuous, process validation is discussed in the finished
proche aldat Venty step. The description of the manufacturing process, adott
Manufacturing process development (transduced autologous cells)
The description of eli-cel active substance manufacturing process development includes an overview of
the manufacturing process history that describes changes introduced during clinical development and
compares clinical manufacturing results across multiple manufacturing sites, an overview of the
approaches employed for process design and development with justifications for the use of healthy
donor cell HPC-A and scale-down models, results from process characterisation studies, and a process
control strategy (PCS) summary for the commercial manufacturing process.

Overall, the same manufacturing process has been used throughout the eli-cel active substance
manufacturing process history, although minor process improvements were made as additional
knowledge was gained.
Comparability
Throughout development, clinical trial materials were manufactured at several sites. During process
transfer between sites and upon defining the commercial process, minor sequential adjustments of the
process were made. A site-to-site comparison was conducted with eli-cel material from the
manufacturing sites used during clinical development. The strategy is considered adequate.
The analytical approach includes a classification of attributes based on their potential impact to product
quality, safety or efficacy and corresponding development of acceptance criteria following a risk-based
approach. The risk classification is clearly described and considered adequate.
The data provided support comparability between sites.
Process development studies
Process development studies (process characterisation and PPQ) were conducted using surrogate cells.
Results are provided to show that data generated with surrogate cells (at-scale engineering run data)
can be extrapolated to product obtained from CALD patients. Justification of the use of surrogate cells
in development studies is based on a comparison of in process and final product attributes of
engineering batches with data from clinical batches. Data provided support the use of surrogate cells
as model for patient cells.
A scale-down model was developed to enable design of experiment (DoE) studies for both process
development and characterisation studies.
An evaluation of the eli-cel quality attributes was conducted following quality risk management
principles. The risk-based approach used to assess the criticality of each quality attribute included an
evaluation of the severity of impact and the uncertainty of knowledge with regards to its clinical
impact. Quality attributes related to safety, identity, strength, potency, purity, process-related
impurities, LVV-related impurities and general attributes have been addressed.
Process parameters were assessed for potential impact to quality attributes. Individual parameters
were assigned a risk score based on severity, occurrence and detection, using a Failure Mode and
Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach. Parameters with a risk score above a pre-established threshold were
designated for further process characterisation. This results in a selection of process parameters for
further evaluation using DOE, one factor at a time, or a combination of both approaches at different
scales. The provided summaries of the process characterisation, although brief, are considered
sufficient to assess the impact of process parameters on study output attributes and consequently to
support the proposed parameter classification and PARS.
Characterisation (transduced autologous cells)
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics
Characterisation studies were performed on retains from eli-cel batches used in clinical studies.
Multiple attributes and correlations were analysed including VCN of all cells and colony-forming-cells,
the percentage of cells with integrating transgene and the percentage of LVV+ eli-cel colonies,
percentage of eli-cel cells expressing ALDP and its functional impact, retention of the capability to form
colonies as well as phenotypic cellular composition. State-of-the-art-methods were applied and the
results confirmed the expected quality attributes.
VCN
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 22/136

which according to the applicant was the maximal feasible dose based on the number of cells available
and cell concentration/allowable dose volumes. The dose represents an 8-fold multiple of the minimum
dose of Lenti-D Drug Product for patients with CALD (≥5x106 CD34+ cells/kg). The VCN were within
the clinical range.
IV administration of Lenti-D LVV-transduced human autologous CD34+ HSCs to myeloablated patients
with CALD is hypothesised to result in initial distribution to most tissues via the circulatory system.
Indeed PCR analysis detected human DNA sequences (Hu-hck1) and Lenti-D viral DNA sequences (Psi-
gag) in all tissues tested (bone-marrow, brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, ovaries, skeletal
muscle, spleen and testes) which remained throughout the 3-month study period. For human
sequences (Hu-hck1) and Lenti-D viral sequences (Psi-gag), the highest concentration (copies/ug) was
observed in bone-marrow were signals above the upper LoQ were observed. Medium to high
concentrations were observed in lung, liver and spleen whereas medium concentrations were detected
in heart and kidney. Lower concentrations were seen in brain, intestine and muscle.
Following engraftment in bone-marrow, the cells are believed to differentiate further into various cell
types. Also, some HSCs are thought to be able to engraft directly with certain tissues such as the
brain. The hypothesised mode of action of Lenti-D Drug Product requires transduced HSCs to
differentiate into microglia-like cells expressing ALDP and engraft and persist within the brain. Studies
on the distribution of the transduced cells to the brain are therefore regarded key for supporting the
proposed mechanism of action. The biodistribution data in immune incompetent mice are considered to
support Lenti-D LVV transduced CD34+ HSC engraftment and persistence in bone-marrow and the
brain. It should however be noted that human DNA signals in brain were very low and ALDP production
in brain could not be demonstrated.
Overall, these results could lend support to the notion that Lenti-D Drug Product can distribute to brain
and persist as microglia-like cells in CALD patients.
Germ line transmission studies
vivo with a reputation-incompeten Studies C
No dedicated germline transmission studies have been conducted. Given that the cells are transduced
ex vivo with a replication-incompetent vector and no residual free viral particles are present in the
Lenti-D Drug Product, the risk for germ line transmission is considered regarded very limited and
rather theoretical. Also, patients will be preconditioned with the reprotoxic busulfan, often resulting in
infertility. The omission of specific germ line transmission studies is therefore acceptable.
2.3.3. Toxicology
The non-clinical safety programme conducted with Lenti-D LVV transduced human CD34+ HCSs
consists of two single-dose toxicology studies performed in NSG and NSGS immune-incompetent mice.
Since Lenti-D LVV will integrate in the genome, the potential for insertional site mutagenesis to induce
transformative changes was investigated in murine lineage-negative (Lin-) bone marrow cells (BMCs).
Furthermore Lenti-D LVV integration patterns in healthy human CD34+ cells were analysed by
integration site analysis (ISA).
No repeat-dose toxicology, dedicated carcinogenicity, juvenile or developmental and reproductive
toxicology studies were performed, and their omission is acceptable considering the nature of the
product.
Relevance of animal models
Lenti-D LVV is a single-dose autologous cell therapy. If human cells are administered to immune-
competent animals, they will be rejected. Therefore immune-incompetent mice strains were used.
Since mice (including immune-incompetent mice) do not provide optimal physiological conditions for
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 31/136
promoting survival and function of human cells, the relevance of the non-clinical in vivo model, in
particular for predicting risk of toxicity and cancer development in humans, is considered limited. NSG
mice lack mature T or B cells, functional NK cells, and cytokine signaling and predominately promote
development of lymphoid cells. NSGS mice, in comparison to NSG mice, also express human cytokines
(IL-3, GM-CSF and SF) promoting differentiation of myeloid cells. Although the value of using immune-
incompetent mice to predict safety issues for a human cell therapy is questionable, the strains have
been used as a model for HSC engraftment and their use can from that point be justified.
Single-dose toxicity
The toxicity of Lenti-D LVV transduced human CD34+ cells were evaluated in two separate single-dose
studies, both in immune-incompetent mice. One study was GLP compliant and used NSG mice and the
other study was an investigative study and used both NSG and NSGS mice that received busulfan to
induce myeloablation and facilitate HSC engraftment in bone marrow.
In the GLP study (NC-12-007), cells were well-tolerated in NSG mice over the 3-months study period.
Comparable engraftment of cells was seen in mock and Lenti-D LVV transduced cells. The toxic effects
of busulfan makes it difficult to pinpoint Lenti-D LVV-related toxicity. That given, there were no Lenti-D
LVV-related adverse effects on clinical signs, body weights or clinical pathology parameters. A NOAEL
of 40×106 cells/kg (8X margin) is therefore acceptable.
In the investigative study B1-13-003 using both NSG and NSGS mice, the only toxicological
parameters investigated were clinical signs, body weights, haematology, serum chemistry (only
phosphorous) and organ weights (brain and tibias only). All animals survived throughout the study but
from week 10, cells (both mock and Lenti D cells) were not well-tolerated by NSGS mice and signs of
myeloid-driven bone-marrow dysfunction were present (weight loss, abnormal clinical signs, decreased
platelets, immature blood cells). This was most likely due to the transgenic expression of human
myelosupportive cytokines (IL-3, GM-CSF and SF) in NSGS mice that promotes a biased engraftment
and differentiation of myeloid cells and leading to myeloid-driven bone marrow dysfunction.
C
Again, the Lenti-D LVV transduced cells were overall well-tolerated by NSG mice. Similar to the results
from the GLP-study there were no clinical observations. A decrease in body weight change (-30%, 0-3
months) and a slight decrease in body weight was observed in animals receiving Lenti-D LVV
transduced cells. The decrease was more pronounced between week 10 and 13 (-52,9%). Platelet
counts were decreased in Lenti-D treated animals (-51%). The relevance of the weight and platelet
findings are unclear since no clear body weight effects or decreased platelets were seen in the GLP
study.

A bioassay was intended for the confirmation of RCL. Since all samples were negative at screening, this
assay was not used for samples included in this MAA.
Integration site analysis (ISA)
ISA determines patterns of integration of Lenti-D LVV in gDNA from peripheral blood of subjects
treated with eli-cel and identifies the relative contribution of individual IS over time to define an
increase or decrease in the contribution of individual IS. ISA was based on two published methods
(Schmidt et al. 2001, 2007) and performed as a qualified and validated method at GeneWerk
(Heidelberg, Germany).
From 2014 up to 31 May 2019, ISA was done by standard linear amplification PCR (LAM-PCR) and non-
restricted LAM-PCR (nrLAM-PCR); together referred to as [nr]LAM-PCR. [nr]LAMPCR was the assay of
choice in the early stages of our clinical studies because of its sensitivity in detecting low-abundance
integration sites (IS) in samples with a low VCN. However, the use of restriction enzymes in [nr]LAM-
PCR can introduce amplification biases that can result in inaccurate estimations of IS frequencies
(abundance).
dethorses
For [nr]LAM-PCR, peripheral blood gDNA was subjected to PCR using biotinylated primers that
hybridize to the 3'-region of the LTR of the vector. This was followed by magnetic capture of the
biotinylated PCR-products, double-strand DNA synthesis, restriction digestion as relevant, and addition
of linker adaptors containing a molecular barcode. The digested fragments were then subjected to
exponential PCR using nested vector- and adaptor-specific biotinylated primers. The PCR products were
then subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis to identity unique, mappable
integration sites and to determine their relative frequency amongst all IS. The data was then analysed
to determine whether predominant clones were present, with a semi-quantitative readout.
As of 01 June 2019, samples were analysed by shearing extension primer tag selection ligation-
mediated polymerase chain reaction (S-EPTS/LM-PCR). S-EPTS/LM-PCR substantially minimizes the
risk that individual IS may be masked, as may happen with [nr]LAM-PCR if the next restriction site is
very close in distance to the vector integrant and thus not able to be mapped to the host genome (S-
EPTS/LM-PCR Validation Report Summary, 24 June 2020).
For S-EPTS/LM-PCR, sheared gDNA was purified, and primer extension was performed using an LTR
specific biotinylated primer. The extension product was again purified, followed by magnetic capture of
the biotinylated DNA. The captured DNA was then ligated to linker cassettes, including a molecular
barcode and the ligation product amplified in the first exponential PCR, using biotinylated vector- and
linker-cassette-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR-product was magnetically captured and pooled.
The eluted product was used as template for a second exponential PCR and the product was purified
and subjected to deep sequencing by MiSeq technology (Illumina) followed by bioinformatics analysis
to identify unique, mappable integration sites. Positive controls in the validation were genomic DNA
from clone L2E9 bearing an integration site in RERE gene and clone L3D7 showing an integration site in
PTPN13 gene as well as genomic DNA derived from a polyclonal lentiviral vector-infected bulk
population. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, within and between run accuracy and
precision with acceptance criteria being CV ≤20%. The limit of detection was at a clonal distribution
0.05%, which corresponds to the detection of 34.09 RERE integration site copies within a pool of
68,181.8 integration sites.
Regardless of screening method used, a verification of Relative IS-Frequency of any IS identified as of
interest, according to protocol-defined criteria (e.g., detected at a frequency of > 30% at any
timepoint, or persistently > 10% in Study Protocol ALD-104 v4), is analysed further by qPCR using
customised IS-specific primers. Customised primers were designed for each IS of interest, and their
relative contribution to the overall vector copies in the sample, was determined by comparison with the
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 41/136
total number of vector sequences as determined by using primers specific for the psi-gag region of the
LVV.
Very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) method
Fasting serum VLCFA levels were quantified in subjects at screening and at pre-defined intervals post
eli-cel infusion, to monitor for changes. The validated method used capillary gas chromatography-
electron-capture negative-ion mass spectrometry of fatty acids, based the published method
(Lagerstedt et al. 2001). Levels of C26:0, C26:1, C24:0, C22:0 and C22:1 were determined, as well as
the ratios of C24:C22 and C26:22. No validation report was provided.
Conditioning, lymphodepletion and PK monitoring
Myeloablation of the subjects before drug product infusion is required to deplete endogenous HSCs,
thus allowing repopulation of the subject with HSCs containing the transgene without dilution due to
the presence of residual unablated cells. Current literature indicates that myeloablation is required for
effective reconstitution with transplanted HSCs; reduced intensity conditioning generally has shown
lower rates of donor cell reconstitution. The conditioning included lymphodepletion before Eli-Cel
infusion because CALD is associated with lymphocytic infiltration. Two different lymphodepletion
regimens were used; busulfan and cyclophosphamide in study ALD-102 or busulfan and fludarabine in
study ALD-104, which reflected clinical practice and the introduction of a less toxic conditioning
regimen. Regardless of conditioning regimen, sufficient lymphodepletion was achieved to allow eli-cel
treatment.
ALD-102
During conditioning, the target daily busulfan AUC range was 4250 to 5250 UM*min and in 26 out of
31 subjects busulfan AUC was within target range, as estimated by the cumulative busulfan exposure,
based on measured concentration from the first dose of subsequent dose if required. One subject was
excluded due to data entry error and the remaining 5 subjects had daily busulfan AUC's below the
target range. In order to clarify whether the conditioning was insufficient, the ratio of PB VCN at Month
6/DP VCN was plotted against estimated average busulfan AUC, denoting no apparent correlation.
ALD-104
During conditioning, the target busulfan AUC range was 5340 to 5964 UM*min/L/day and in 6 out of 13
subjects busulfan AUC was within target range. The remaining 7 subjects had daily busulfan AUC's
below the target range. In 6 of these subjects, busulfan doses were gradually increased following low
initial AUC values and subsequently AUC fell within target range. One subject with initial busulfan AUC
above target range fell below after dose adjustment. All subjects experienced effective myeloablation
and afterwards production of gene modified cells, also the seven patients who had busulfan daily
average AUC below target interval.
Special populations
No data is available in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. All patients were male, as the
disease affects predominantly males.
Eli-cel is dosed on the basis of the number of CD34+ cells per kg body weight, a practice that is
followed for bone marrow transplantation, including treatment using allo-HSCT for children who have
CALD. No correlation was observed between body weight and PB VCN or PB %ALDP+ cells. No dose
adjustments are required for overweight subjects.
Given the target population, no elderly were included in clinical trials with eli-cel.

However, optimal neutrophil and platelet engraftment has been reported to occur at doses around 5.0
× 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
To date, a total of 45 subjects (32 subjects in Study ALD-102 and 13 subjects in Study ALD-104) have
received doses of 5.0 to 38.2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, and the lack of correlation of cell dose with the
time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment suggests that even the lowest dose received (5.0 x 106
CD34+ cells/kg) is adequate for eli-cel to effectively reconstitute the haematopoietic system of
subjects. Thus ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is the recommended dose for eli-cel.
No upper dose limit is specified. For subject safety, only the minimum number of
mobilisation/apheresis cycles are performed to collect sufficient cells required for drug product
manufacturing to meet the minimum dose. Therefore, it is not practicable to determine a maximal
tolerable cell dose. To the applicant's knowledge, there is no maximum recommended dose of CD34+
cells for infusion of autologous cell products in the literature. Adverse events due to high CD34+ cell
dose have not been reported in studies with allo-HSCT or in eli-cel clinical studies.

2.5.2. Main study
Pivotal study ALD-102
Study ALD-102 is an international multi-site, non-randomised, open label, single-dose, single-arm,
prospective phase 2/3 study in male subjects with CALD treated with eli-cel.
The study is ongoing; it started in 2013 and the Interim study report with the Data cut-off: 17 January
2020 was produced for the Marketing authorisation application.
Methods
Study participants
Male subjects aged 17 years and younger with active cerebral ALD as defined by elevated VLCFA
values and active central nervous system (CNS) disease established by central radiographic review of

Gadolinium enhancement (GdE+) on MRI of demyelinating lesions. The neurologic function scale (NFS)
of ≤1. The main exclusion criterion was availability of a willing 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor
(excluding female heterozygotes).
Treatments
Mobilisation and Apheresis
Subjects were mobilised with G-CSF for 4 to 6 days.
Apheresis was performed per standard clinical site practice. Up to 3 total collections could be
performed as part of any one mobilisation cycle until the target of 12 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg was
obtained for transduction.
Conditioning
Pre-conditioning assessments were performed 11 days prior to eli-cel infusion (defined as Rel Day -11;
with a window of -3 days, i.e. Rel Day -14 through Rel Day -11) prior to myeloablative conditioning. If
neurological decline was observed, as evidenced by a NFS > 1 or a Loes Score > 9, the subject was
discontinued from the study.
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 51/136
Conditioning only began once eli-cel was dispositioned for clinical use and the drug product was at the
clinical site. Myeloablative and lymphodepleting conditioning was performed on an in-patient basis
using first busulfan IV followed by cyclophosphamide IV.
Weight-based dosing of busulfan IV was administered on Rel Days -10, -9, -8, and -7 and weight-
based dosing of cyclophosphamide IV was administered on Rel Days -5, -4, -3, and -2.
Eli-cell treatment
Infusion of eli-cel was given approximately 48 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide.
The dose administered was ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
Prohibited concomitant therapies
Medications used to lower VLCFA levels (e.g., Lorenzo's oil, statins) and other investigational therapies
were excluded during study participation. In addition, subjects were not to start a new low fat diet
during study participation. There were no other excluded concomitant medications or vaccines.
Objectives
The case at a level of cion that preserves theatment with the
for independent living for
subjects with CALD, i.e. that the patients didn't develop any major functional disabilities (MFDs).
The second objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of eli-cel in subjects with CALD.
Success criterion
cordance With Agency advice Velice
coucoulonger authorised
The objective of the current study was to demonstrate that treatment with eli-cel is able to stabilize
In accordance with prior Regulatory Agency advice, the success criterion for this study was based on a
comparison of the ALD-102 primary efficacy endpoint for the Initial Cohort to a clinically meaningful
benchmark, such that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact CI of Month 24 MFD-free survival
must be > 50% in order for the primary endpoint to be met.
This clinically meaningful benchmark of 50% is supported by the Study ALD-101 untreated study
population, who were GdE+ at any time, as well as data from the ALD-101 allo-HSCT treated
population, now published in the literature (Raymond et al., 2018). There is additional supportive
context from disease-specific literature that reports on overall survival rather than MFD-free survival
(Baumann et al., 2003; Beam et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2011; Peters et al., 2004). As patients can and
do progress through MFDs to death, the results of these studies can be further informative to this
benchmark. In Study ALD-101, the Month 24 MFD-free survival rate in untreated GdE+ subjects within
2 years of their first GdE+ MRI was 21% (exact 95% CIs of 6.1% to 45.6%). Thus, this benchmark
value is above the upper bound of the 95% CI of the Month 24 MFD-free survival in untreated subjects
Medicina
In Study ALD-101, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact CI of the Month 24 MFD-free survival
rate in GdE+, early disease (NFS≤1, Loes ≥0.5 and ≤9) subjects without a matched sibling donor and
treated with allo-HSCT was 50.1% (mean 76% with exact 95% CI of 50.1% to 93.2%).
An MFD-free survival rate at various timepoints ranging between approximately 50% to 90% is
reported in existing literature for patients with CALD treated with allo-HSCT. Peters et al. reported that
53.4% of subjects treated with early clinical disease had no neurological progression and remained
functional; the 5-year survival for subjects with 0 to 1 clinical symptoms at baseline was 67% to 70%
(Peters et al., 2004). Miller et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of 91% (95% CI 69% to 98%) for
patients with a baseline NFS of 0, and 89% (95% CI 70% to 96%) for patients with a baseline Loes
score <10. The follow-up median NFS for both cohorts was 0, with an interquartile range of 0 to 0
(NFS of 0) and 0 to 1 (Loes score <10) (Miller et al., 2011). Both of these studies included subjects

The study success criterion for efficacy: Month 24 MFD-free survival
Success criterion for efficacy was based upon having a lower 95% CI of > 50.0% for the endpoint of
Month 24 MFD-free survival for the Initial Cohort. This was based on comparison of the primary
efficacy endpoint results for the Initial Cohort TP (N = 17) to a clinically meaningful benchmark.

d In sensitivity analysis, only death and MFDs are considered failures.
Initial Cohort
In the Initial Cohort, 15/17 or 88.2 % (95% CI 63.6, 98.5) of subjects infused with eli-cel met the
primary endpoint (Month 24 MFD-free survival).
Because the lower bound (63.6%) is above the threshold of 50%, the study efficacy success criterion
was met.
In the Initial Cohort, 2/17 subjects failed to achieve the primary endpoint:
One subject developed 4 MFDs (total incontinence at month 9, cortical blindness and loss of
communication at month 12, and wheelchair dependence at month 21). This subject subsequently died
at month 21 from disease progression.
Another subject did not develop any MFDs but was withdrawn from the study at month 13 post-
treatment to undergo an allo-HSCT due to increased Loes score (+7), NFS (+1) and re-emergence of
contrast enhancement on MRI (GdE+). At Baseline, this subject had a Loes score of 2.0, NFS of 0, was
GdE+, and had a Loes Pattern 3 (associated with slower progression). At last evaluation in Study ALD-
102 before allo-HSCT, he had a Loes Score of 9.0, NFS of 1, was GdE+, and had Loes Pattern 2
(associated with faster progression). Both subjects were treated at the same site, this subject was

Study ALD-104, and subjects who receive allo-HSCT in Studies ALD-101 and ALD-103, is abbreviated
as TP-102, TP-104, TP-101, and TP-103, respectively.
The Successful Neutrophil Engraftment Population (NEP) consists of subjects who achieved neutrophil
engraftment defined as having 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil count (ANC) laboratory values of ≥
0.5 x 109 cells/L (after initial post-infusion nadir) obtained on different days by 42 days post-infusion
of HSC. The NEP was used to compare hospitalisation after a successful NE from either Lenti-D Drug
Product or allo-HSCT, only if the NEP is different from the TP.
Three baseline parameters, NFS, Loes score, and gadolinium enhancement (GdE) status, are important
prognostic factors for CALD disease progression in untreated patients. Therefore, efficacy and safety
results in TP-102 and TP-104 were compared with populations in Studies ALD-101 and ALD-103 with
"similar" baseline disease characteristics with respect to these three parameters.

and the results appear similar between TP-102 and TPES-103. Generally, median values stayed near
Baseline. There is more variability in the median Performance IQ over time for TPES-103, presumably
due to the smaller number of subjects; the median Performance IQ dips below the normal range at

2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy
adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for
whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not
available (see section 5.1).'
The proposed indication is agreed upon.
It is concluded that although all patients in the clinical studies were males, a gender-neutral indication
text is preferred to allow treatment also in rare cases of female childhood CALD patients. The SmPC
includes the information in section 4.2 that female paediatric patients have not been included in the
clinical studies.
In support of this indication, efficacy results from one pivotal study (ALD-102, N=32) and one ongoing
long-term follow-up study (LTF-304) with subjects with CALD treated with eli-cel have been submitted.
In addition, a second treatment study ALD-104 is ongoing but hadn't reached the cut-off timepoint for
the primary efficacy endpoint at the time of approval.
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 91/136
As historical control groups, the retrospective study ALD-101 contains both untreated boys and boys
treated with allo-HSCT and study ALD-103 is a contemporaneous study with boys treated with allo-
HSCT. For long-term follow up of efficacy and safety, the ongoing LTF-304 study will contain all boys
who were treated with eli-cel in the clinical studies. A planned registry will enrol boys treated with eli-
cel post-approval or allo-HSCT.
Single-arm design of the studies with no comparator is an important limitation of the clinical
development programme. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a
therapeutic option that can stabilise progression of CALD, with the best outcomes observed if it is
performed at the early stages of cerebral involvement. The severity of the disease, the rarity of the
disease, the limitations of treatment options, the inability of transplant to be blinded, and the potential
impact of time required to identify a donor match on cerebral disease progression precluded the
conduct of a randomised controlled trial in the target patient population, this is acceptable and agreed
during scientific advice given.
Dose-response
No dose-response studies have been performed, which is acceptable given the rarity and severity of
the disease.
The applicant states that the minimum proposed dose of ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg eli-cel is the
minimal dose that has been reported to lead to optimal neutrophil and platelet engraftment.
Furthermore, there are no maximal recommended dose of CD34+ cells for infusion and no AEs related
to high CD34+ cell doses have been reported in the literature. However, in line with Zynteglo, the
Skysona SmPC 4.2 states that 'In clinical studies doses up to 38.2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg have been
administered'. This is supported.
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Pivotal study ALD-102
The main inclusion criteria were male 17 and younger with active CALD defined by elevated VLCFA
values, Loes scores 0.5 to 9 on MRI, GdE+, NFS≤1. It is noted that a genetic diagnosis of ALD was not
included in the inclusion criteria. However, the demographics data on individual subjects confirm that a
genetic diagnosis based on detection of an ABCD1 gene mutation had been performed for all included
subjects. The genetic diagnosis is also included in the proposed Indication text, which is endorsed. The
inclusion criteria related to early disease (Loes score, GdE+ and NFS) reflect the experience from allo-
HSCT treatment of early CALD and are acknowledged.
Main exclusion criterion was availability of a willing 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor. This exclusion
criterion is reflected in the last sentence of the proposed Indication: " ... for whom a human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not available".
criterion is reflect tento Year
The applicant states that the conditioning regimen used in this study, busulfan and cyclophosphamide,
is a standard regimen used in allo-HSCT for CALD to achieve myeloablation and immunosuppression.
The conditioning regimen is described in SmPC section 5.1.
The success criterion for study ALD-102 comparison to a clinically meaningful benchmark, has been
accepted at scientific advice given. The efficacy results are also compared to the untreated cohort in
ALD-101 and the allo-HSCT treated cohorts of studies ALD-101 and ALD-103.
The major endpoints MFD-free survival, NFS, Loes score have been specifically developed for CALD
studies to represent outcomes that are clinically relevant in this condition. The selection of endpoints is
in accordance with published results from successful trials using allo-HSCT to treat CALD. The primary
and secondary endpoints were accepted in the EMA Central Scientific advice of 2018.

No primary or secondary NE failure was observed in evaluable TP-102/104 subjects. Two subjects from
Study ALD-104 were considered unevaluable for NE because they had not yet achieved NE or been
followed until at least Rel Day 43.
Primary or secondary NE failure was experienced by 10/38 (26.3%) evaluable subjects by Month 24 in
TP-103, all of whom were NMSD subjects. Six of these subjects had primary engraftment failure and 4
subjects had secondary engraftment failure. Nine of these subjects went on to receive second allo-
HSCTs, and 1 subject underwent a third allo-HSCT after experiencing primary engraftment failure after
both first and second allo-HSCTs.

It was explored post-hoc whether changes in standard of care in allo-HSCT treated subjects over time
had impacted the rates of NE failure in this population. However, 6 of 13 (46.2%) evaluable subjects
treated after June 30, 2016 in the TP-103 population experienced primary or secondary engraftment
failure by Month 24, ie a higher rate than in the overall TP-103 population (10/38 [26.3%]. These
subjects all had no matched sibling donor.
In TP-102/104, updated safety information shows all evaluable subjects (47/47 [100%]) had
successful PE, with a median (min, max) PE on Rel Day 32 (14, 108). Four subjects from Study ALD-
104 were considered unevaluable for PE because they had not yet achieved PE or been followed for at
least 24 months.
In TP-103, 12 of 59 subjects were not considered evaluable for PE by Month 24 because they had
primary or secondary engraftment failure or died. The 47 evaluable subjects all had successful PE, with
median (min, max) PE occurring on Rel Day 26 (13, 67).
Additional and updated analyses that also include all treated patients and time to event methodology
showed consistent results (see Table below).

In TP-102/104, 27/45 (60%) subjects experienced 63 TESAEs from D1 through Last Follow-up. the
overall SAE profile was largely consistent with the effects of conditioning. The most frequently
experienced TESAEs were related to Blood and lymphatic system disorders (12/45 [26.7%]), General
disorders and administration site conditions (10/45 [22.2%]), Infections and infestations (7/45
[15.6%]), and Gastrointestinal disorders (5/45 [11.1%]).
Three subjects had SAEs that were considered possibly related to Skysona.
Two of the SAEs that were assessed by the Investigator to be possibly related to Skysona were the
events of pancytopenia previously discussed (from study ALD-104).
In study ALD-102, one SAE, an event of Cystitis viral (Grade 3), was assessed by the Investigator as
possibly related to Skysona. This subject (with a medical history of adrenal insufficiency), was
diagnosed with BK virus haemorrhagic cystitis on Rel Day 44 and fully recovered following
symptomatic treatment. Overall, a causal relationship to Skysona seems unlikely.
All TESAEs resolved with the exception of the SAEs ongoing at the time of death in one subject, the
SAEs of pancytopenia in two subjects. Updated narratives reported that both events of pancytopenia
are not resolved. One of the subjects was treated with immunosuppressants with no response. Both
subjects were clinically stable with no need for platelet transfusions or eltrombopag but still had below-
normal platelet levels.
The reported cases of pancytopenia are reflected in the SmPC.
In addition, there is an ongoing SAE of Grade 3 myelitis transverse in one subject. The event was
considered not or unlikely related to Skysona by the investigator. The aetiology remains unclear but
there was no evidence of an immunogenic reaction.
The proportion of subjects with serious infections was more than 2-fold higher in TP-103 than in TP-
102/104 (22/59 [37.3%] vs 7/45 [15.6%], respectively), and the number of serious infections was
more than 5-fold higher (47 events vs 8 events, respectively). Many serious infections in TP-103 were
opportunistic (14 SAEs), reflective of the subjects' chronically immunocompromised state, while 1
serious opportunistic infection was reported in TP-102/104 (Cystitis viral). The majority of TESAE
infections (38/47 events) in TP-103 were in 16 subjects in the NMSD subgroup.
There were no TESAEs reported in the Vascular disorders SOC for TP-102/104; however, 7/59 (11.9%)
subjects in TP-103 experienced 8 TESAEs in this SOC, with 6 of these 7 subjects in the NMSD
subgroup. Two subjects had serious events of hypertension, a known consequence of
immunosuppressants, and 4 subjects had 4 events that were thrombotic (e.g., cerebral infarction,
deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis, and veno-occlusive disease), which may be linked the endothelial
effects of immunosuppression.
Two subjects in TP-103 experienced 3 TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator. One
NMSD subject experienced a TESAE of Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and an MSD subject
experienced 2 TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator, haemolytic anaemia and
encephalopathy.

Note: PTs (and their associated SOC) are included for all SAEs that were observed in the D1 to M48 study period
and are sorted based on decreasing frequency by SOC and then PT (and then alphabetically) based on TP-103
overall. Subjects at risk for each period (N in column header) is defined to be the subjects who entered the study
period. If event started in one reporting period and continued into the next reporting period, it was counted only in
the first period. If event started and stopped in one reporting period and then recurred in the next reporting period,
it was counted in both periods. Subjects were counted once for each SOC and PT even if they had multiple instances
of the event in one period. For SAEs with worsening severity in which the AE started in the first period and
worsened in the next period, the subject was counted in both periods. All events reported in the database are
counted in the number of events.
In the out
In the ongoing study LTF-304, 7 SAEs in 4 subjects were reported in the initial MAA: 3 SAEs of seizure,
and 1 each of fatigue, depression, suicidal ideation, and pyrexia. None of the SAEs was considered
related to Skysona.
Five additional subjects reported new TESAEs have been reported since the initial MAA data cuts, 3
subjects from the ongoing Study ALD-104 and 2 subjects in the ongoing Study LTF-304 (originally
enrolled in ALD-102). The cases in Study ALD-104 referred to Pseudomonal bacteraemia (attributed to
conditioning), Pyrexia (attributed to catheter removal) and febrile neutropenia (attributed to
conditioning). All events resolved. In Study LTF-304, there were 2 SAEs of seizure, not considered
related to Skysona.

3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1. Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
The sought indication is: 'Skysona is indicated for the treatment of early cerebral
adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for
whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not
available (see section 5.1).'
Authorised
The target population is paediatric patients with CALD. In the clinical studies, males 4-14 years have
been treated with Skysona. In addition, a few female cases have been described in the literature, and
these are believed to have the same disease characteristics as the males, and thus the indication
should include both sexes. The typical age for onset of MRI signs of demyelinisation and development
of cerebral symptoms is 2-12 years, but there are rare cases with onset in children as young as 1 year
and also in adolescents with the same disease characteristics as in children. Thus, patients younger
than 3 years of age have not yet been treated with eli-cel, however, it is clear from literature on
allogeneic and autologous transplantation that patients can effectively and safely undergo the required
apheresis, conditioning, and infusion from the age of 6 months. In addition, data from 3 subjects ≤3
years of age in Study ALD-103 revealed prompt neutrophil engraftment with MFD-free survival at
Month 24. No lower age cut-off for the Indication is needed since the clinical diagnosis of CALD
including MRI detection of demyelination and neurologic function tests is age-limiting in itself. No child
with a diagnosis of early CALD and without an available matched sibling donor should be excluded from
treatment. As newborn screening becomes more available and earlier diagnosis of cerebral
manifestations is possible, these patients will benefit from neurologic disease stabilisation at the
earliest signs of brain damage. For the upper age cut-off, it is considered that adolescents have the
same disease characteristics as children, whereas the rare adult patients with CALD have somewhat
different disease characteristics, often with psychiatric problems, and CALD in adults may be
superimposed on adrenomyeloneuropathy. Adults have not been included in the studied population.
Thus, it is considered that the upper age cut-off of less than 18 years is appropriate. In summary, it is
considered that efficacy may be extrapolated from the studied population to the intended target
population.
MFD-free survival, a direct clinical observation of neurologic function, shows a compelling effect of eli-
cel, with clinically meaningful results. NFS and neuropsychological testing, additional direct clinical
observations of neurologic functions, show that most patients have minimal to no functional or
cognitive decline, consistent with stabilisation of neurologic disease. MRI imaging biomarkers (Loes
scores) reinforce these clinical observations.
A variability of efficacy has been noted in the comparison of subgroups with higher or lower Loes score
than 4.5 at baseline. The few (n=4) subjects with a baseline Loes score ≥ 4.5 had a greater worsening
of Loes score (+7.5, vs +1.0) and Performance IQ (-23 vs -2.5) from baseline to month 24 than
subjects with a baseline Loes score of <4.5 (n=28). A sentence is included in the SmPC 5.1 to inform
Skysona - Assessment report
EMA/332184/2021
Page 131/136
the physician that patients with a higher MRI disease burden in terms of demyelination (and measured
as Loes scores) tend to have a less favourable outcome. However, it is considered that the benefit-risk
balance is positive for the entire studied patient population.
The primary endpoint MFD-free survival is considered a clinically relevant endpoint to capture survival
without development of major disabilities arising from the rapid progression of cerebral demyelination.
Given the poor prognosis in untreated CALD, eli-cel treatment is clearly superior to no treatment. In
addition, the Month 24-MFD-free survival after eli-cel appears slightly superior than after allo-HSCT
without a matched sibling donor (i.e. the NMSD subgroup of study ALD-103) and similar to that of allo-
HSCT with a matched sibling donor (i.e. the MSD subgroup of study ALD-103).
After allo-HSCT, even when the donor is a matched sibling donor, there is a risk of engraftment failure
and acute or chronic GvHD, which led to a decrease in the month 36 overall survival for the allo-HSCT
MSD subgroup due to immunity-related death (chronic GvHD in at least one subject). Accordingly, eli-
cel seems to offer a clinically meaningful advantage over allo-HSCT. For the subgroup of patients who
do not have an available matched sibling donor (NMSD), i.e. the intended target population for
Skysona, eli-cel offers a clear advantage in terms of MFD-free survival up to month 48 after treatment
with an MFD-free survival of 90% for eli-cel and 59% for the allo-HSCT subgroup NMSD.
In addition to MFD-free survival data, neuropsychological data show a stabilisation of performance IQ
for the majority of treated subjects, which shows that cognitive functions are preserved. The
neuropsychological test results add to the whole picture of disease stabilisation after treatment for the
majority of the patients. Clinical benefits are supported by pharmacodynamic endpoints showing the
presence of integrated vector sequences (vector copy number, VCN) and the expression of the
transgene (%ALDP+ cells), showing persistence of transduced haematopoietic stem cells over many
years. Disease stabilisation is not immediate, but rather happens approximately one to two years after
treatment, consistent with observations from allo-HSCT.
In summary, results for the primary endpoint MFD-free survival at month 24 have been provided for
30 Skysona-treated patients from the pivotal study ALD-102, exceeding the pre-specified benchmark
for untreated patients and in line with the results from studies ALD-101 and ALD-103 on allo-HSCT
treated patients with a matched sibling donor. In addition, performance IQ data show that cognitive
functions are preserved in the majority of treated patients.
The effect is durable for up to 5-6 years, as shown by sustained MFD-free survival, stable NFS and
cognition over time over follow up. At the latest data cut-off, 51 subjects have been followed for a
median (min, max) 29.11 (0.1, 82.7) months. In the pivotal study ALD-102 followed by the long-term
follow up study LTE-304, the median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 38.59 (13.4, 82.7) months.
Nearly half of subjects (20/51) have been followed for at least 3 years, with 11 subjects followed for at
least 5 years!
It is concluded that the efficacy results are considered sufficiently characterised for a full approval of
the sought indication, which excludes patients with an available matched sibling donor (MSD).
Safety
Similar to allo-HSCT, treatment with eli-cel is preceded by significant procedural and medical
interventions, including haematopoietic stem cell collection and myeloablative conditioning. Thus, in
general, these risks of eli-cel are expected to be in line with the safety profile known to be associated
with these procedures, and be reflected in the SmPC, including a description of which conditioning
regimen was used in the pivotal study ALD-102. However, given that eli-cel consists of autologous
transduced cells, this treatment compares favourably over allo-HSCT for subjects without a matched
sibling donor.
