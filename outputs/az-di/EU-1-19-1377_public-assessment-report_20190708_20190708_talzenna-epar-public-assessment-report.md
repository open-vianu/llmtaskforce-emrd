Deleterious gBRCA mutations increase the risk of breast (and ovarian) cancer through homologous repair
deficiency which develops as a consequence of haplo-insufficiency or locus-specific loss of heterozygosity, i.e.
the wild type BRCA allele is no longer sufficiently active to achieve homologous repair of DNA breaks.
gBRCA may be known in the individual patient prior to the onset of cancer of the breast or ovary, but the cancer
may manifest itself in ways not different from non-BRCA related disease.
2.1.4. Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging, and confirmed by
pathological assessment. Disease stage is assessed according to the TNM system10.
Well-known prognostic and predictive factors for breast cancer include hormone receptor and HER2 expression.
Estrogen receptor-negative, PgR-negative, HER2-negative tumours, known as TNBC, are associated with a poor
prognosis.
Metastatic TNBC has the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, with a median PFS of 3 to 5 months and
a median overall survival of <12 months with currently available therapies11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
2.1.5. Management
Prophylactic surgery in gBRCA carriers is one way to reduce the lifetime risk of cancer.
The choice of treatment is informed by tumour receptor and HER2 status at the time of initiation, as tumour
characteristics can evolve over time. A variety of treatments are approved or recommended for hormone
receptor-positive HER2-negative disease and TNBC without specification of BRCA mutation status.
Initial therapy of gBRCA positive breast cancer still follows the standards of therapy in breast cancer, but early
treatment with platinum compounds in e.g. triple negative breast cancer has emerged as an alternative in the
standard of care in the present decade. The results of the olaparib, another PARPi, study in recurrent HER2
negative, gBRCA positive breast cancer has influenced clinical practice16.
Treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer is palliative and the aim of the treatment is to
reduce symptoms and prolong life with preservation of quality of life. Treatment of advanced or metastatic
breast cancer can include surgery, radiotherapy, interventional radiology and systemic palliative treatment with
number of different anti-neoplastic agents including anti-hormonal drugs, biologicals, targeted treatments and
cytotoxic agents. In case of palliative treatment, the use of systemic treatments is generally sequential, mainly
monotherapy, based on patient characteristics, patient previous medical history, previous treatments, disease
biology, disease burden and both the patient and physician preferences and experience.

For patients with progressive germline BRCA mutated, HER2 negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast
cancer and indication for new anti-neoplastic treatment, after exhaustion of anti-hormonal agents and
anti-CDK4/6 agents if indicated, treatment with PARP inhibitors or next line palliative chemotherapy, including
capecitabine, eribulin and platinum containing cytotoxic agents, can be considered as next treatment
option 10,17.
Regardless of the available treatment options, the disease condition remains incurable with limited life
expectancy and near continuous need for palliative systemic treatment with the side effects that generally follow
cytotoxic treatments, including fatigue and general health deterioration, and intermittently progressive disease
with increasing disease related symptoms. There is an unmet medical need for patients with advanced or
metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer.
About the product
Talazoparib (PF-06944076, formerly BMN 673 or MDV3800) is a PARP inhibitor. The chemical name of
talazoparib free base is (8S,9R)
5-fluoro-8-(4-fluorophenyl)-9-(1-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2, 7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrido[4,3,2-de]phthal
azin-3-one. Talazoparib is provided as the 4 methyl-benzenesulfonate (tosylate) salt.
Talazoparib is an inhibitor of PARP enzymes, PARP1, and PARP2. PARP enzymes are involved in cellular DNA
damage response signalling pathways such as DNA repair, gene transcription, and cell death. PARP inhibitors
(PARPi) exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cells by 2 mechanisms, inhibition of PARP catalytic activity and by PARP
trapping, whereby PARP protein bound to a PARPi does not readily dissociate from a DNA lesion, thus preventing
DNA repair, replication, and transcription, thereby resulting in apoptosis and/or cell death. Treatment of cancer
cell lines that are harbouring defects in DNA repair genes with talazoparib single agent leads to increased levels
of yH2AX, a marker of double stranded DNA breaks, and results in decreased cell proliferation and increased
apoptosis. Talazoparib anti-tumour activity was also observed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) BRCA
mutant breast cancer model where the patient was previously treated with a platinum-based regimen. In this
PDX model talazoparib decreased tumour growth and increased yH2AX level and apoptosis in the tumours (see
SmPC section 5.1).
The applicant applied for the following indication: Talzenna is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
The recommended indication is as follows: Talzenna is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult
patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations, who have HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast
cancer. Patients should have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the
(neo) adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments
(see section 5.1). Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer should have been treated with a
prior endocrine-based therapy, or be considered unsuitable for endocrine-based therapy.
The recommended dose is 1 mg talazoparib once daily. Patients should be treated until disease progression or
unacceptable toxicity occurs.
Talzenna is available as hard capsules (0.25 mg and 1 mg).

a. IC50 is means + standard deviation
b. The PARP trapping fold at the approximate PARylation was determined by normalizing to Histone H3 and then
drug treatment trapping was divided by no drug control.
Multiparametric DDR assays in the BRCA2 mutated DU145 prostate cancer cell line were conducted using a
range of clinically relevant talazoparib concentrations in the presence and absence of the DNA alkylating agent
temozolomide (TMZ), which is used as a tool to further evaluate the functional effects of talazoparib (see Table
10).

2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics
Introduction
Eight clinical studies were submitted (see Table 20). The single dose food effect study has been performed in
healthy volunteers, whereas all other clinical pharmacology data were collected in patients with advanced
cancer. There were also two ongoing studies, in hepatic impairment (Study No MDV3800-02) and in renal
impairment (Study No MDV3800-01).
A population PK analysis, an exposure-response (progression-free survival as well as haematological toxicity) as
well as QTc modelling was also provided.
A full in vitro package characterising in vitro metabolism, transport, protein binding as well as potential to inhibit
or induce enzymes or transporters was also provided.
Methods
Plasma and urine concentrations of talazoparib were determined with LC-MS/MS methods and the
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with standard non-compartmental analysis.
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed, using data from the two phase I studies PRP-001 (rich
sampling) and PRP-002 (rich sampling), the phase 2 study 673- 201 (sparse sampling) and the phase 3 study
673-301 (sparse sampling). PK data from 490 patients who received dose levels from 0.25 to 2 mg once daily,
were included in the final population pharmacokinetic analysis. A linear two-compartment model with first-order
absorption and a lag time for absorption was used. Covariate effects included in the final model were age, race

a. Inhibition observed (%) = 100% - Percent solvent control at 10 uM talazoparib.
b. Potential for TDI and MDI was determined by comparison of IC50 values both with and without preincubation and with and without NADPH-generating system present. In the
cases where a number is listed, this number represents the fold shift of the IC50 value to a lower number after preincubation.
In vitro UGT inhibition (Study PF-06944076_18Aug17 035822)
The potential of talazoparib to inhibit the catalytic activity of 6 major human UGT enzymes was evaluated in
UDPGA supplemented pooled human liver microsomes with and without 2% BSA and specific UGT probe
substrates. Results showed that talazoparib did not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7,
and/or UGT2B15 up to the highest concentration of 10 uM, regardless of the presence of BSA, therefore the IC50
values were estimated to be >10 UM, see Table 31.

In vitro transporter inhibition (Studies BMN673-13-070 and PF-06944076_19Oct17_051609)
The potential for talazoparib to inhibit various intestinal, hepatic and renal transporters were evaluated in vitro.
Overall, based on the in vitro results, talazoparib showed a low potential to cause DDI by inhibiting P-gp and
BCRP both intestinally and systemically or inhibiting OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, BSEP,
MATE1 and MATE2-K systemically at clinically relevant concentrations, see Table 32.

In vitro evaluation of the induction potential
In vitro CYP induction (Study BMN673-14-003)
The potential of talazoparib to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 mRNA expression and enzymatic activities
were investigated in vitro in 3 different lots of cryopreserved human hepatocytes cultures with talazoparib
concentrations ranging from 0.003 to 10 UM. The positive controls for induction were omeprazole (50 UM) for
CYP1A2, phenobarbital (750 UM) for CYP2B6, and rifampin (20 UM) for CYP3A4, while flumazenil (25 UM) was
used as a negative control. Following treatment for 3 days with talazoparib, there was little or no change in the
hepatocyte cell morphology with talazoparib concentrations up to 10 UM, and little or no release of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) as a measure of cell toxicity. Talazoparib did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or
CYP3A4 mRNA levels and enzymatic activities at concentration up to 3 uM, see Table 33. However, at 10 UM, a
greater than 2-fold change was seen in CYP2B6 mRNA levels for one of three lots of hepatocytes (7% of positive
control) and greater than 2-fold change in CYP3A4 mRNA levels for two of three lots of hepatocytes (13% and
39% of positive control, respectively), suggesting that talazoparib may have induced these isoforms in vitro. No
increase in enzymatic activity was seen at 10 UM for any isoform, except for CYP3A4/5 activity in one lot of
hepatocytes.

Between October 2013 and April 2017, 995 patients were screened for this study and 431 patients were
randomized. A total of 145 study sites randomized at least 1 patient: 43 study sites in the US, 74 study sites in
Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, UK, Russia, Ukraine, and Israel), and 28 study
sites in other countries (Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan). A total of 156 patients (36.2%) were
enrolled in the US, 190 patients (44.1%) in Europe, and 85 patients (19.7%) in the Rest of World.
Conduct of the study
Protocol amendments
The protocol was changed four times by administrative letters #1, #2, #3 and #4, dated respectively 14th of July
2014, 23rd of July 2014, 1st of May 2015 and 09th of February 2017. The original protocol dated 17th July 2013
was amended once (14th December 2015); this amendment incorporated the 3 protocol clarification letters
(14th July 2014, 23rd July 2014, and 01st May 2015) previously issued by the initial Sponsor (BioMarin).
Amendment 1 (14 December 2015) was finalized after 184 patients had been randomized. The main purpose of
the amendment was to change the Sponsor from BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. to Medivation, Inc. and update
EMA/270498/2019
Page 71/140
all contact information (including for safety reporting and medical monitor). Other important changes expanded
the eligibility criteria, extended safety monitoring (including new liver safety monitoring guidelines for all
patients), updated dose modification guidelines based on the type of toxicity, adjusted the secondary efficacy
endpoint analyses, and updated study procedures to accommodate study site practices.
The most common stratification error was secondary to incorrect counting of prior therapy (sites were not
initially provided with a list of drugs considered to be "cytotoxic" therapy). In addition, the initial randomization
form did not use the phrase "for locally advanced/metastatic disease; " therefore, many sites included drugs
used in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting when they counted cytotoxic drugs. The initial protocol did not clarify
that the most recent biopsy data should be used for determination of TNBC or hormone receptor positive breast
cancer status for stratification purposes, and sites variably used initial and most recent data; this was clarified in
the December 2015 protocol amendment.

Study 673-201 was a Phase 2, open-label, 2-stage, 2-cohort study of talazoparib in patients with locally
advanced or metastatic breast cancer with deleterious gBRCA mutations. In July 2015, both cohorts met the
criterion to proceed to Stage 2 based on investigator review of the objective responses in Stage 1 (central
imaging data were not available at that time).
Further enrolment was discontinued in February 2016 to facilitate enrolment in the Phase 3 Study 673-301, as
the eligibility criteria for these 2 studies became overlapping with the issuance of Study 673-301 Protocol
Amendment 1 in December 2015.

progressed to advanced disease ≤ 12 months was higher in the talazoparib arm compared with the PCT arm
(37.6% and 29.2%, respectively), suggesting somewhat more aggressive disease characteristics in the
talazoparib arm. There was a difference between the treatment arms with regard to measureable disease (ITT
population) by independent review facility (IRF), 75.6% vs 65.3%, but the disease burden seems to have been
rather similar between treatment arms with visceral disease in 69.7 and 71.5% of patients, in respectively
talazoparib and PCT arms, although somewhat more patients in the talazoparib arm had ≥ 3 metastatic sites, or
respectively 45.6 vs 41.7%. Patients with bone only metastatic disease were respectively 8.7 and 11.1%. The
histology of the primary breast cancer was primarily ductal (87.5%) but somewhat more patients in the
talazoparib arm had either lobular or ducto-lobular compared with the PCT arm, or 10.8 vs 4.9%.
Of the 241 patients with HR positive disease, 141 patients (58.5%) had received prior hormonal-based regimen
for advanced breast cancer and this was similar between treatment arms. The proportion of patients that had
not received any form of anti-hormonal treatment was respectively 9.6 and 16.7% for the talazoparib and PCT
treatment arms. Overall, 60.8% of patients had received prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced breast cancer.
The median number of prior cytotoxic regimens for advanced breast cancer was 1 and was similar across both
treatment arms. In the talazoparib and PCT arms, 38.7% and 37.5% of patients received no prior regimens for
advanced or metastatic disease, 37.3% and 37.5% received 1, 19.9% and 19.4% received 2 and 4.2% and 5.6%
received >= 3 prior, respectively. Sixteen percent of patients in the talazoparib arm and 20.8% of patients in the
chemotherapy arm had received prior platinum treatment.
At median follow up of 11.2 months, more patients in the talazoparib arm had progressed or died compared with
the PCT arm or 64.8 vs 57.6%. The difference seems to be due mainly to more patients with progressive disease
at time of the cut-off or 54.7 vs 47.2%, but the number of deaths was similar 10.1 vs 10.4%.
The median duration of PFS was 8.6 months (95% CI: 7.2, 9.3) in the talazoparib arm and 5.6 months (95% CI:
4.2, 6.7) in the PCT arm. Based on stratified cox regression analysis the HR was 0.542 (95% CI: 0.413, 0.711;
P < 0.0001) in favour of the talazoparib arm (Unstratified log-rank test with HR 0.587; 95% CI: 0.451, 0.764;
P < 0.0001). The estimated 1y PFS rate was higher for the talazoparib arm vs PCT or 37 vs 20%.
Overall, 162 patients (37.6%) were censored from the primary analysis: 101 patients (35.2%) in the talazoparib
arm and 61 patients (42.4%) in the PCT arm. The main difference seems to be due to higher number of censored
patients due to "No disease progression or death prior to start of new antineoplastic therapy" suggesting that
more patients in the PCT arm were censored based on change to other anti-neoplastic treatment, possible due
to clinical progressive disease, or chemotherapy toxicity and decision to change treatment. One patient (0.3%)
in the talazoparib arm and 19 patients (13.2%) in the PCT arm were censored due to no adequate post-baseline
tumour assessment. The difference in the proportion of patients censored between arms, 9.8 vs 20.1%, without
evident disease progression or death before start new antineoplastic treatment, is not explained.
At median follow up of 11.2 months more patients in the talazoparib arm had progressed or died, according to
investigator assessment, compared with the PCT like in the IRF assessment although the difference is somewhat
less or 75.6 vs 70.8%. The HR by stratified cox regression analysis was similar or 0.538 (95% CI: 0.420, 0.689;
P < 0.0001).
As sensitivity analysis the PFS by investigator was assessed. The median duration of PFS, according to
investigator assessment, was 7.0 months (95% CI: 5.7, 7.6) in the talazoparib arm and 4.4 months (95% CI:
2.9, 5.6) in the PCT arm (unstratified log-rank test: HR 0.558 (95% CI: 0.439, 0.710; P < 0.0001)).
Interestingly the investigator assessment resulted in higher number of progression events or deaths, 75.6 vs
64.8%, and less PFS improvement, 2.6 vs 3.0 months, compared to IRF assessment but investigator
EMA/270498/2019
Page 101/140
assessment is generally considered more optimistic and potentially more biased than IRF assessment in open
label studies.
Potential evaluation bias between the IRF and investigator assessments with respect to either the progression
status of the patient or the timing at which progression occurred were evaluated using 2 measures, the early and
late discrepancy rate (EDR and LDR). The differential discordance around each measure is defined as the rate on
the experimental arm minus the rate on the control arm. A negative differential discordance for the EDR and/or
positive differential discordance for the LDR are suggestive of a bias in the investigator favouring the
experimental arm. The overall concordance rate was 77.7% for the talazoparib arm and 80.6% for the PCT arm.
The EDR between IRF and investigator was 34.0% for the talazoparib arm and 31.6% for the PCT arm, and the
LDR between IRF and investigator was 38.6% for the talazoparib arm and 43.4% for the PCT arm.
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of PFS were conducted to assess the consistency of treatment effects across
subgroups defined by the baseline variables listed below. The subgroup analyses used stratified log-rank tests
of PFS. The median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the 95% CI was calculated for each
subgroup by treatment. The HR and associated 95% CI were estimated using a stratified Cox regression model
and displayed in a forest plot. The sensitivity analyses are considered acceptable and supportive of the primary
PFS analysis.
In the subgroup of patients who have received prior platinum, all patients that have ever received platinum
compound were included, thus not only for advanced or metastatic disease. The proportion of patients that
received carboplatin or cisplatin as prior anti-neoplastic treatment for advanced or metastatic disease was low
in both arms, or N = 31 (19 vs 12) or 7.2% for carboplatin and N = 9 (5 vs 4) or 2.1% for cisplatin; total of 40
(9.3%) patients, reflecting the study protocol and the amendment in December 2015.
In conclusion, discrepancy rates comparing IRF with Investigator were on the high side (40%), but early and
late discrepancy rates indicated no bias. Censoring rates were therefore higher based on IRF and led, as
expected, to prolonged medians to event. Investigator assessment of PFS is from this perspective the preferred
metric.
Overall, a rather convincing effect on PFS has been shown (HR 0.54, p<0.0001) which is considered sufficiently
large to make it less likely that "missing data" would negatively impact the statistically significant treatment
effect. However the magnitude of the effect could be affected. Sensitivity analyses indicating that the positive
results are reasonably robust to conservative assumptions with regards to potential bias due to
non-administrative censoring were provided.
There were no conspicuous findings with respect to subgroup analyses of PFS, including age (>50,<50 y.)
regions, BRCA1/2, hormone receptor status, capsules 4x025 or 1x1 mg).
At the time of the IA for OS at the data cut-off time for the primary PFS analysis 15 September 2017
approximately 38% had died in both treatment arms and 62% were censored. Approximately 58% were alive in
the talazoparib arm compared with 45% in the PCT arm, which represents 12.7% difference but patients lost to
follow up were less in the talazoparib arm or 4.5 vs 16.7%. OS data are still immature. A positive trend in OS is
observed (p=0.1 at about 40% event rates). However, missing data somewhat hampers interpretation. There
is, however, no indication of a detrimental effect. The planned final analyses at about 321 deaths (about 74% of
ITT population)
Approximately 77% of patients (N=333) had measurable disease and ORR by investigator assessment, without
confirmation, was 62.6% in the talazoparib arm compared to 27.2% in the PCT arm, resulting in 35.4%
difference in ORR, which was statistically significant with odds ratio of 4.99 (95% CI: 2.93 - 8.83; p < 0.0001).

safety profile of talazoparib was generally similar in patients who received 1 mg/day in Studies 673-301,
673-201, PRP-001, MDV3800-14, and MDV3800-13, the applicant considered the pooling of the respective ADRs
to provide the best representation of the safety of talazoparib.
The overall safety profile of Talzenna is based on pooled data from 494 patients who received talazoparib at
1 mg daily in clinical studies for solid tumours, including 286 patients from a randomised Phase 3 study with
germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm), HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and
83 patients from a nonrandomised Phase 2 study in patients with germline BRCA-mutated locally advanced or
metastatic breast cancer.
The most common (≥ 25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving talazoparib in these clinical studies were
fatigue (57.1%), anaemia (49.6%), nausea (44.3%), neutropenia (30.2%), thrombocytopenia (29.6%), and
headache (26.5%). The most common (≥ 10%) Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions of talazoparib were anaemia
(35.2%), neutropenia (17.4%), and thrombocytopenia (16.8%).
Dose modifications (dose reductions or dose interruptions) due to any adverse reaction occurred in 62.3% of
patients receiving Talzenna. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose modifications were anaemia
(33.0%), neutropenia (15.8%), and thrombocytopenia (13.4%).
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.6% of patients receiving Talzenna. The
median duration of exposure was 5.4 months (range 0.03-61.1).
Table 3 summarises adverse reactions based on pooled dataset listed by system organ class, and frequency
category. Frequency categories are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Body mass Index (BMI)
Safety data by BMI were analysed for the following three groups of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day
Population based on BMI: ≤18 kg/m2 (N=10; 2.0%), >18-30 kg/m2 (N=383; 77.7%), and >30 kg/m2 (N=100;
20.3%). In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, AEs reported for >20% of patients with BMI > 18-30 kg/m2
were anemia, fatigue, nausea, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, decreased
appetite, and thrombocytopenia. AEs reported for ≥20% of patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 were similar, but
constipation and thrombocytopenia were reported for <20% of patients and cough and dyspnea were also
reported for >20% of patients. As only 2.0% of patients in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population had a BMI ≤18
kg/m2, no comparison with this BMI group was possible.
Renal impairment
Mild renal impairment was defined as a creatinine clearance of 60-89 mL/min (N=157 [32 % of the Talazoparib
1 mg/day population]), moderate renal impairment 30-59 mL/min (N=36 [7 %]) and severe impairment ≤29
mL/min (N=1).
In the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population, 60.7% of patients had normal renal function at study baseline, 31.8%
had mild renal impairment, 7.3% had moderate renal impairment, and 0.2% (1 patient) had severe renal
impairment. AEs reported for >20% of patients in the normal renal function group were anemia, fatigue, nausea,
headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation. AEs reported for >20% of patients in the mild
renal impairment group were similar but additionally included decreased appetite, while headache, vomiting,
and constipation were reported for <20% of patients. AEs reported for >20% of patients in the moderate renal
impairment group were also similar to those reported for >20% of patients with normal renal function, but with
the addition of thrombocytopenia and decreased platelet count, while headache and diarrhea were reported for
<20% of patients. Only 1 patient in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population had severe renal impairment so
comparisons with this group were not possible.
Hepatic impairment
Hepatic impairment was defined as TBL or AST > ULN at baseline. Patients in the `Talazoparib 1 mg/day"
population had baseline TBL up to 1.5x ULN (up to 3x ULN for patients with Gilbert's syndrome) and ALT or AST
up to 2.5x ULN (or up to 5x ULN if due to liver metastases). Of this population (N=494), 127 patients (25.7 %)
had hepatic impairment at study baseline. AEs reported for >20% of patients in the normal hepatic function
group were anemia, fatigue, nausea, headache, neutropenia, diarrhea, alopecia, vomiting, constipation, and
decreased appetite. AEs reported for >20% of patients in the hepatic impairment group were similar, but
alopecia and decreased appetite were reported for <20% of patients, and thrombocytopenia was also reported
for ≥20% of patients.
Thrombocytopenia was the only AE reported at a >10% higher incidence in patients with hepatic impairment
than patients with normal hepatic function in the talazoparib arm of Study 673-301 (27.8% in the hepatic
impairment group vs 12.1% in normal hepatic function group). No AEs were reported at a >10% higher
incidence in the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population; the biggest difference between hepatic function groups was
for thrombocytopenia (26.8% in the hepatic impairment group vs 17.2% in the normal hepatic function group),
which was also reported at a higher incidence in patients with hepatic impairment in the PCT arm of Study
673-301 (11.1% vs 3.3%).

a. Includes all patients who completed treatment in Studies PRP-001, MDV3800-03, MDV3800-04 and MDV3800-14, subsequently enrolled in the open-
label extension study (MDV3800-13), and initiated treatment with talazoparib at 1 mg/day in either the originating or extension study.
b. 35 patients who initiated Studies PRP-001 or MDV3800-14 at talazoparib 1 mg/day and continued in the extension study (MDV3800-13) are counted
only once in the total number of patients for the Talazoparib 1 mg/day Population. Excludes the PCT arm of Study 673-301.
The proportion of permanent discontinuations of talazoparib due to TEAEs is overall reassuringly low (4.5 % in
study 673-301 and 3.6 % in the overall ` Talazoparib 1 mg/day' population). In the 673-301 study, anaemia
was the reason for discontinuation of talazoparib in two patients. Otherwise there were isolated miscellaneous
reasons for permanent discontinuation.
Safety update
Updated safety data were submitted for the 1 mg dataset (494 patients in the initial submission and 502 patients
in the updated data set; all 8 additional patients were in the open-label extension Study MDV3800-13 [Study
C3441010]). The overall data cutoff date for the updated safety review was 31 January 2018. Earlier data cutoff
dates were used for studies with no active patients as of the safety update data cutoff date (Talazoparib NDA
90-Day Safety Update Report).
