Batch Analyses
Batch information and release data on multiple lots of REGN10933 and REGN10987 are provided. Batch
release data indicate robust reproducible manufacturing processes. All pre-defined acceptance criteria
were met.
In addition, information on preclinical batches is provided. The preclinical lots were used to create the
initial reference standard for REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively.
Reference standard
REGN10933 and REGN10987 reference standards are used in all routine in-process, release, and stability
testing. In principle, candidate reference standard material for qualification may originate from any batch
of GMP produced formulated active substance.
A history of the reference standard used during development is provided. The initial reference standard
for REGN10933 and REGN10987 were derived from tox batches. Based on data provided, process
development material as reference standard for both sites is accepted.
The current primary reference standards were tested according to the specification in place at the time of
reference standard qualification, against the respective previous reference standard.
Results for qualification of the primary and working reference material for REGN10933 and REGN10987
are considered acceptable.
Overall, the primary reference standards are considered appropriately characterised in-house primary
reference materials for REGN10933 and REGN10987.
Container closure system.
The material meets Ph. Eur. requirements. Physicochemical testing is performed on the bottle and cap in
accordance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.2.1, Plastic Containers for Aqueous Solutions for Infusion. The material met
all required testing acceptance criteria.
Based on acceptable biocompatibility and physicochemical testing, demonstrated lack of solvent loss and
gas permeation, acceptable extractable and leachable evaluations, and demonstrated temperature and
procedural control conducted using the same container closure, the container closure system has been
demonstrated to be suitable.
Different container closure systems for the formulated active substances are used at each site but both
are commonly known from other monoclonal antibody products. This is acceptable.
Stability
Stability summary and conclusion
The proposed shelf life for REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances manufactured at both sites is
based on product-specific data, in conjunction with the Applicant's extensive platform manufacturing
experience and product knowledge, as well as long-term stability data from other IgG1 antibodies from
the Applicant.
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitments
A post-approval stability protocol and commitment are provided.
Stability data
Currently, real-time, real temperature stability data is provided for the active substances.
Assessment report
EMA/680189/2021
Page 21/147
Little to no degradation is expected in REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products; therefore,
REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances are expected to be stable at the long-term storage
conditions, and the same shelf life is proposed for the active substances as for the finished products.
Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, the proposed approach to justify REGN10933 and
REGN10987 active substances shelf life, as well as long-term stability data from other IgG1 antibodies
from the Applicant, are considered acceptable.
Shelf life for REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances is acceptable.
2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
Description of the finished product
REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products are in an aqueous buffered solution, pH 6.0, containing
the following compendial excipients: L-histidine and L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate,
sucrose, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI). The qualitative and quantitative composition in
excipients is identical for REGN 10933 and REGN10987. Ronapreve formulation does not contain
preservatives.
The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow.
There are two finished product presentations (see above) corresponding to 1332 mg of each antibody in
20 mL multidose vial (11.1 mL withdrawable volume) and 300 mg of each antibody in 6 mL single-use
vial (2.5 mL withdrawable volume). The same vial can be used for both infusion and SC routes.
The two finished product presentations use the same Type I clear glass vial equipped with an
elastomeric butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal cap with flip-off button.
Formulation development
REGN10933 and REGN10987, used in the preclinical toxicology studies to assess safety and tolerability
in non-human primates following IV infusion and SC injection, were formulated at 120 mg/mL.
Based on experience gained during previous product development activities, a platform formulation
approach was used to identify a formulation.
The results from the accelerated and stress stability studies demonstrated the same main degradation
pathways for the REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulation.
In addition, the formulation is compatible with the glass vials and the stoppers; and the formulation
stability profile indicates acceptable long-term storage stability at 2ºC to 8ºC.
There are no overages included in the formula. An overfill is required to ensure that there is adequate
volume in the vial to provide the required dose.
Physico-chemical properties are provided.
The rationale to select the final composition/formulation is sufficiently described and accepted. The
presented overview of the formulation development is acceptable. The formulation is considered robust.
Manufacturing process development
Initial supplies for Phase I and Phase I/II/III (pivotal) clinical studies were manufactured by filling
formulated active substances into fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags. Two vial presentations
were used to supply pivotal clinical studies. There are no differences between the glass vials used to

In addition, concentration-dependent binding to immobilized monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Figure
2) as well as concentration-dependent blocking of binding of dimeric SARS-CoV2 RBD to human ACE2
(summarized in Table 2) was demonstrated for REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 using different
ELISA formats.

Fc functions
To understand whether REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 are capable of mediating effector
function, ADCP activity and ADCC in primary human cell bioassays were assessed utilizing monocyte-
derived phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (3 independent donors). Results for the experiments with
the NK cells are presented in Figure 3.

Repeat dose toxicity
In a 4-week GLP study in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys aged 2.2-4 years (study R10933-TX-
20064), weekly IV injections of 50 mg/kg REGN10933 alone or REGN10987 alone, or weekly IV or SC
injections of up to 150 mg/kg/antibody REGN-COV2 were well tolerated. Incidences of increased ALT, lens
opacity and injection site abrasions were considered unlikely related to treatment, due to slight severity,
single incidences, and (except for skin abrasion) similar findings in non-treated animals.
Cytokine levels measured for 5 days following first dose were either below LLOQ (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and
IFN-Y), or not considered treatment-related (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, and IL-8) due to low magnitude (within
predose or control ranges) and sporadic findings. In addition, sporadic increases in plasma MCP-1
concentrations above control levels were observed in 4 animals on Day 1, considered of uncertain relation
to REGN10933 and/or REGN10987 administration.
Based on the lack of adverse effects, the NOAEL is considered to be 50 mg/kg REGN10933 and 50 mg/kg
REGN10987 when administered alone and 150 mg/kg/antibody (total dose of 300 mg/kg) for REGN-COV2,
the highest doses evaluated.
Based on exposure levels at NOAEL and predicted human exposure based on population PK models for
REGN10933 and REGN10987, generated by interim data from clinical studies COV-2067, COV-20145 and
COV-2069, the estimated margins were >38 at single therapeutic or prophylactic doses and ≥ and ≥17
at repeated prophylactic doses
Genotoxicity
No genotoxicity studies were conducted for REGN-COV2. This is acceptable for an exogenous target and
in line with ICH S6(R1).
Carcinogenicity
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted for REGN-COV2. This is acceptable for an exogenous target
and in line with ICH S6(R1).
Reproduction Toxicity
During the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (2.2 to 4.0 years
old) (R10933-TX-20064), there were no drug-related macroscopic or microscopic changes in the testes,
epididymides, ovaries, uterus, or vagina. The study did not identify any potential risks to fertility. Because
REGN10933 and REGN10987 are directed against an exogenous target (SARS-CoV-2), dedicated
reproductive and developmental toxicology studies or studies in juvenile animals were not conducted,
consistent with the ICH S6(R1). This is also supported by the lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or
foetal tissues in the tissue cross reactivity studies (see further below).
Toxicokinetic data
In the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study, continuous exposure to total REGN10933, total
REGN10987, or total REGN-COV2 was maintained in all drug-treated animals throughout the treatment
period with detectable concentrations observed in all drug-treated animals through the end of the recovery
period. Dose-proportional increases in exposure were observed across the individual mAb and combination
dose groups during the treatment and the recovery periods, indicating that linearity in PK was maintained
throughout the study and there was no impact on the TK of the individual REGN10933 or REGN10987
mAbs when given in combination. Results are summarised in Table 8.

Notes: Accumulation ratio was calculated as: Mean Ctrough at Dose 4/mean Ctrough at Dose 1.
REGN10933 or REGN10987 was administered via a bolus IV injection or a slow bolus SC injection at a volume of 2 mL/kg.
No apparent impact of ADA on total REGN10933 and total REGN10987 concentration-time profiles was
observed in the definitive PK study or in the toxicology study. However, in the pilot PK study, 1 animal
that received 1 mg/kg REGN10987 via IV injection exhibited a precipitous decline in serum concentrations
of REGN10987 after dosing. Concentrations considered to be impacted by ADA were excluded from mean
concentration calculations and NCA.
Local Tolerance
Local tolerability of the IV administration of REGN10933 and REGN10987 alone or the IV or SC
administration of REGN-COV2 was evaluated in the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in
cynomolgus monkeys (R10933-TX-20064). There were no drug-related macroscopic or microscopic
findings at the IV or SC administration sites.
Other toxicity studies
Antigenicity
Serum samples were not analysed for potential ADA formation/ This was assessed by visual inspection
of individual concentration-time profiles in the single-dose pilot PK study (R10933-PK-20074), the single-
dose definitive PK study (R10933-PK-20071), and the 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study (R10933-TX-
20064). The overall impact of ADA was low and generally dose independent. The observed potential ADA
responses in monkeys are not necessarily predictive of immunogenicity in humans and did not affect the
ability to characterize the PK or safety profiles of REGN10933, REGN10987, or REGN-COV2 in the monkey
studies. It is however not clear whether the method used to quantitate REGN-COV2 in monkey serum
actually will report a reduction in REGN-COV2 exposure as a result of neutralizing ADAs.
Immunotoxicity
No drug-related hematologic changes or changes in plasma cytokine concentrations observed during the
GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, no drug-related
macroscopic or microscopic findings were noted in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, or
liver. GLP-Tissue Cross reactivity studies (R10933-TX-20129, R10933-TX-20065)

For study COV-2067, concentration results for casirivimab and imdevimab for the paediatric dose
equivalent to the adult 1200 mg IV dose are available for a total of 24 paediatric patients (N=19 at
weight ≥ 40 kg), and in 26 paediatric subjects (N=22 at weight ≥ 40 kg) for the paediatric dose
equivalent to the adult 2400 mg IV dose. For study COV-2069, casirivimab and imdevimab
concentration results for the paediatric dose equivalent to the adult 1200 mg SC dose are available for a
total of 65 paediatric subjects (N=64 at weight ≥ 40 kg).
The observed casirivimab and imdevimab Ceoi and C28 values for paediatric subjects in the ≥40 kg
body weight tiers (COV-2067) were similar to those values observed in adult outpatients following the
1200 and 2400 mg IV doses, Concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in adolescents
following SC administration in the >40 kg body weight tiers at both 28 and 112 days after dosing were
similar to observed values in adults following a single 1200 mg SC dose (COV-2069).
Observed concentrations were consistent with population PK predicted values as shown by external
validation.
The expected exposure for casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents is listed in Tables 12, 13 and 14.

In the target population, at the recommended clinical dose of 1200 mg SC (600 mg per mAb) IV and
SC, concentration-time profiles for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable between studies COV-
2067 and COV-20145 (IV), across studies COV-2069A, COV-2069B, and COV-20145 (SC) and
consistent with the population PK model simulated concentrations, respectively, including external
validation of PK data from healthy subjects (Study HV-2093).
No differences in concentration-time profiles for casirivimab and imdevimab were observed in SARS-
CoV-2 infected and uninfected subjects. PK results indicate that COVID-19 disease severity, baseline
viral load and serostatus did not affect the PK of either casirivimab or imdevimab for the IV and SC dose
groups.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
No formal PK interaction studies have been performed with casirivimab and imdevimab.
2.4.3. Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of casirivimab+imdevimab was evaluated in multiple studies comprised of
different participant populations across the COVID-19 disease spectrum, including study COV-2067
phase 1/2 and phase 3, study COV-20145 and study COV-2069 cohort B.
Assessment report
EMA/680189/2021
Page 52/147

subcutaneous route of administration is used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would
lead to a delay in treatment.
Pharmacodynamics
The two monoclonal antibodies do not act synergistically based on in-vitro activity. However, by binding
to non-overlapping regions in the RBD, the combination product has the potential to be effective against
SARS-Cov-2 even if the virus being treated has mutational resistance to one of the components. Studies
with some of the currently known variants indicate that reduced susceptibility to casirivimab occurs
more often than reduced susceptibility to imdevimab.
Authentic virus neutralization data have been generated for a few variants (see also non-clinical
section). Ronapreve retained neutralization potency against all tested authentic isolates of variants of
interest/concern compared with reference virus (Washington-1 isolate), including the predominant in EU
delta variant.
An interim analysis of 31,102 clinical samples found no evidence that the clinical use of casirivimab and
imdevimab has led to the selection of viral variants with alterations in the RBD, in casirivimab and
imdevimab binding epitopes, or other S protein variation. Findings suggest that the overall mutation
rate is not substantially different between Ronapreve and placebo groups. Of those mutations found at
baseline or post-baseline in clinical treatment studies, the minority occurred in the RBD. Also, few
potentially treatment-emergent variants have been detected thus far. Sequencing and analysis of
additional samples is ongoing for all clinical studies which were submitted with this application. The
timeline for the updated analyses for the remaining studies is dependent on the final database locks for
those trials it is thus recommended that the applicant submits updated reports as soon as these become
available.
The ADA analyses are currently incomplete but indicate that ≤3% of subjects develop ADA to casirivimab
and ≤5% to imdevimab after a single dose. The effect of developing ADA to either component on their
serum concentrations was assessed within COV-2067. While the applicant claimed no appreciable effect
of ADA on PK, the graphs do not provide convincing evidence to support a conclusion on the effect of ADA
on serum levels.
The population PK/PD modelling which was conducted (viral dynamical modelling) based on viral load
data did not provide no additional insights in the mechanism of action but was consistent in showing the
lack of any dose and exposure response relationship. Thus, viral load data as PD biomarker is not
considered suitable for quantitative conclusion regarding dose selection.
2.4.5. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab have been well characterized in healthy volunteers
and in the target population. Due to the possibility of reduced efficacy with subcutaneous administration
when used for the treatment of COVID-19, in this setting the subcutaneous route of administration is
used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment.
The mechanism of action of Ronapreve is well established and despite the lack of clinical data on
variants of concern, non-clinical data suggest that it retains activity against these, importantly including
the delta variant.

2.5. Clinical efficacy
2.5.1. Dose response study
Study COV-20145
Study COV-20145 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the
dose response profile of single IV or single SC doses of casirivimab+imdevimab in outpatients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study was conducted with adults who had either asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2
infection or had COVID-19 but no risk factors for severe COVID-19. Participants were randomized
equally to receive a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab or placebo by either SC injection or IV
infusion
COV-20145 was designed to provide an understanding of the virologic dose response relationship for a
range of intravenous and subcutaneous doses, including lower intravenous doses than previously tested
in the COV-2067 study. An additional aim was to assess the role of SC dosing of
casirivimab+imdevimab in the treatment of outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This dose ranging
study helps establish the virologic efficacy of lower IV doses and SC doses that may provide clinical
efficacy and broaden the ability to provide therapeutic doses of casirivimab+imdevimab.
The following treatment arms were included in the study: casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg IV, 1200
mg IV, 1200 mg SC, 600 mg IV, 600 mg SC, 300 mg IV, placebo IV, and placebo SC. Randomization
occurred within 72 hours of obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test sample.
NP swab samples were collected every other day for the first week of the study to measure viral load,
and once weekly for 2 more weeks to assess potential persistence of viral load. After the first month,
participants had visits approximately once monthly for 4 additional months for safety follow-up.
Additionally, participants were asked to notify study personnel as soon as possible about any MAVs.
The primary objective was to assess the virologic efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab across different IV
and SC doses compared to placebo. For viral load, AUC for change from baseline at a given time point
was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and TWA was then calculated.
The primary efficacy variable was tested hierarchically at an a=0.05, two-sided. If a test was
insignificant, then the formal testing procedure stopped at that step. The primary analysis of the
virologic variable demonstrated statistical significance for each of the 6 comparisons tested.
Single doses of casirivimab+imdevimab of various doses showed significant and comparable virologic
reduction at all doses assessed (IV: 2400 mg, 1200 mg, 600 mg and 300 mg; SC: 1200 mg and 600
mg). Similar virologic efficacy was observed at the same dose level (600 mg or 1200 mg) whether
administered through IV or SC routes (see Table 24).
Of note, the 600 mg dose (300 mg casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab) is sought for repeated
prevention once every 4 weeks. Short term PK data are provided, and simulation data are available and
are discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section of this report.
Effects on the time course of viral load through day 7 by baseline load groups are shown in Figure 10.

Prior to amendment 8 a slightly different hierarchy was planned, in which the previously defined
primary endpoint of MAVs was also included in the hierarchy.
Interim analyses
In amendment 8 an interim analysis of the 1200mg vs placebo comparison was introduced. The 2400
mg group versus placebo comparison for the primary endpoint was conducted after recruitment to the
placebo arm was closed upon recommendation by the iDMC. If this comparison was positive, an interim
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the 1200 mg group versus placebo comparison was
planned to be performed at a level of 0.01 based on patients randomized on or before 17 January 2021
in the mFAS. Final analysis of the proportion of patients with ≥1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-
cause death through day 29 for the 1200 mg group versus placebo comparison (2 in Table 31) was
planned to be performed based on all patients randomized on or before 24 February 2021.
Multiplicity control of the interim analysis
The Gamma family alpha spending function based on the primary endpoint of proportion of patients with
≥1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through day 29 for the 1200 mg versus placebo
comparison was planned to be used to control for type I error for the planned interim and final
analyses. The parameter for the Gamma family spending function was planned to be calculated based
on the information fraction of the interim analysis, such that the alpha level at the interim analysis is
equal to 0.01 and the remaining alpha level is calculated based on the gamma parameter.
The information fraction was planned to be determined based on the sample size in the mFAS at the
interim analysis and at the final analysis of the primary endpoint for the 1200 mg group versus placebo
comparison.
In case of a statistically significant result for this comparison (at interim or final analysis), key endpoints
for comparisons 3 to 10 were then planned to be performed based on the same subset of patients (i.e.
patients randomized on or before 17 January 2021 or randomized on or before 24 February 2021) in the
mFAS in the hierarchical order above at a level of 0.05.
Non-concurrency of the treatment arms
The comparison of 1200 mg dose group to placebo was planned to include only the subset of placebo
patients concurrently randomized with 1200 mg dose group.
Results- Phase 1 and 2
The results reflect the first 799 subjects enrolled into the study, of which 758 completed and 671 met
criteria for inclusion in the mFAS (positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at central laboratory). The baseline
demographic and disease factors, including baseline serostatus, are summarised in Tables 23, 24 and
25.

Subject-reported COVID-19 symptoms were collected daily using the SE-C19 instrument developed by
Regeneron, in which subjects recorded 23 symptoms daily and by severity. The time from
randomisation to the first day on which the score was 0 for 19 symptoms (exceptions being cough,
fatigue and headache, which could have been mild/moderate (score of 1), was statistically significantly
reduced with Ronapreve vs. placebo, with a similar result for the 1200 mg and 2400 mg doses (Figure

Table 40. Hierarchy testing of key secondary efficacy endpoints in Seronegative mFAS-B, Study COV-
2069
Key Secondary Efficacy Variables
Number of weeks of symptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection (broad-term) within 14 days of a
positive RT-qPCR at baseline or during the EAP
Number of weeks of high viral load (log10 copies/mL) >4 in NP swab samples during the EAP
This hierarchical testing approach was defined in amendment 6.
Interim analyses
Previously planned interim analyses were removed in protocol amendment 6.
An initially unplanned unblinded "administrative assessment" was conducted with data of all 554
subjects in cohort A randomized on or before 16 Oct 2020, based on a database snapshot on 19 Jan
2021. None of the data from these 554 subjects were to be included in the primary efficacy analysis for
the study.

assessment of the sample size estimation based on
updated literature on infection rates; the sample size
was increased in protocol amendment 5 from 2200 to
3500 participants (Appendix 16.1.1 Amendment 6
Section 11.2). The amendment also allowed the use
of COVID-19 vaccines in participants who have
completed the EAP.
Appendix 16.1.1
Protocol amendment 6 introduced separate primary,
Amendment 6
key secondary, other secondary, and exploratory
endpoints for cohort A and cohort B. Separate
analyses, each with its own alpha allocation and
testing hierarchy, were to be conducted in these
2 study populations.
Change(s) and Rationale
From protocol amendment 1 onward, only NP swabs
were collected for the baseline SARS-COV-2 RT-
qPCR test. Previously, nasal swabs and saliva
samples were also collected.
Protocol amendment 2 eased operational constraints
by removing the requirement for participants to have
sustained exposure to the index case for at
least 48 hours (participants were to be living in the
same household with the index case) and allowed
flexibility in local diagnostic assays for SARS-COV-2
used for randomization (data analysis was based on
Change(s) and Rationale
screening samples collected for RT-qPCR testing by
the central laboratory).
From protocol amendment 3 onward, adolescent
participants (age 12 to 17 years) were allowed to
participate in the study.
From protocol amendment 4 onward, women who
were pregnant or breastfeeding and men who were
unwilling to use contraception were allowed to
participate in the study. Previously, these populations
were excluded.

identifier
This is an adaptive, seamless, phase 1/2/3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled master protocol to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
casirivimab+imdevimab combination therapy in ambulatory patients (i.e.,
outpatients) with COVID-19. Phase 1 and phase 2 have completed, while phase 3
is ongoing (for safety assessment only).
Design
8 months duration
first patient, first visit: 16 June
2020
In phase 3, details of COVID-19-related
medically attended visits are collected
throughout the study up to day 29, with
collection occurring minimally on a weekly
basis.
The trial is still ongoing because the
assessment of safety continues to Day 169.

Seamless design. This is an adaptive seamless phase 1/2/3 study. A number of
patients were initially enrolled in phase 3 prior to completion of the phase 1/2
analysis and subsequent phase 3 design adaptations. As a result, patients in
cohort 1 of phase 3 initially continued the randomization scheme designed in
phase 2, and were thus randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of placebo, or to a
single IV dose of RONAPREVE 2400 mg or 8000 mg.
Randomisation Dose Groups. Based on the results of the primary efficacy
analysis in phase 1/2, phase 3 was amended (protocol amendment 6) such that
subsequent patients in cohort 1 were randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of
placebo, or to a RONAPREVE single IV dose of 1200 mg, or, 2400 mg. As of 25 Feb
2021, per IDMC recommendation, patients were randomized 1:1 to single IV dose
of RONAPREVE 2400mg or 8000mg (no placebo).
Phases and
protocol
amendments
Risk Factor. The amended portion of phase 3 also required, as a condition of
enrolment, that patients have symptomatic COVID-19 at baseline and at least 1
risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. The risk factor requirements are
reflected in the primary efficacy analysis set.
Swab Sampling Schedule. Prior to the amended portion of phase 3, NP swabs
were collected according to the dense sampling schedule employed in phase 2.
After phase 3 was amended, NP swab sample collection was reduced to
approximately once weekly. Cohort 2 and cohort 3 were added to phase 3 in the
amended portion.
Cohorts. This tabular summary only includes patients randomized to cohort 1 on
or prior to 17 Jan 2021. Cohort 1 is adult outpatients (≥18 years). Cohorts 2 and
3 were excluded from this efficacy analysis: cohort 2 were adolescent outpatients
(<18 years at randomisation) and cohort 3 were outpatients (pregnant at
randomisation).

Nine of 12 cases in the placebo group had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result or seroconverted
whereas 0/3 subjects in the REGN-COV2 group were RT-PCR positive or seroconverted by the end of the
treatment period.
A similar estimate of efficacy applied when counting all cases since there was only one additional case
during follow-up and that occurred in the placebo group.
At baseline, ~67% per group were seronegative as defined above. By the time of cut off, 8/162 (4.9%)
in the placebo group but none in the Ronapreve group had seroconverted. 5/238 (2.1%) in the placebo
group who were RT-PCR negative at baseline subsequently had a positive result vs. none of 719 in the
Ronapreve group. Since routine RT-PCR testing was not conducted post-baseline in this study, it is
presumed that these 5 placebo subjects were among those who had symptomatic COVID-19.
COV-2066
This is an adaptive Phase 1/2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ronapreve in adults
hospitalised for ≤72 hours prior to randomisation due to COVID-19. Eligible subjects were to have a
SARS-CoV-2-positive antigen or molecular diagnostic test using an appropriate sample obtained ≤72
hours prior to randomisation and no alternative explanation for their clinical condition. Symptoms at
baseline were to be consistent with COVID-19 as determined by investigator with onset ≤10 days
before randomization.
Subjects were to be enrolled into four cohorts based on disease severity at randomisation. Those who
met >1 criterion were to be included in the most severely affected category:
Cohort 1A: With COVID-19 symptoms but not requiring supplemental oxygen
Cohort 1: Maintains O2 saturation >93% on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, simple face mask or
other similar device (saturation was corrected for altitude above sea level)
Cohort 2: High-intensity oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation, defined as supplemental
oxygen via:
- Non-rebreather mask (with Sp02 ≤96% on oxygen flow rate of at least 10 L/min)
- High-flow device (e.g. AIRVOT or Optiflow™) with at least 50% FiO2
Assessment report
EMA/680189/2021
Page 111/147
- Non-invasive ventilator, including CPAP
Cohort 3: On mechanical ventilation
Due to IDMC recommendations, enrolment into cohorts 2 and cohort 3 is on hold.
Subjects were randomised (1:1:1) to receive single IV doses of Ronapreve 2400 mg or 8000 mg or
placebo. Randomisation was stratified by country (Phase 2 only) and the type of background standard-
of-care being administered for COVID-19 at randomisation (Phase 1 and 2) as follows:
· Antiviral therapies only (e.g. remdesivir)
. Non-antiviral therapies: Immune-based therapies, both antiviral and immune-based therapies or no
COVID-19-specific treatment.
The primary objectives of the phase 1/2 (Cohort 1) of the study was to exclude futility of Ronapreve
vs. placebo based on rates of death or mechanical ventilation
Serial NP swabs were collected every other day for the first 2 weeks and then twice weekly to determine
viral load by SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and changes over time.
Analyses and sample size
The sample size for Cohort 1 assumed accrual of 35 events (death or mechanical ventilation) and a
cumulative incidence of death or mechanical ventilation in the placebo group of 25% at day 29 (derived
from the sarilumab study in COVID-19 subjects receiving low flow oxygen supplementation at baseline,
with an assumption of twice this rate in the seronegative mFAS). Applying a futility threshold of a=0.3
(1-sided), the minimum HR between Ronapreve (pooled dose groups) vs. placebo that excludes futility
is 0.827 (i.e. minimum risk reduction 17.3%). If the observed risk reduction is ~17% or lower, the
assessment of efficacy would be declared futile.
It was estimated that 43 total events in the seronegative mFAS were needed to achieve 80% power to
detect a risk reduction of 50% (HR=0.5) between Ronapreve group vs. placebo, at a=0.1 (one sided)
level of significance. Assuming patients are followed through day 29, accrual takes 90 days and 30% of
the FAS are eligible for the seronegative mFAS, 250 subjects were required across 3 arms.
Results
The analysis submitted by the applicant is based on the study population enrolled by 01 Dec 2020.
The Phase 1/2 portion consisted of the first 671 subjects randomised and treated in Cohort 1 and all
subjects randomised and treated in Cohort 2 (n=161) and Cohort 3 (n=35). While efficacy is reported
for the subjects in Cohort 1, safety is reported for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 up to the data cut off.
Subject disposition in Cohort 1 is summarised in Figure 28.

a. Duration of observation numbers presented in this table show actual duration of observation for various IV and
SC doses of casirivimab+imdevimab for unblinded studies and estimated duration of observation for blinded studies.
The numbers exclude subjects randomized to placebo.
Under the CU program, from 13 Aug 2020 through 16 Apr 2021, a total of 236 patients (from multiple
countries) were treated with casirivimab+imdevimab. Of these patients, 169 were treated under the
physicians' emergency INDs in US and 8 treated in other countries (5 in United Kingdom and 3 in Italy)
under respective health authority approval, and 59 were Regeneron employees or their immediate
family members who were treated under the Regeneron IND (Compassionate Use Tracker).
Safety data in the abbreviated COV-2066 CSR submitted as part of the MAA are presented for the
following cohorts:
· Cohort 1 (hypoxic requiring low flow oxygen - phase 1 and 2)
· Cohort 2 (hypoxic requiring non-invasive high flow oxygen - phase 2)
· Cohort 3 (requiring mechanical ventilation - phase 2)
Data from cohorts 1, 2, and 3 are each presented separately within the abbreviated CSR and within the
corresponding tables and figures since each cohort represents a different hospitalized patient population
with regards to disease severity.

Adverse events
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145)
Casirivimab+imdevimab was well tolerated in adult outpatients with COVID-19 (pooled phase 1/2/3
safety data from COV-2067 and COV-21045). No dose-dependent pattern of AEs was observed, and no
specific safety signal was identified in either study.
In Study COV-2067 higher percentage of participants in the placebo group than in any
casirivimab+imdevimab group experienced a grade 3 or 4 TEAE, treatment emergent SAE, or TEAE
leading to a medically attended event regardless of COVID-19 relatedness (see Table 68).
Across the IV dose groups in Study COV-20145 from day 1 through day 169, the highest percentage of
participants experiencing a TEAE in any dose group was 19.0%, experienced by participants in the
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg IV group, while the lowest was 7.8%, experienced by participants in
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg IV group. In comparison, 17.5% of participants in the placebo IV
group experienced at least 1 TEAE. Across the SC dose groups from day 1 through day 169, the highest
percentage of participants experiencing a TEAE in any dose group was 10.5%, experienced by
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC group, while the lowest was 4.4%, experienced
by participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 600 mg SC group. In comparison, 10.3% of participants
in the placebo SC group experienced at least 1 TEAE.

Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093)
· Study COV-2069
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in this study included ISRs or hypersensitivity reactions with
a severity of grade 3 or higher. As of the data cut-off date, there were no AESIs meeting the pre-
specified criteria in either cohort.
· Study HV-2093
For this study, AESIs were defined as grade 3 or greater ISRs or hypersensitivity reactions including but
not limited to anaphylaxis, laryngeal/pharyngeal oedema, severe bronchospasm, chest pain, seizure, or
severe hypotension. As of the data cut-off for this report, AESIs were neither reported in the placebo
group nor in the active treatment group.
Laboratory findings
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145)
In general, no clinically meaningful trends in mean or median change from baseline to day 29 were
observed in laboratory parameters or the incidence was low.
Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093)
There were no observable trends over time or notable differences between the treatment groups in
mean or median change from baseline at day 8 or at any other planned collection timepoint through the
end of the treatment period or over the entire period for any haematology parameter or chemistry
parameter in either of the studies
Safety in special populations
Elderly Participants (Age ≥65 Years)
· Study COV-2067
A greater percentage of participants in the ≥65 years of age subgroup compared to the 18 to <65 years
of age subgroup experienced at least 1 treatment emergent SAE from day 1 to the last available data.
More participants in the ≥65 years of age subgroup experienced treatment-emergent SAEs in the
infections and infestations and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOCs compared to the 18
to <65 years of age subgroup.
The number of participants in each age subgroup who experienced grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions
was very low (<0.5%).
· Study HV-2093 (all TEAEs)
Compared to the overall population, a smaller proportion of participants who were ≥65 years old
(n=126) experienced a TEAE during the treatment period, with a greater frequency of at least 1 TEAE
reported in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg treatment group (38.9%) than in the placebo group
(30.6%). The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥5%) were ISRs (16.7% in the casirivimab+imdevimab
1200 mg group versus 11.1% in the placebo group) and headache (6.7% in the casirivimab+imdevimab
1200 mg group versus 2.8% in the placebo group).
In the small subset of participants who were ≥75 years old (n=16), TEAEs occurred in 9.1% of
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 20.0% in the placebo group.

There are limited data on pregnancies occurring in patients administered casirivimab+imdevimab.
Across the studies that allowed enrolment of pregnant women (Study COV-2067, Study COV-2069 and
StudyCOV-20145), a total of 10 patients were either pregnant at study entry or became pregnant
during the study at the time of the data cut-off dates (of which 6 received casirivimab+imdevimab and
4 received placebo). A further 3 patients reported pregnancies under the EUA or compassionate use
program. Of these 13 patients, 5 had early termination of the pregnancy (1 voluntary termination, 3
SAEs of spontaneous abortion and 1 SAE of ruptured ectopic pregnancy). The 4 SAEs were reported in
patients receiving casirivimab+imdevimab; none of the SAEs were considered related to study drug. Of
the remaining patients with available follow-up information, 4 had either delivered babies without
complication or had ongoing pregnancies with no concerns or irregularities reported at the time of last
contact.
Two events of exposure to casirivimab+imdevimab during pregnancy were reported under the EUA and
1 event of similar exposure during pregnancy was reported in the CU program. No outcome data was
available for the patients in the EUA program while the patient in the CU program gave birth without
complications.

· Study COV-2069 Cohort A
Few (<5%) participants in cohort A reported ISRs during the efficacy assessment period, all were grade
2 or below, and the majority were mild in severity. The 2 most frequently reported signs or symptoms
of ISR were erythema (0.5% and 2.1% of participants in the placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab
group, respectively) and pruritis (0.4% and 1.2% of participants in the placebo and
casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively.
. Study COV-2069 Cohort B
A few (<5%) participants in cohort B reported ISRs during the efficacy assessment period. All ISRs
experienced by participants in cohort B were grade 2 or below and all were mild in severity. The 2 most
frequently reported signs or symptoms of ISR were erythema (0.6% and 1.3% of participants in the
placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively) and ecchymosis (0% and 1.3% of participants
in the placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively.
· Study HV-2093
There were no grade 3 or greater ISRs reported in this repeat dose study. More participants in the
casirivimab+imdevimab group (253/729 participants; 34.7%) reported symptoms of ISRs compared to
the placebo group (38/240 participants; 15.8%) during the treatment period. The 2 most common
symptoms of the ISRs were erythema and pruritus in the casirivimab+imdevimab group (26.6% and

Treatment reduced the viral load, the duration of symptomatic infection and the duration of viral
shedding and no subject who developed COVID-19 despite having Ronapreve required hospitalisation or
ER visits vs. 4 cases in the placebo group in Cohort and 6 cases in Cohort B.
3.3. Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The primary endpoint in study 2067 of hospitalization for COVID-19 or all-case death is a composite
endpoint, however results are driven by the incidence of hospitalization with only 5 deaths (3 in placebo
treated patients) recorded up to day 29.Therefore the data currently do not allow any conclusion on an
effect of treatment (neither positive nor negative) on the occurrence of death.
Study 2067 was also subject to numerous and late amendments, including changes to the primary
endpoint and analysis. Some of these changes, including the definition of the interim analysis are post-
hoc (data cut-off date: 18 Feb 2021, date of Amendment 8: 12 March 2021).
The effect of treatment seems to be substantially smaller in patients without documented risk factors,
but currently it cannot be concluded whether specific risk factors are predictive of the effect of
treatment.
Treatment using the SC route of administration was not studied in the pivotal trial and in the absence of
convincing dose-response and exposure-response data, the extrapolation of efficacy from the 1200 mg
IV dose to the proposed alternative 1200 mg SC dose in the treatment setting based on PK bridging is
not accepted. It is therefore recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if
intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment.
In study 2069, local testing for SARS-CoV-2 was utilized for screening based on assays available at the
sites according to their local procedures. Patients were enrolled and stratified based on the positive
result from a local sample because it was considered inappropriate to delay treatment for 2-3 days
awaiting central lab RT-qPCR results that were obtained in all patients from nasopharyngeal samples
acquired according to standardized instructions at baseline. However, as randomisation was stratified by
local laboratory test and the distinction between cohort A or B was done based on a central laboratory
test there is a portion of subjects who were assigned to cohort B although they were randomized in a
different stratum (similar for cohort A).
Efficacy in the prevention study is not demonstrated under strong control of type-I-error, as this was
controlled for each cohort (A and B) separately. The concept of two independent studies in cohorts A
and B is not fully agreed and consequently there is uncertainty on the interpretation of statistical
significance. While results in cohort A (subjects tested negative for SARS-CoV-2) are persuasive despite
this uncertainty, cohort B results were considered somewhat uncertain. Results in strata of
randomisation suggest that cohort B results may not have been statistically significant if investigated in
an independent study (p=0.23). However, post-hoc analyses indicate that prophylaxis is beneficial in
the overall population (relative risk reduction of 65.0%, nominal p<0.0001 in pooled cohorts A, B and
subjects with undetermined PCR test). Observed results in positive and undetermined subjects therefore
provide support that a negative PCR test should not be required before treatment.
3.4. Unfavourable effects
With exception of the study in hospitalised patients (Study COV-2066 Cohort 2 (Phase 2)), the incidence
of SAEs and AESIS was low, no dose-dependent pattern of AEs was observed, and no specific safety
signal was identified in either of the pivotal studies. A small number of infusion related reactions
following IV administration were observed and adequate wording is included in the SmPC to manage
these.

The number of deaths was low. None of the deaths were considered related to study drug but related to
advanced and progressive COVID-19 disease.
There were no notable differences in the safety profile of casirivimab+imdevimab, including the
occurrence of IRRs, in patients aged ≥65 years compared to aged ≥18 to 65 years. The findings
observed in the elderly population are consistent with increased age being a known risk factor for
developing more serious complications of COVID-19 disease.
Among these participants who were vaccinated during the study period, there were no grade ≥3 TEAE,
SAE or AESIs in the casirivimab+imdevimab groups following the vaccinations.
3.5. Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Select TEAE categories were required to be collected in COV-2067 and COV-2066. In both studies more
fragile patients are enrolled either patients with risk factors for developing COVID-19 disease (Study
COV-2067) or diseased patients in different stages of the disease. Whilst the reasons to restrict the
collection to selected TEAEs is understandable it is possible that the safety characterisation in those
studies may be incomplete
The number of adolescents enrolled was relatively small, which limits the comparison with adults;
however, no AEs reported in the adolescent population suggested a safety concern for
casirivimab+imdevimab.
