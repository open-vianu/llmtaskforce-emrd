2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
UC is a chronic disease of unknown aetiology that is characterised by inflammation of the colon and 
rectum. Symptoms include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain and bowel movement urgency. 
UC has a relapsing-remitting course, meaning that many patients have intermittent disease flares that 
are interspersed with periods of remission. It is postulated that UC is caused by unregulated and 
exaggerated local immune response to environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
A systematic review of studies evaluating the worldwide incidence and prevalence of inflammatory 
bowel disease reported that the prevalence rates for UC were: 
• 
140 to 286 per 100,000 persons in North America 
• 
2.4 to 505 per 100,000 persons in Europe 
• 
4.6 to 57.3 per 100,000 persons in Asia 
• 
4.7 to 44.3 per 100,000 persons in South America, and 
• 
10.6 per 100,000 persons in Africa (Ng et al. 2017). 
Diagnosis is based on symptoms using supportive evidence from an endoscopy, tissue biopsy and 
negative stool examination, while ruling out infectious disease. 
There are no known preventative medical therapies available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 11/207 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis  
The precise aetiology of ulcerative colitis is not well understood. A current hypothesis suggests that 
primary dysregulation of the mucosal immune system leads to an excessive immunologic response to 
normal microflora in a genetically susceptible host, finally leading to chronic intestinal inflammation. 
The importance of the epithelial barrier in IBD predisposition is supported by reports of abnormal 
intestinal permeability in patients with IBD and some of their first-degree relatives.  Alterations in the 
balance between proliferation and apoptosis are known to be involved in barrier dysfunction, which 
leads to IBD. 
During the inflammatory phase, resident cells produce cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the site 
of injury. Infiltrating monocytes differentiate into macrophages, key players in driving an effective 
immune response through phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic neutrophils. Mediators released 
during the inflammatory phase also recruit fibroblasts to the wound region, thereby initiating the 
proliferative phase. 
Ulcerative colitis is a serious disease that, in some cases, may cause life-threatening complications that 
can be fatal. The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon and perforation.  
Extra-intestinal complications include arthritis, dermatological conditions, uveitis, and primary 
sclerosing cholangitis. 
The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suggested to markedly increase with cumulative 
probabilities of 2% by 10 years, 8% by 20 years, and 18% by 30 years. 
The main risk factors for IBD-CRC include certain disease characteristics such as age at onset, extent 
and duration of disease, as well as non-IBD characteristics such as family history of CRC and 
concomitant diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis  
Symptoms include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain and bowel movement urgency. UC has a 
relapsing-remitting course, meaning that many patients have intermittent disease flares that are 
interspersed with periods of remission. 
Diagnosis is made endoscopically. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease characterised by diffuse 
mucosal inflammation of the colon. Ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum (i.e., proctitis), and it 
may extend proximally in a contiguous pattern to involve the sigmoid colon (i.e., proctosigmoiditis), 
the descending colon (i.e., left-sided colitis), or the entire colon (i.e., pancolitis). 
The onset of ulcerative colitis is most common between 15 and 40 years of age, with a second peak in 
incidence between 50 and 80 years. The disease affects men and women at similar rates. 
3% to 8% of patients with UC have primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic disease of bile ducts that 
predisposes affected patients to increased risks of progressive liver disease and colorectal cancer 
(Tanaka and Mertens 2016). Compared to those without UC, patients with UC are at an increased risk 
of developing and dying from colorectal cancer (Olén et al. 2020). Fear of cancer and the frequency of 
endoscopic surveillance procedures to detect UC dysplasia may also impact HRQoL in patients with UC. 
2.1.5.  Management  
Medical therapeutic decisions for UC are categorised into those for (a) induction and (b) maintenance, 
with a goal of obtaining and maintaining steroid-free remission. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 12/207 
 
Treatment goals in UC include induction of remission (typically within a 6 to 12 week time frame) and 
maintenance of remission in the longer term (assessed over 52 weeks of continuous treatment in 
clinical trials). In both clinical practice and in clinical trials, clinical response and clinical remission are 
assessed by a combination of endoscopy (improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa 
and healing of ulcers) and patient-reported outcomes, including a reduction in stool frequency (SF) and 
a resolution of RB (Levesque et al. 2015). Control of intestinal inflammation in UC is also associated 
with a reduction in the risk of hospitalisation, colectomy, and in the longer term, UC associated 
dysplasia and colorectal cancer. 
Medications used for the treatment of UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)–containing medications 
(sulfasalazine, mesalazine, balsalazide, olsalazine), corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as AZA 
and 6-MP and biologic medications. 
 A significant proportion of patients with moderately to severely active UC may have an inadequate 
response to medicines such as 5-ASAs or corticosteroids, be unable to maintain a clinical response to 
5-ASAs or AZA or be unable to discontinue corticosteroids without a relapse in disease activity 
(reviewed in Dignass et al. 2012). Many of these patients require additional treatment with the next 
line of therapy, which could include medical treatment with a biologic medication or surgical treatment 
with a colectomy.  
Biologics, including antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) 
and vedolizumab, an anti-α4β7 integrin antibody, are indicated for the treatment of UC in patients who 
fail to respond to, have an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to other medications used in the 
treatment of UC medications and as a first-line treatment for UC in selected patients. 
Approximately 40% to 50% of patients with moderately to severely active UC fail treatment with 
current biologic or small-molecule therapies in the first year of treatment.  Therefore, there is a clear 
medical need for additional therapeutic options in UC for subjects with inadequate response to or 
intolerance to conventional therapies and biologic therapies. 
2.2.  About the product  
Mirikizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) isotype monoclonal antibody that binds with 
high affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL-23), a naturally occurring 
proinflammatory cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. 
Interleukin-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines and has 2 components: the p40 subunit, 
which is shared by IL-12 and IL-23; and the p19 subunit, which is only found in IL-23. Preclinical 
studies have shown that IL-12 is a potent inducer of antitumour immunity and plays a key role in the 
protection against bacterial and viral infections (Hamza et al. 2010; Tugues et al. 2015). Targeting the 
p19 subunit of IL-23 alone therefore preserves the perceived protective role of IL-12 (Kurtz et al. 
2014; Teng et al. 2015). 
The applicant is seeking the following indication: 
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic treatment or a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, or have medical 
contraindications to such therapies (see section 5.1). 
The proposed dosing regimen for the indication is 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusion every 4 weeks for 
3 doses followed by 200 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 13/207 
 
It is proposed that , if patients do not have adequate therapeutic response at week 12 of induction 
dosing, to consider continuing to dose with 300 mg mirikizumab by intravenous infusion at weeks 12, 
16 and 20 (extended induction therapy). If therapeutic benefit is achieved with the additional 
intravenous therapy, patients may initiate mirikizumab subcutaneous maintenance dosing (200 mg) 
every 4 weeks, starting at week 24. Discontinue mirikizumab in patients who do not show evidence of 
therapeutic benefit to extended induction therapy by week 24. 
Patients with loss of therapeutic response during maintenance treatment may receive 300 mg 
mirikizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks, for a total of 3 doses. If clinical benefit is achieved 
from this additional intravenous therapy, patients may resume mirikizumab subcutaneous dosing every 
4 weeks. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development  
The mirikizumab UC Phase 3 programme comprised 3 trials: 
 
• 
12-week induction Study I6TMC- AMAN (AMAN),  
• 
40-week maintenance Study 16T-MC-AMBG (AMBG),  
• 
long term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAP. 
 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from CHMP (EMEA/H/SAH/079/1/2017/III) on 22 June 2017. 
The advice was on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology and phase studies in UC and safety 
monitoring. The development mostly followed the advice however the applicant at that time proposed 
2 separate induction studies (AMAN) and (AMAO) both of which planned to enrol 408 patients and test 
two separate regimens in UC patients who failed or were intolerant to conventional or biological 
therapies. However only a single induction study was conducted, however, overall, the development

seems to be line with the regulatory requirements: Guideline on the development of new medicinal 
products for the treatment of Ulcerative colitis (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1) 
2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion or solution for injection 
containing 300 mg in 15 mL (20 mg/mL) or 100 mg in 1mL (100 mg/mL), respectively, of mirikizumab 
as active substance. 
Other ingredients are: sodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid (anhydrous), sodium chloride, polysorbate 
80, water for injection. 
For the 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, the finished product is available in a type I glass 
vial (pack size of 1 vial). For the 100 mg solution for injection, the finished product is available in a 
type I clear glass syringe encased either in a disposable pre-filled syringe (pack sizes of 2 or 6 pre-
filled syringes) or in a disposable pre-filled pen (pack sizes of pack sizes of 2, 4 or 6 pre-filled pens). 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance  
2.4.2.1.  General Information  
The active substance (INN: mirikizumab, also known as LY3074828) is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal 
anti-interleukin-23 (anti-IL-23) antibody, produced in CHO cells, that binds with high affinity and 
specificity to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 
receptor.  
Mirikizumab is composed of two identical immunoglobulin kappa light chains and two identical 
immunoglobulin gamma heavy chains.  
 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturing of the active substance is performed by Eli Lilly Kinsale Limited, Dunderrow, Kinsale, Co. 
Cork, Ireland. The active substance is manufactured, packaged, stability tested and quality-control 
tested in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process is standard for the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Generally, 
the manufacturing process is well-described and an acceptable batch definition has been provided. The 
ranges of critical process parameters (CPPs) and the routine in-process controls (IPCs) along with 
acceptance criteria are described for each step. 
Manufacturing starts from a Working Cell Bank (WCB), which is expanded through a series of flasks 
and bioreactors. The culture is harvested, clarified, and then transferred for downstream processing. 
The downstream manufacture of mirikizumab consists of viral inactivation and clarification, 
chromatography and filtration unit operations. 
Finally, the purified mirikizumab (bulk active substance) is filtered, dispensed into the proposed 
container closure system and stored. 
Two container closure systems are proposed for the active substance: a polycarbonate container (PC) 
and a high-density polyethylene container (HDPE). The container closure system components comply 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 15/207 
 
with the Ph. Eur. 3.1.6 and Ph. Eur. 3.2.2. Compatibility, specifications and extractables/leachables 
studies are addressed for both containers. 
The registered controls are considered appropriate for routine control of a standard mAb manufacturing 
process. Overall, the active substance manufacturing process is sufficiently well described in the 
dossier and is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. 
Details of developmental genetics and the establishment of the master cell bank (MCB) have been 
provided in line with ICH Q5B.  
The general scheme for the selection, clonal-derivation, identification, and subsequent banking of the 
Production Cell Line is provided. The approach is sufficiently described and is acceptable. A safety 
assessment is provided for raw materials of animal origin used during cell line generation. 
Establishment of the MCB and WCB is described in accordance with the ICH Q5D. Date of manufacture, 
labelling, storage conditions, stability testing and storage locations for the MCB and WCB are 
sufficiently described. Characterisation of the cell banks has been carried out in line with ICH Q5D. The 
testing of the cell banks is carried out in accordance with the Ph. Eur. 2031 monoclonal antibodies for 
human use. Genetic stability has been demonstrated for cells at and beyond the limit of cell age. The 
MCB, WCB and extended cell bank (ECB) were tested for adventitious agents in line with ICH Q5A. The 
protocol for replacement of the WCB and specifications for qualifying the replacement WCB are 
described and considered acceptable.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Overall, the presented control strategy is largely in line with what would be expected for a standard 
mAb manufacturing process. The upstream cell expansion steps have controls in place to ensure the 
appropriate number of viable cells with appropriate bioreactor conditions. Appropriate controls are in 
place throughout the process. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process and all process controls have been adequately defined by the 
applicant, in line with ICH Q8. The limits for all controls have been adequately justified and actions 
taken if limits are exceeded are specified.  
Process validation 
A standard approach to process validation has been taken, which is in accordance with the Guideline 
on process validation for the manufacture of biotechnologically derived active substance and data to be 
provided (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014). Process development and characterisation studies are 
outlined in the dossier, together with data on process performance qualification (PPQ) batches 
manufactured at the commercial site and scale. The results presented for the PPQ batches show that 
the active substance manufacturing process consistently produces mirikizumab active substance of 
reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance 
criteria. 
Process characterisation 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 16/207 
 
Process characterisation followed a relatively standard approach based on risk assessment and DoE 
process characterisation studies. An initial risk assessment was used to identify potential critical quality 
attributes (CQAs). Detailed explanations of the scoring system are presented in the dossier. The 
approach is logical and is therefore considered appropriate. Overall, the list of CQAs is considered 
typical for a mAb and is fully endorsed. Those process parameters which were considered by the risk 
assessment to have a potential impact on a CQA were studied. The overall approach for quantifying 
process parameter impact and determining practical significance is considered acceptable.  
In general, the process characterisation studies have resulted in an appropriate level of control of the 
manufacturing process.  
Impurity clearance 
The clearance of impurities was addressed, and the results provided show adequate removal capability 
of the manufacturing process. 
Hold times 
Data are provided and the results support the hold times proposed. 
Resin and filter lifetime studies 
The overall approach to establish resin and membrane lifetime uses small-scale data and verification at 
commercial scale via a protocol, which is in line with the EMA Guideline on process validation for the 
manufacture of biotechnology-derived active substances (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014). The 
proposed reuse cycles are considered acceptable. 
Reprocessing 
Validation of reprocessing steps was performed. Commercial scale reprocessing protocols have been 
provided. 
Overall, the proposal for reprocessing is in line with current guideline requirements and is considered 
acceptable. 
Transport validation  
Transport conditions were adequately justified. 
In conclusion, the applicant has provided sufficient data to provide assurance that the manufacturing 
process is appropriately validated and in a state of control. 
Manufacturing process development 
The commercial active substance manufacturing process was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development programme. 
Different manufacturing processes have been described and 3 different active substances 
manufacturers sites had been used throughout the development.  
For each change, a comparability study has been carried out demonstrating that the change did not 
have a significant influence on the quality of the product. 
Characterisation 
The mirikizumab active substance has been sufficiently characterised using state-of-the-art methods. 
Brief descriptions of the analytical methods used for characterisation are provided which are 
acceptable. In general, characterisation is in accordance with the Ph. Eur. 2031 monoclonal antibodies 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 17/207 
 
for human use. The analytical results are consistent with the proposed structure, revealing that the 
active substance has the expected structure of a human IgG4-type antibody. 
The identified product related impurities are aggregates and fragments, which are adequately 
controlled. Levels of process-related impurities are described and supported by clearance studies. The 
acceptable exposure limits proposed are supported with adequate references.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification  
In general, the panels of tests are in line with ICH Q6B and are considered appropriate for routine 
control of a monoclonal antibody both at release and shelf-life. 
During the assessment, the applicant updated the active substance specifications/acceptance limits 
upon request. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been sufficiently well described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). 
Batch analysis 
All batches comply with the specifications in place at the time of testing. These data demonstrate that 
the commercial process is capable of manufacturing a consistent active substance. 
Reference materials 
A standard approach for two tier reference standards is in place. Two primary reference standards 
(PRS) have been manufactured and qualified. The primary and working reference standards have been 
sufficiently characterised. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability  
Stability data are provided in support of a claimed shelf-life of 36 months at ≤-65°C. The studies are 
conducted in accordance with the ICH Q5C and suitable study protocols are provided.  
Studies were carried out in accelerated conditions. Study data are provided in stressed conditions in 
accordance with ICH Q1A and ICH Q1B. The methods used are considered stability indicating, as 
supported by the stressed stability study. 
At long-term and at accelerated conditions, all results comply with the specifications valid at time of 
testing. No obvious relevant trends are present at long-term or accelerated conditions. 
In conclusion, the presented data support the proposed shelf-life of 36 months at ≤-65°C when stored 
in the commercial container closure systems.  
Commitments to complete the currently ongoing stability studies and to perform post-approval annual 
stability studies are provided. The proposed protocol (including adequate handling of any confirmed out 
of specification - OOS) is acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Two presentations are proposed for the mirikizumab finished product: a 100 mg/mL semi-finished 
syringe (SFS) which is assembled with device components to form either the pre-filled syringe (PFS) or 
the autoinjector (AI) presentation, and a single use 300 mg/15 mL vial. Each presentation will be 
addressed separately where necessary. 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Description of the product 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 18/207 
 
The components of the finished product are mirikizumab, sodium citrate dihydrate, citric acid 
(anhydrous), sodium chloride, polysorbate 80, water for injection. 
100 mg/mL SFS 
Mirikizumab SFS 100 mg/mL is supplied as a non-pyrogenic parenteral solution for subcutaneous 
administration contained in a 1 mL long, Type I borosilicate glass syringe barrel with laminated 
bromobutyl elastomeric plunger.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients in the formulation. There are no materials of animal or human 
origin listed in the finished product composition. The formulation data presented show the commercial 
composition is suitable to maintain the quality of the finished product. The compatibility of the active 
substance with excipients is supported by stability data. There is no overage proposed, although 
excess volume is filled into each syringe to enable delivery of 1.0 mL.  
300 mg/15 mL vial 
Mirikizumab vial 300 mg/15 mL is supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free solution in a 
20-mL glass vial closed with an elastomeric stopper, intended for single use. 
The mirikizumab vial 300 mg/15 mL finished product is diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 
5% Dextrose Injection prior to administration by intravenous infusion. The finished product 
composition of the vial presentation is identical to the mirikizumab SFS presentation, except for the 
active substance concentration (20 mg/mL vs 100 mg/mL) and polysorbate 80 concentration. 
The same formulation development approach has been taken for the vial as the SFS and the majority 
of the data has been replicated. The results of the formulation studies demonstrate the commercial 
composition is suitable to maintain the quality of the finished product, which is supported by stability 
data. There is no overage proposed, although excess volume is filled into each vial to enable delivery 
of 15.0 mL. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The pharmaceutical development programme, including the formulation, the manufacturing process, 
the quality target product profile (QTPP) and the container closure systems for the finished product, 
was developed using a science and risk-based approach consistent with quality by design (QbD) 
elements. The QTPP was defined by taking into consideration the pharmaceutical product quality 
attributes required to meet the needs of the patient and is considered acceptable.  
The QTPP and preliminary CQAs were used to design pre-formulation and formulation development 
studies with the goal of developing a stable commercial mirikizumab finished product formulation.  
100 mg/mL SFS 
The chosen process characterisation studies are considered acceptable, and the acceptance ranges 
determined from these studies are considered appropriate. 
During the development of the final commercial mirikizumab SFS 100 mg/mL finished product, 
changes were made that led to the optimisation of the formulation composition and the manufacturing 
process to support the new solution in a PFS presentation. Other change was the addition of a 2 mL 
PFS presentation. Comparability studies were performed between presentations and data suggest that 
the presentations are comparable. Comparability studies were performed to compare finished product 
batches manufactured from active substance manufactured at three Lilly sites. The results suggest that 
the finished product batches manufactured from active substance batches from any of these sites are 
comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 19/207 
 
The semi-finished syringe primary container closure system is assembled with delivery device 
components to form the final combination product. Adequate detailed descriptions have been provided 
for the container closure system components of the SFS. The container closure system used for 
mirikizumab SFS 100 mg/mL has been shown to be suitable to protect the product from physico-
chemical and microbiological factors. 
Technical information and specifications are provided for both the PFS and AI devices. A Major 
Objection was raised during the procedure regarding the lack of a Notified Body Opinion for the 
medical devices, which the applicant provided, supporting the conformity of each device with the 
relevant GSPRs set out in Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. 
300 mg/15 mL vial 
The mirikizumab vial 300 mg/15 mL manufacturing process is largely aligned with the manufacturing 
process for the mirikizumab SFS 100 mg/mL presentation. 
During the development of the final commercial mirikizumab finished product, changes were made. To 
demonstrate comparability between the presentations, a comparability assessment was conducted and 
the results demonstrate that presentations are comparable. Comparability studies were performed to 
compare finished product batches manufactured from active substance manufactured at three Lilly 
sites. The results suggest that the finished product batches manufactured from active substance 
batches from any of these sites are comparable. 
The container closure consists of clear, type I glass vial with a chlorobutyl stopper that is sealed with a 
two-piece flip-top aluminium seal. The materials of construction and the function of each component of 
the container closure system has been provided. The container closure integrity (CCI) has been 
demonstrated through physico-chemical and microbiological container-closure integrity tests (CCIT). 
The vial container closure system used for mirikizumab vial 300 mg/15 mL has been shown to be 
suitable to protect the product from physico-chemical and microbiological factors. 
An in-use study was conducted to assess the physico-chemical compatibility and stability of diluted 
intravenous solutions of mirikizumab with representative components and was considered acceptable. 
 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls  
Manufacture 
100 mg/mL SFS 
All sites registered for the finished product are fully GMP compliant. The SFS finished product 
manufacturing process is standard for a monoclonal antibody and consists of buffer excipient solution 
compounding, finished product formulation compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic syringe filling and 
plungering and visual inspection. A manufacturing process flow diagram and an adequate description of 
each manufacturing process unit operation has been provided. The information provided is considered 
acceptable.

300 mg/15 mL vial 
The vial finished product manufacturing process is standard for a monoclonal antibody and consists of 
buffer excipient solution compounding, finished product formulation compounding, sterile filtration, 
filling, stoppering and sealing, visual inspection and packaging and labelling. A manufacturing process 
flow diagram and an adequate description of each manufacturing process unit operation has been 
provided. The information provided is considered acceptable. 
Process controls 
The process control strategy for both mirikizumab SFS and vial finished products manufacture is 
outlined and includes CPPs, OPPs, CIPCs, IPSs and IPCs. The proposed control strategy is aligned to 
the established controls developed throughout the pharmaceutical development process and is similar 
between the two presentations. However, the ranges proposed for the vial presentation processing 
parameters and in-process controls are slightly different, which is acceptable. Hold times have been 
proposed and are considered adequate.  
Process validation 
To validate the SFS and vial finished product manufacturing processes, 3 PPQ batches for each 
presentation were manufactured at commercial scale. 
A summary of the process validation for the PPQ batches is provided and all batches met the 
acceptance criteria. The data provided demonstrate that both the SFS and the vial finished product 
manufacturing processes are under control and reproducible within the established process ranges and 
set points, resulting in the finished product meeting its specifications. 
A shipping study was performed, and all results met the acceptance criteria. Validation data have been 
provided regarding the device assembly, which is considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, the validation studies demonstrated consistency and robustness of both manufacturing 
processes corresponding to each product presentation. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification  
100 mg/mL SFS 
For the SFS presentation, the panel of release tests covers relevant aspects of purity, potency and 
safety, and consists of the following tests performed: appearance, colour, clarity, bacterial endotoxins, 
sterility, pH, osmolality, particulate matter, extractable volume (in compliance with Ph. Eur.), identity 
testing (sub-unit RP-UPLC, cell-based bioassay), quantity (UV), potency (cell-based bioassay), purity 
testing (SEC, non-reduced CE-SDS), charge heterogeneity (icIEF), polysorbate 80 (HPLC-UV) and 
syringe break-loose force and glide force (for which in-house methods are used). Additional, testing 
will be performed on the pre-filled syringe (PFS) and the autoinjector (AI). 
The proposed release tests are in line with the expectations of ICH Q6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on 
monoclonal antibodies. The acceptance criteria set for the specifications were discussed and updated 
during assessment and considered acceptable. 
No new impurities have been introduced during manufacture of mirikizumab finished product. A risk 
evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/Applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004 - Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 21/207 
 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. The potential presence of elemental 
impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
300 mg/15 mL vial 
For the vial presentation, the panel of release tests is identical to the SFS presentation, with the 
exception that the syringe functionality tests are removed. The release specification limits are also 
identical, except for the polysorbate 80 range. The conclusions regarding the nitrosamine and 
elemental impurities risk assessments mentioned for the SFS presentation are also applicable for the 
vial presentation. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The validation of the majority of in-house 
methods are provided in the active substance section, these are considered acceptable and fully 
validated. Method transfer reports have been provided for the analytical procedures, confirming the 
successful transfer of the methods between sites.  
Batch analysis 
100 mg/mL SFS  
Batch analysis data are provided for primary stability/process validation batches representative of the 
commercial process, commercial formulation batches, early development batches (lyophilised finished 
product vials), PFS batches and autoinjector batches. All batches met the acceptance criteria in use at 
time of development. Batch analysis data for the 100 mg/mL mirikizumab finished product in the PFS 
and AI demonstrate that there is no impact on devices following assembly and all the batches met 
specification.  
300 mg/15 mL vial 
Batch analysis data are provided for process validation batches representative of the commercial 
process, primary stability and clinical batches. Batches were tested according to the specification in use 
at time of development. All batches met the commercial release acceptance criteria and confirmed 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for both 100 mg/mL SFS and 300 mg/15 mL vial finished product is the 
same as that for the active substance.  
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product  
100 mg/mL SFS  
For the SFS presentation, the shelf-life claimed by the applicant is 24 months protected from light at 2-
8°C. 
Stability data up to 36 months at 2-8°C are provided to support the proposed shelf-life. The stability 
studies were in general performed in accordance with ICH Q5C. 
24 months of stability data are currently available for the finished product. Long-term storage data for 
the 24 months show the finished product is stable, with no trends or OOS observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 22/207 
 
Accelerated storage data at 30°C/65% relative humidity (RH) for 6 months show the batches are very 
stable.  
Supporting data are provided. 
Photostability studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q1B. Based on the photostability results, 
the finished product was recommended to be stored in its outer carton to protect it from light. This is 
considered satisfactory. 
Based on the data provided, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (shelf-life of 24 
months protected from light at 2-8°C with a patient in-use period of two weeks at NMT 30°C) are 
acceptable. 
As part of the post-approval stability commitment, one finished product batch per year will be 
subjected to stability testing and evaluation for continuous stability monitoring. 
300 mg/15 mL vial 
For the vial presentation, the shelf-life claimed by the applicant is 24 months protected from light at 2-
8°C with a patient use period of two weeks at NMT 30°C.  
Stability data up to 36 months at 2-8°C and 30°C/65% or 30°C/75% are provided to support the 
proposed shelf-life. 24 months of stability data are currently available on finished product batches and 
the long-term storage data for the 24 months show the finished product is stable, with no trends or 
OOS observed. 
Supporting data are provided. 
Photostability studies were performed on vial finished product batch, in accordance with ICH Q1B. The 
results observed for the SFS presentation were also seen for the vial presentation. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (shelf-life 
of 24 months protected from light at 2-8°C) are acceptable.  
Prior to use, the finished product will be diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose 
injection. For dilution in sodium chloride, the samples may be stored under refrigerated conditions (2-
8°C) for up to 96 total hours, of which not more than 10 hours are permitted at non-refrigerated 
temperatures (not to exceed 25°C). For dilution in dextrose, the samples may be stored under 
refrigerated conditions (2-8°C) for up to 48 total hours, of which not more than 5 hours are permitted 
at non-refrigerated temperatures (not to exceed 25°C). The proposed storage of the diluted finished 
product is supported by the data provided during the in-use study. 
As part of the post-approval stability commitment, one finished product batch per year will be 
subjected to stability testing and evaluation for continuous stability monitoring. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents  
The strategy to control adventitious agents consists of controlling potential sources of virus 
contamination both to the cell bank system and the production process, and viral clearance processes 
and is well described. No animal-derived raw materials are used during the routine manufacturing 
process, however a number of reagents of animal origin have been identified as being used during 
development of the cell line. Risk materials are described for the cell line generation. Purification steps 
are described and considered acceptable. The risk of adventitious agents from animal derived raw 
materials is considered to be low. 
Testing of the MCB, WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age for freedom from adventitious agents 
is described. The panel of tests proposed is adequate and complies with ICH Q5A. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 23/207 
 
The viral clearance studies comply with ICH Q5A and performed using appropriate scaled-down 
models. Overall, the results of viral clearance studies demonstrate the production process has 
sufficient capacity to inactivate or remove viruses.

2.4.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
During the procedure, a Major Objection was raised concerning the lack of a Notified Body Opinion for 
the PFS and autoinjector devices for demonstrating conformity with the relevant GSPRs set out in

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.5.1.  Introduction  
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody that was designed to specifically bind to 
the p19 subunit of interleukin (IL) 23. By binding to the p19 subunit, but not the p40 subunit, 
mirkizumab affects IL-23 signalling alone and does not modulate IL-12 signalling which shares the p40 
subunit. Evidence from the literature suggests that inhibition of IL-23p19 can prevent intestinal 
inflammation. IL-23 is involved in the maintenance and amplification of T helper (Th)17 cells, which 
play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders including ulcerative colitis. 
All pivotal nonclinical toxicology studies were conducted in Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) member countries, in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and according to relevant International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) guidelines that were in effect at the time.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology  
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The specificity and functional activity of mirikizumab has been characterised both in vitro and in vivo.  
In vitro binding studies established that mirikizumab binds with high affinity to human IL-23 with a 
calculated KD value of 21 pM using surface plasmon resonance analysis. Similar binding kinetics were 
demonstrated for cynomolgus monkey IL-23 with a calculated value of 55 pM, however, the binding 
affinity for rabbit IL-23 was > 1000 fold lower and no binding to mouse or rat IL-23 was detectable. In 
functional activity assays IC50’s of 82 pM for human IL-23 and 120 pM for cynomolgus monkey IL-23 
were determined. Considering the absence of binding to rodent IL-23, a mouse surrogate antibody, 
LSN2479016, was also developed to enable its use in proof of concept studies. It demonstrated binding 
affinity (KD=103 pM) and activity (IC50= 400 pM) in a similar range, albeit slight lower, to that of the 
clinical candidate, mirikizumab. Further characterisation of the binding of mirikizumab to human IL-23 
suggested that it functioned to inhibit the interaction of IL-23 with the IL-23R without affecting IL-12 
mediated signalling.  
The in vivo proof of concept studies are limited, owing in part to the absence of activity of mirikizumab 
in rodents. In mice mirikizumab significantly inhibited the ability of human IL-23 to prime the murine 
splenocytes for production of IL-17 upon restimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies ex vivo. 
Similarly, in a model of psoriasis-like disease in mice induced by intradermal injection of human IL-23, 
systemic administration of mirikizumab decreased the expression of disease markers including IL-17A, 
IL-17F and keratin-16. 
Of closest relevant to the proposed indication was the IBD model in which a mouse surrogate anti-IL-
23 antibody was tested. The model utilises the transfer of a subset of CD4+ T-cells to syngeneic SCID 
mice which results in a chronic, progressive colitis and wasting disease. Both prophylactic and 
therapeutic treatment paradigms were tested in this setting. Macro- and microscopic analysis of the 
colon suggested that use of the anti-IL-23 antibody was associated with decreases in weight/length 
and histological scores of the colon. No clear dose response was seen in either setting and in the most 
relevant treatment paradigm the statistically significant effects on the measured parameters were only 
seen in the 1 and 3 mg/kg group and not at the higher dose of 10 mg/kg. In particular, the histology 
score for this 10 mg/kg group was very similar to that of the control IgG group. The applicant was 
asked to discuss these findings and they considered that the study was sufficiently powered to 
demonstrate efficacy but did not provide any possible cause for the absence of effects at the mid and 
high doses. As this was a mouse model of IBD the issue is not considered significant and superseded 
by more relevant clinical data. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
As an IgG4 antibody, Fc effector functions would be expected to be low. This is supported by the 
negative screen with mirikizumab for binding to human Fcy receptors and in addition to C1q 
complement. The positive controls functioned as expected suggesting a low potential for unintended Fc 
receptor activity. 
Furthermore, a tissue cross-reactivity study performed with human and cynomolgus monkey tissues 
(see toxicology section) did not identify any specific mirikizumab staining suggesting a low potential for 
off-target binding and pharmacological effects.

EMA/197960/2023  
Page 25/207 
 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme  
No standalone safety pharmacology studies were performed, and safety pharmacology endpoints were 
incorporated within the 4 week repeat-dose toxicity study in line with the ICH S6 (R1) guideline. No 
mirikizumab-related changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system parameters 
were noted at the doses up to 100 mg/kg/week. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. As a monoclonal antibody the 
absence of pharmacodynamic drug-interaction studies for mirikizumab is acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of mirikizumab were evaluated in single dose studies in male cynomolgus 
monkeys using IV and SC administration. The PK reports of the single dose studies (Studies 8340712 
and 8256194) do not contain important information such as individual serum concentrations and/or in-
study validation data. The applicant provided said bioanalytical reports for assessment and the data 
was considered acceptable in support of the aforementioned PK studies. In addition, the 
pharmacokinetics were measured after repeat dose administration as part of repeat dose toxicity 
studies in line with ICH S6 (R1). Bioanalytical methods included an ELISA method for mirikizumab 
detection, and an ACE assay was developed for ADA measurement. Both assays were appropriately 
validated, and the bioanalytical analysis of the toxicity studies performed in compliance with GLP. 
Dose proportional increases in mirikizumab exposure were observed across the battery of studies and 
no obvious sex differences were evident. The mean half-life ranged between 50.5 and 72 hours in 
monkeys after single dose subcutaneous administration. Absolute bioavailability via this route ranged 
from 24% to 61%. There was no evidence of accumulation following repeated administration. Reduced 
mirikizumab exposure was observed in female animals (1 mg/kg/week) at Day 29 versus Day 1 in the 
4-week study. In the first 6 month repeat dose toxicity study where the animals were dosed via weekly 
subcutaneous injection, 6 of 16 monkeys exhibited reduced exposure at Day 176 versus Day 1. This 
was observed in 3/4 males in the 10 mg/kg/week group (mirikizumab below LLOQ in these animals) 
and 3/4 females in the 100 mg/kg group (as per Study 20043324 report). ADAs were not measured in 
either of these studies.  
In the second 6-month study mirikizumab was dosed twice weekly via intravenous injection. Dose-
proportional increases in exposure were observed, with no sex differences. ADAs were measured in 
this study with 7 animals (4 at 100 mg/kg, 3 at 300 mg/kg) testing positive for ADAs. Exposure at Day 
176 was lower in one ADA-positive female, however, other ADA-positive animals did not exhibit any 
significant reduction in serum mirikizumab levels. Exposure and ADA levels were also measured in the 
ePPND study where the animals were dosed twice weekly via intravenous injection from GD 21 to 
parturition. The majority of pregnant females (12/15) were ADA-positive (5/10 infants also ADA-
positive); this was not associated with reduced exposure in either mothers or infants. Thus, the impact 
of ADA generation does not appear to alter exposure (see Toxicology section for more discussion).    
No distribution, metabolism or excretion studies were performed for mirikizumab and none would be 
expected for a monoclonal antibody. Placental transfer studies were not conducted, however, the 
presence of mirikizumab in the serum of infants was noted for 10 of 10 infants measured on Day 28 
post birth (BD 28) and for 1 of 10 at BD 84. The applicant considers this attributable to placental 
transfer. No studies on milk excretion were conducted, however, the applicant maintains that IgG 
antibodies are known to be excreted in human milk. The exposure in infants is most likely due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 26/207 
 
placental transfer and, as any exposure via primate milk, is anticipated to be low and subject to 
degradation in the gastrointestinal tract of infants. This is an acceptable conclusion, and this 
information has been considered in 4.6. of the SmPC.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetic evaluation of mirikizumab is acceptable. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology  
The toxicology package submitted by the applicant comprised studies in a single species (cynomolgus 
monkey) using the intended clinical routes of administration (intravenous and subcutaneous). The 
choice of a single species is in line with relevant guidance for biopharmaceuticals and the applicant has 
demonstrated that cynomolgus monkeys are the appropriate species of choice. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
Single-dose toxicity studies with mirikizumab have not been conducted which is acceptable and in line 
with the guidance. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
The pivotal studies included a 4-week repeat dose toxicity study which used both subcutaneous and 
intravenous routes of administration, and two 6-month repeat dose toxicity studies, one using weekly 
subcutaneous injections and the second using twice weekly intravenous injections. All studies were 
performed in compliance with GLP. 
Toxicities in the general repeat dose studies were considered non-adverse and transient and no target 
organ of toxicity was identified. Mild cell infiltration at injection sites was noted in the 4-week study; 
this was not associated with any clinical observations or macroscopic findings. There was a total 
absence of toxicity in the first 6-month study at doses up to 100 mg/kg/week (subcutaneous 
administration). The second 6-month study administered twice weekly doses of 100 or 300 mg/kg 
mirikizumab intravenously. This resulted in greater systemic exposure and some mild toxicities were 
observed. These included minimal increases in blood glucose in males and increased cholesterol levels 
(both sexes) at the highest dose which returned to pre-treatment levels by the end of dosing. 
Haemosiderin deposition in liver cells was noted post-mortem, possibly indicative of a degree of iron 
overload which may have impacted cholesterol levels. The applicant provided additional detail on the 
haemosiderin finding, which was observed in a single female animal. The aetiology of this observation 
was attributed to a secondary effect of idiosyncratic immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia and is not 
indicative of a generalised iron disorder or drug-related effects on hepatic cells. The applicant did not 
provide a possible mechanism for the elevation in cholesterol levels, however as levels were not 
elevated at Day 180 and no evidence of hepatic injury or dysfunction was observed it is possible that 
the cholesterol changes may not be physiologically relevant. In relation to blood glucose, the increases 
were in males only and up to 68% higher in individual animals, albeit returning to approximately pre-
treatment levels at the end of dosing. Although significantly elevated blood glucose has not observed 
clinically with mirikizumab, there is clinical evidence in other IL-23 inhibitors for a potential effect on 
blood glucose homeostasis. Further discussion was provided on this point by the applicant. The 
increases in glucose were transient and also considered within the normal range for male cynomolgus 
monkeys. Furthermore, the limited clinical evidence surrounding IL-23 inhibitors and blood glucose 
homeostasis suggests a blood glucose-lowering effect (if any), in contrast with the observations in 
male cynomolgus monkeys. Overall, it can be agreed that the clinical relevance of these findings is 
limited. Some haematologic changes were observed in one female at 300 mg/kg/dose, correlating with 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 27/207 
 
immune-mediated haemolysis as a result of mirikizumab exposure. Minimal microscopic changes in 
cells in the bone marrow, lymph node, liver and spleen correlated with this, however the low incidence, 
lack of dose response and absence of clinical observations suggest that the clinical relevance of these 
observation is also minimal. In both six-month studies immunophenotyping, T-dependent antibody 
responses and NK cell cytotoxicity was assessed without any significant effect of mirikizumab on the 
parameters measured. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity  
Because mirikizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no genetic toxicity studies were conducted. This 
acceptable and in line with the requirements of ICH S6 (R1) 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity  
A weight-of-evidence approach was used to assess carcinogenicity in lieu of dedicated carcinogenicity 
studies. The on-target activity of mirikizumab to reduce circulating IL-23 is not likely to be 
tumorigenic, as elevated Il-23 is associated with higher tumour incidence and progression. The 
absence of proliferative signals in repeat dose toxicity studies also supports the lack of carcinogenic 
potential of mirkizumab as does the absence of any significant immunotoxicity or immunomodulatory 
activity in these studies. Thus, the applicant’s approach and conclusions are acceptable. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity was evaluated in a single enhanced pre- and postnatal 
development (ePPND) study in cynomolgus monkeys. The study was conducted largely in line with ICH 
S5 (R3). It was also carried out as part of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). Mirikizumab 
was administered intravenously twice weekly at a single dose level of 300 mg/kg from GD 21 until 
parturition with infants followed up for 6 months after birth.  
No evidence of maternal toxicity was noted with clinical observations in adult females limited to non-
adverse minimally increased levels of cholesterol compared to controls on GD 140. The incidence of 
embryo/fetal loss was higher in the mirikizumab treated group at 26.7% (4/15) compared to the 
control group at 6.7% (1/15). The incidence rate of the mirikizumab treated group is within the range 
of the historical control values for the facility and the applicant has concluded that the increased 
incidence in the mirikizumab group is not treatment related as the vehicle control group survival rate 
was unexpectedly low, confounding a direct comparison. The applicant was requested to provide a 
table with each of the control values from the 22 ePPND studies which are referenced as the historical 
control range to further support this assertion of a lack of treatment effect. The data subsequently 
provided demonstrates that the historical control data was suitably robust and the increased incidence 
relative to concurrent control is unlikely to be related to mirikizumab. High prenatal loss rates from 0 
to 40% have been reported for the cynomolgus monkey according to the literature cited by the 
applicant. The applicant was asked to comment on the adequacy of group size in order to evaluate 
adverse effects on development given the high and variable fetal/infant loss rate in this species. A 
group size of 15 pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were used in this study, in line with relevant guidance 
(ICH S6, ICH S5 (R3)) and several literature studies. The number of evaluable infants a PND7 in this 
study were 13 and 10 for control and mirikizumab groups, respectively, which is considered adequate 
for the assessment of postnatal development. The sex ratio and mean gestation lengths were 
comparable between groups. The loss of two infants occurred within seven days of birth (1 in control; 
1 in mirikizumab group). In surviving infants there were no mirikizumab related changes in changes in 
clinical signs, body weight, neurobehavioral or neurologic evaluations, external evaluations,

EMA/197960/2023  
Page 28/207 
 
morphometric measurements, ophthalmology, and respiration or heart rates. In addition, an 
assessment of immunophenotype, TDAR, and NK cell activity was performed in the infants with no 
mirikizumab related effects seen. 
Adequate exposure was achieved in maternal species and exposure was also confirmed in offspring up 
to 84 days post-birth. Concentration ratios of mirikizumab in infant serum to mother serum ranged 
from 1.09 to 19.2 on postpartum day (PPD)14 and from 0.696 to 18.0 on PPD28. ADAs were detected 
in 12 of 15 pregnant females and five of 10 infants with no apparent neutralizing impact. There is no 
indication that mirikizumab was measured in maternal milk and this is reflected in labelling. In SmPC 
section 4.6 the applicant states contraception should be used for 10 weeks post treatment, however 
the basis of this is unclear. The applicant confirmed that the time period represents an approximate 7 
half-lives of exposure based on the half-life of 9.3 days. This is acceptable. A revision of the wording in 
relation to ‘Breastfeeding’ in section 4.6 of the SmPC was updated in line with other monoclonal 
antibodies. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data  
Toxicokinetic data confirmed adequate exposure was achieved across the studies. The applicant 
derived exposure-based safety margins based on ‘normalised’ AUC to account for differences in dosing 
regimen between animal and clinical regimens. The exposure-based safety margin for both induction 
and maintenance phases of clinical treatment are sufficient. As discussed in the Pharmacokinetics 
section, ADA generation did not impact exposure. 
2.5.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance was investigated as part of repeat dose toxicology studies using subcutaneous 
administration. Mirikizumab appears to be well tolerated with minimal irritancy at the site of 
administration which consisted of non-adverse perivascular eosinophil and mononuclear cell infiltration 
at the injection site. This evaluation is considered acceptable. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies  
Tissue cross-reactivity study 
The cross-reactivity of mirikizumab was assessed in a full panel of normal tissues from human and 
cynomolgus monkey donors. This GLP-compliant tissue reactivity study confirmed the specificity or 
mirikizumab for soluble IL-23 by the absence of staining in human and monkey tissue 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity was concomitantly investigated in repeat dose studies and no changes in parameters 
of T-cell or B-cell function indicate that mirikizumab is not potently immunosuppressive. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
Mirikizumab is a sequence of amino acids and a protein and in accordance with the CHMP guideline on 
the environmental risk assessment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is exempted from testing because of 
the chemical structure. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, mirikizumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 29/207 
 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal, anti-interleukin-23 (anti-IL-23) antibody that selectively 
binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor.  
IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, (e.g., 
Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector 
cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective 
blockade of IL-23 was shown to normalise production of these cytokines. 
The in vitro primary pharmacodynamic studies have sufficiently characterised the binding of 
mirikizumab to human IL-23 and identified cynomolgus monkeys as the only species with relevant 
pharmacological activity. Whilst the proof-of-concept studies are limited, it is acknowledged the 
limitations on available nonclinical models of ulcerative colitis. The provided study in an IBS model is 
considered of some relevance, and while adequately powered to demonstrate efficacy it remains 
unclear why there is an absence of efficacy of the top dose. Despite this, clinical efficacy data 
supersedes this study and thus the clinical relevance in the proposed indication is limited. 
The provided PK package is in line with the expectations for a monoclonal antibody. 
The nonclinical toxicology package is broadly in line with the requirements of ICH S6 (R1) with 
cynomolgus monkeys identified as the only species with relevant pharmacological activity. In general, 
mirikizumab was well tolerated.  
No reproductive organ weight or histopathology effects were observed in sexually mature cynomolgus 
monkeys that received mirikizumab once weekly for 26 weeks, at a dose of 100 mg/kg (at least 
30 times the human maintenance dose). The effect of mirikizumab on human fertility has not been 
evaluated which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In the intravenous 6-month study there were several observations that could be potentially of clinical 
relevance and required further explanation and discussion by the applicant. Two findings of concern 
were raised, related to possible effects on glucose homeostasis and liver function. The position 
presented by the applicant suggests that blood glucose homeostasis is unlikely to be altered by 
mirikizumab in clinical settings as effects in monkeys were transient and the elevation was still within 
the normal range for this species. Similarly, the observation of haemosiderin deposits in a single 
female monkey, in the absence of any pathological correlate related to liver dysfunction suggests this 
has limited clinical relevance. These considerations were accepted by the CHMP. 
In the ePPND study an increased incidence of embryo/fetal loss was seen in the mirikizumab treated 
group. The applicant has argued that the study is confounded by the atypically low level of 
embryo/fetal loss in the control group and that the levels seen in the mirikizumab treated group are 
within the bounds of historical control data and hence are not mirikizumab related. The applicant 
subsequently provided such data in support of their position. As there is also a limited amount of data 
from the use of mirikizumab in pregnant women the SmPC advises in 4.6 to avoid Omvoh during 
pregnancy which is acceptable. The applicant also provided data on group sizing in the ePPND study 
that demonstrated a suitable group size for dams and infants was included in the study.  
Placental transfer studies were not conducted, however, the presence of mirikizumab in the serum of 
infants was noted for 10 of 10 infants measured on Day 28 post birth (BD 28) and for 1 of 10 at BD 
84. The applicant considers this attributable to placental transfer. No studies on milk excretion were 
conducted, however, IgG antibodies are known to be excreted in human milk. The exposure in infants 
is most likely due to placental transfer and, as any exposure via primate milk, is anticipated to be low 
and subject to degradation in the gastrointestinal tract of infants. As a precaution this information has

Page 30/207 
 
been considered in 4.6. of the SmPC outlining that it is preferable to avoid treatment with Omvoh 
during pregnancy and that Omvoh could be used during breast feeding if clinically needed.  
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, Mirikizumab is not expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The MAA for Omvoh is considered approvable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects  
2.6.1.  Introduction  
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology  
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  
Characterisation of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mirikizumab for the treatment of UC was conducted 
with data from four clinical pharmacology Phase 1 studies (AMAA, AMAD, AMBD and AMBP), one Phase 
2 study (AMAC) and two Phase 3 studies (AMAN and AMBG). Population PK (PopPK) analyses were 
conducted to establish the final PK and E-R relationships of mirikizumab to support the proposed

dosing regimen. The proposed dose regimen is 300 mg IV Q4W for 12 weeks (induction) and then 200 
mg SC Q4W thereafter (maintenance). 
Bioanalytical methods 
PK Assay 
The PK assay uses a standard ELISA format based on binding to IL-23. The method is sufficiently 
described in the dossier and was initially validated at ICON and then revalidated at WuXi. The assay 
was validated over a range of 100 to 10000 ng/ml using a characterised reference standard. The 
validation criteria examined included specificity, precision, accuracy, matrix effects, dilution linearity, 
and sample stability. The results were all within the recommended acceptance criteria outlined in the 
EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2) and 
show that the assays are sufficiently precise and accurate for correct determination of mirikizumab 
serum concentration. Cross validation data showed equivalent performance between the ICON and 
WuXi assays. Bioanalytical reports were provided for each relevant clinical trial. Each report included 
the in-study validation data and the raw data from the sample analysis. The reports show that the 
assays performed as expected. The incurred sample reanalysis passing rate was ≥93%. 
Immumogenicity assays 
For the Phase 3 trials, the ADA assay used an affinity capture elution bridge format. ADAs are unbound 
from mirikizumab by acid dissociation, followed by capture by plate bound mirikizumab. The captured 
ADA is then eluted and mixed with ruthenium- and biotinylated mirikizumab. The ADAs form a bridge 
between the ruthenium- and biotinylated mirikizumab, which can be detected using the standard MSD 
approach. The approach employs four Tiers. The first Tier is the screening assay, Tier 2 is the 
confirmatory assay, Tier 3 is the titre assay and Tier 4 is the Nab assay (which uses excess unlabelled 
rhIL-23 to determine neutralisation capacity). 
The assay was developed at Lilly Research Laboratories and validated at BioAgilytix Laboratories, then 
transferred from LRL to WuXi AppTec Co., Ltd. Separate validation reports have been provided for both 
sites. The assay is described in sufficient detail in the dossier and sufficient data on the validation of 
the assay have been provided. Details of the cut-point determinations have been provided and are 
considered acceptable. The assay sensitivity was determined to be 3 ng/ml, which is considered 
appropriately sensitive for an ADA assay. The drug tolerance of the assay was above the maximum 
trough exposures for Phase 3 clinical trials. Therefore, interference and a risk of false negative 
conclusions is excluded. Interference from serum factors such as haemoglobin, lipids, and bilirubin 
were studied, and the assay shows sufficient tolerance. The assay should acceptable precision. Sample 
stability was adequately addressed. 
Overall the immunogenicity assays for the Phase 3 trials have been appropriately validated and meet 
the requirements of the EMA Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev 1) and the EMA Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of 
monoclonal antibodies intended for in vivo clinical use (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010). 
Two previous version of the immunogenicity assay was also used. A version validated at PPD was used 
in the Phase 1 Study I6T-MCAMAA, and a version validated at to Pacific Biomarkers Inc. (PBI;Seattle, 
Washington, USA) was used for Phase 1 studies (I6T-JE-AMAD, I6T-MC-AMAE, I6T-MC-AMAL, I9O-MC-
AABA) and Phase 2 studies (I6T-MC-AMAC, I6T-MC-AMAF). This previous assay format had reduced 
sensitivity, drug tolerance, and dynamic range, as compared to the improved assay used for the Phase 
3 trials. Validation results are provided in the dossier. For the PPD assay, the sensitivity was 67 ng/ml 
which was considered too high. The sensitivity was improved in the PBI assay to 8.6 ng/ml, slightly 
higher than the Phase 3 assay sensitivity of 3 ng/mL, but still considered acceptable. Drug tolerance 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 38/207 
 
was above the estimated maximum trough concentration. There was no interference form lipaemic or 
haemolytic samples. Overall, the assay is considered acceptable. 
Bioanalytical reports were provided for each relevant clinical trial. Each report included the in-study 
validation data and the raw data from the sample analysis. The reports show that the assays 
performed as expected.

Absorption  
Following SC doses of mirikizumab in patients with UC, peak concentrations were achieved within 2 to 
3 days. The geometric mean SC bioavailability across injection sties in patients with UC was estimated 
to be 44% (CV 34%) in the Phase 3 PopPK analysis.  
Study AMBW demonstrated bioequivalence following administration of 200 mg mirikizumab SC 
between the to-be-marketed autoinjector (AI) and pre-filled syringe (PFS) as the 90% CI for the ratios 
of geometric LS means (AI:PFS) for AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-∞), and Cmax were entirely contained within 
the prespecified confidence limits of 0.8 and 1.25. There was no statistically significant difference in 
tmax between AI and PFS (Table 2.7.1.8).

Although Study AMBW was not powered for the comparisons, when statistical analyses were conducted 
on data for each injection site separately, the 90% CIs for all comparisons were completely contained 
within the confidence limits of 0.8 to 1.25 following administration into the abdomen and thigh. The 
geometric mean ratio of AUC and Cmax was up to 12% higher for AI compared to PFS with the upper 
bound of the 90% CI for the various PK parameters falling slightly above 1.25 following administration 
into the arm. There was no difference in tmax between AI and PFS at any of the injection sites. In the 
popPK analysis, no significant difference in the bioavailability was identified among the 3 injection sites 
based on the covariate analysis (Figure 2.7.1.2). 
 
Distribution 
Based on the Phase 3 popPK analysis, the estimated geometric mean (CV%) central and peripheral 
volumes of distribution were 3.10 L (18%) and 1.65 L (40%) in patients with UC, resulting in a total 
volume of distribution at steady state of 4.83 L (21%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 40/207 
 
Elimination 
Mirikizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. The estimated geometric mean 
(geometric CV) systemic clearance was 0.0229 L/h (34%) in patients with UC. Clearance was 
independent of the dose. The geometric mean (geometric CV%) elimination half-life (t1/2) for 
mirikizumab was estimated as 9.3 days (40%). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Mirikizumab exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 5 to 2400 mg given as an IV 
infusion or over a dose range of 120 to 400 mg given as a SC injection. A PK model with linear 
clearance best described the data in all popPK analyses, which supports that the PK of mirikizumab are 
linear with respect to dose. 
The observed trough concentrations for mirikizumab were similar at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 in Study AMAN 
(Table 2.7.2.5) and at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and 40 for the 2 groups of patients in Study AMBG (Table 
2.7.2.6). The lack of apparent accumulation is consistent with expectations, based on the t1/2 of 
mirikizumab of approximately 10 days and the 4-week dosing interval.

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Population PK analyses 
Two separate Phase 3 population PK analyses were conducted, one using only data from Study AMAN 
(detailed in the Clinical AR) and one using combined data from Studies AMAN and AMBG. The popPK 
model developed using the combined data from Studies AMAN and AMBG was the model used to 
inform the overall conclusions about mirikizumab PK in patients with UC (detailed below).  
In total, the final PK model dataset contained 7578 observations from 1129 patients. 147 BQL 
concentrations, representing 1.94% of the total concentration samples, were excluded from the 
analysis. A 2-compartment model best described the combined data. Body weight was a significant 
covariate on clearance and volume parameters, with estimated allometric exponents. Time-varying 
albumin was a significant covariate on clearance. BMI was found to have a significant impact on 
bioavailability, where patients with a lower BMI tended to have higher bioavailability. The final 
estimated PK parameters from the combined analysis were similar to the AMAN-only analysis and are 
shown in Table 9.2. Bootstrap (data not shown) and VPC (Figure 9.7) supported the validity of the 
model and demonstrated that all parameters were well estimated.

The final AMAN/AMBG popPK model was used to perform simulations of mirikizumab exposure 
following 300 mg IV Q4W and 200 mg SC Q4W dose regimens. These simulations were used to 
illustrate the impact of body weight, BMI and albumin on mirikizumab exposures (see Special 
populations). 
Immunogenicity 
By Week 40 of Study AMBG (that is, 52 weeks of mirikizumab treatment), approximately 23% 
(88/385) of subjects treated with mirikizumab at the recommended dose developed antibodies to 
mirikizumab. Overall titres in mirikizumab-treated patients were low. For the majority of treatment-
emergent (TE) anti-drug antibody (ADA)-positive patients, the magnitude of their ADA titres decreased 
over time. 
Figure ISI.8.1 shows scatterplots of the observed mirikizumab concentrations over time during IV and 
SC dosing in Studies AMAN and AMBG, with ADA positive samples grouped and identified based on the 
maximum titre developed during the IV or SC treatment periods. The majority of patients who were TE 
ADA positive had mirikizumab exposure that was consistent with patients who were TE ADA negative. 
For patients with titres of 1:160 or higher, mirikizumab concentrations trended lower in a small 
number of patients. Upon further investigation, it was found that of the 32 patients who had a 
maximum TE ADA titre of 1:160 or higher, 10 patients were identified as having reduced mirikizumab 
exposures after first development of TE ADA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023

PK modelling found that immunogenicity was not a statistically significant factor that impacted 
mirikizumab PK. When the individual model-estimated CL values were compared among TE ADA titre 
groups, no difference in the CL estimates was found between TE ADA positive and TE ADA negative 
patients, or among the various TE ADA titre groups (Figure ISI.8.2). The lack of statistical significance 
is likely related to only a small proportion of patients recording titres high enough to show a decrease 
in exposure to mirikizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 45/207 
 
  
Overall, similar proportions of TE ADA-positive and TE ADA-negative patients achieved successful 
clinical outcomes after treatment with mirikizumab. However, there was an association between TE 
ADA-positive patients who had higher TE ADA titres and lower efficacy responses to mirikizumab as 
measured by the endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response at Week 40 in Study AMBG, when 
compared to low titre TE ADA-positive and TE ADA-negative patients. This trend was also seen when 
assessing additional symptomatic, clinical, and endoscopic UC outcomes. Overall, in 2.0% of patients 
treated with 300 mg mirikizumab IV Q4W in induction followed by 200 mg SC Q4W through study 
AMBG, higher titre TE ADA was associated with reduced PK and loss of efficacy. 
No clinically meaningful differences in the frequency of hypersensitivity events, injection site reactions, 
and infusion site reactions were observed in TE ADA-positive patients compared with TE ADA-negative 
patients. 
Overall, in a minimal proportion of patients, an association between TE ADA titre and decreased PK and 
efficacy was identified; however, TE ADA did not appear to mediate the occurrence of hypersensitivity 
events or other AEs related to injection and infusion sites.  
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of mirikizumab were not conducted. This is acceptable. Mirikizumab is a 
monoclonal antibody and expected to be eliminated via proteolytic degradation to amino acids.  
In the Phase 2 Study AMAC, CrCL ranged from 11.1 to 281 mL/min and baseline bilirubin ranged from 
1.5 to 25 μmol/L. The Phase 2 PopPK analysis did not find any relationship between these laboratory 
Assessment report

Page 46/207 
 
parameters and mirikizumab PK. The Phase 3 PopPK analysis also confirmed no relationship between 
CrCL (range of 36.2 and 291 mL/min) and baseline bilirubin (range of 1.5 and 29 μmol/L) to 
mirikizumab PK.  
Gender 
The Phase 3 PopPK analyses revealed that sex (60.9% male; 39.1% female) did not affect mirikizumab 
PK. 
Race 
Ethnicity and race were not identified as clinically significant covariates as tested in the Phase 3 PopPK 
analysis (N = 1129). The races tested were Caucasian (74.7%), Asian (22.2%), African descent 
(1.06%), Native American (0.974%), and other (1.06%), and ethnicity was Hispanic (3.81%). 
Weight 
Body weight was a statistically significant covariate on clearance and volume in the popPK analyses. As 
a result, there was an overall trend for serum concentrations to decrease as body weight increased. 
Overall, the range of body weights in Studies AMAN and AMBG was 34 to 152 kg. 
When stratified into body weight quartiles, a large degree of overlap in exposures was noted between 
body weight quartile groups for the 300-mg IV Q4W dosing regimen (Figure 2.7.2.10). The median 
AUC following 300 mg IV dosing in patients in the highest body weight quartile (83 to 152 kg) was 451 
μg·day/mL versus an overall population median AUC of 539 μg·day/mL. This difference in AUC between 
typical and higher body weights, with the AUC in patients with high body weight being approximately 
16% lower, is small relative to the between-patient variability for AUC observed for the IV dosing 
regimen (CV=34.4%). Similarly, the median Cmax in the highest body weight quartile was 84.4 μg/mL 
versus an overall population median of 99.4 μg/mL, which is also a small difference (15% lower) 
relative to the between-patient variability for Cmax for the IV dosing regimen (CV =22.7%). These 
results indicate that body weight does not have a clinically relevant impact on the exposure of 
mirikizumab, and no dose adjustment on the basis of body weight is needed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 47/207 
 
 
Body mass index (BMI) was a statistically significant covariate on SC bioavailability. The overall range 
of BMI in Studies AMAN and AMBG was 13.8 to 53.5 kg/m2. As BMI affects SC bioavailability and body 
weight affects clearance, the exposure with the SC dosing regimen would be impacted by both patient 
factors in combination. As body weight is a more typical measure of body size, Figure 11.3 shows 
boxplots of the AUC and Cmax relative to the quartiles of body weight, which would also account for 
the impact of correlated BMI differences in patients with UC. With SC dosing, the median AUC in 
patients in the highest body weight quartile was 124 μg*day/mL versus an overall population median 
AUC of 165 μg*day/mL. This difference in AUC between typical and high body weights is small relative 
to the overall range in AUC values. Similarly, the median Cmax in the highest body weight quartile was 
7.65 μg/mL versus an overall population median of 10.6 μg/mL, respectively, which is also a small 
difference relative to the overall range in Cmax values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 48/207 
 
 
Overall, a significant overlap in mirikizumab exposure was observed across patient body weight/BMI 
groups, and the difference in exposure between the highest body weight patients and a typical patient 
is small relative to the overall range of exposures. In addition, the E-R analysis found, in general, a 
lack of relationship between efficacy and mirikizumab exposure in the exposure range at the 
recommended doses. Therefore, the difference in the exposure of mirikizumab due to the body size 
effect is not expected to result in detectable differences in the efficacy endpoints. The body size effect 
on mirikizumab exposure is not considered clinically relevant and no dose adjustment on the basis of 
body weight is needed. 
Elderly 
The effect of age on mirikizumab PK was investigated in the popPK analyses and was found not to be a 
clinically significant covariate. Of the 1362 subjects with UC exposed to mirikizumab in Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies, 99 (7.27%) patients were 65 years or older and 11 (0.808%) patients were 75 years 
or older. 
Children 
No data available. 
Severity of disease state 
Baseline faecal calprotectin, baseline MMS and MMS subscores, duration of disease, prior biologic 
treatment experience, and baseline CRP, as measures of baseline disease severity, were tested as 
covariates on clearance in the popPK analyses. None of them were identified as a significant covariate. 
Albumin concentration was a statistically significant covariate on clearance. Patients with more severe 
disease tend to have lower albumin concentrations, and patients with lower albumin concentrations 
tend to have a lower AUC (area under the curve). However, a large degree of overlap in exposures was 
noted when patients were stratified by quartiles of the albumin concentration (Figure 2.7.2.9). With 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 49/207 
 
the 300-mg Q4W IV dosing regimen, the median estimated AUC in patients in the lowest quartile of 
albumin concentrations (21 to 41 g/L) was 515 μg·day/mL versus an overall population median AUC of 
539 μg·day/mL based on data in Study AMAN. This difference in AUC for patients with low albumin 
concentrations is small relative to the overall range in AUC values. Similarly, the median Cmax in the 
lowest albumin concentration quartile was 102 μg/mL versus a population median of 99.4 μg/mL, 
which is also a small difference relative to the overall range in Cmax values.  
These results indicate that disease state did not have a clinically relevant impact on the exposure of 
mirikizumab and no dose adjustment on the basis of disease state is needed. 
 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effect of mirikizumab on the PK of other drugs 
Mirikizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is unlikely to have any direct effect on drug-metabolizing 
enzymes. However, chronic inflammation can lead to disease-drug interactions by reducing the 
expression and activity of some CYP enzymes. This may alter the systemic exposure of CYP substrates 
(Wang et al. 2014). 
Study AMBP was a clinical DDI study conducted in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (PsO) 
using a “probe cocktail” approach. A drug cocktail of CYP substrates was administered as single oral 
dose during Period 1. The drug cocktail included midazolam 1 mg (CYP3A), warfarin 10 mg (CYP2C9), 
dextromethorphan 30 mg (CYP2D6), omeprazole 20 mg (CYP2C19) and caffeine 100 mg (CYP1A2). 
Mirikizumab 250 mg SC Q4W was administered for 5 doses before the drug cocktail oral doses were 
administered again in period 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 50/207 
 
The results showed that multiple SC doses of mirikizumab are unlikely to change CYP activity to a 
degree that would be expected to contribute clinically meaningful changes in the exposure of CYP3A, 
CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2 substrates. The 90% CIs for the ratios of geometric LS mean 
Cmax, AUC(0-∞), and AUC(0-tlast) were contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 boundaries for each of the 
cocktail drugs (and their metabolites) apart from omeprazole. For omeprazole, the upper limits of the 
90% CIs for Cmax and AUC(0-tlast) were 1.26, but the 90% CI for AUC(0-∞) was contained within the 
0.8 to 1.25 boundaries. For all cocktail drugs (and their metabolites), multiple mirikizumab doses did 
not have an effect on median tmax. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
Characterisation of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of mirikizumab for the treatment of UC was conducted 
with data from one Phase 2 study (AMAC) and two Phase 3 studies (AMAN and AMBG). PK/PD analyses 
were conducted to assess the E-R relationships for efficacy and safety to support the proposed dosing 
regimen. 
Mechanism of action 
Mirikizumab (LY3074828) is a humanised immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) isotype monoclonal antibody that 
binds with high affinity and specificity to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23), a naturally 
occurring proinflammatory cytokine, and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R). 
Mirikizumab is being developed for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases in which the IL-23 
pathway is thought to have a pathogenic role. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Cytokines (Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies) 
In the Phase 1 Study AMAA (patients with PsO), no apparent change in IL-23 concentration was 
observed in any of the mirikizumab dose groups. This is consistent with mirikizumab’s proposed 
mechanism of action in blocking IL-23 signalling rather than production. 
In the Phase 2 Study AMAC, statistically significant reductions were observed for both IL-17A and IL-
22 at 4 and 12 weeks post-baseline after mirikizumab treatment in patients with UC (Figure 2.7.2.12). 
IL-17A and IL-22 are downstream components of the IL-23 cytokine signaling pathway, which is 
known to be involved in the pathology of UC (Mizoguchi et al. 2018). Reductions in plasma IL-17A and 
IL-22 concentrations confirm the biologic activity of mirikizumab as a p19-directed anti-IL-23 antibody 
in patients with moderately to severely active UC.

C-reactive protein (Phase 3 studies) 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group showed a nominally significantly greater LS mean 
reduction in CRP from baseline at Week 12 in Study AMAN [-4.6 mg/L in the mirikizumab group 
compared to -0.9 mg/L in the placebo group (LS mean difference = -3.7, p<.001)] and Week 40 in 
Study AMBG compared to the placebo group [-4.7 mg/L in the mirikizumab group compared to -1.4 
mg/L in the placebo group (LS mean difference = -3.3, p<.001)]. 
Table 2.7.2.11 summarises absolute CRP values in Study AMAN. Table 2.7.2.12 summarises absolute 
CRP values in patients who responded to mirikizumab at Week 12 of Study AMAN. These results show 
that the induction and maintenance dosing regimens led to a clinically meaningful difference in LS 
mean CRP at Week 40 of Study AMBG (52 weeks of treatment).

Faecal calprotectin (Phase 3 studies) 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group showed a nominally significantly greater LS mean 
reduction in faecal calprotectin from baseline at Week 12 in Study AMAN [1875 mg/kg in the 
mirikizumab group compared to -940 mg/kg in the placebo group (LS mean difference = -936, 
p<.001)], and Week 40 in Study AMBG compared to the placebo group [-1995 mg/kg in the 
mirikizumab group compared to -1156 mg/kg in the placebo group (LS mean difference = -840, 
p<.001)].

Exposure-response relationships for efficacy 
Clinical endpoints were defined using the modified Mayo score (MMS) and included clinical response, 
clinical remission and endoscopic response. The mirikizumab exposure metric was Cavg. 
Induction dosing 
The Phase 2 dose-ranging Study AMAC evaluated IV doses of mirikizumab in a range of 50 mg to 600 
mg Q4W. Dose levels in the 50-mg and 200-mg dose groups were adjusted based on drug exposures 
during the induction period, which resulted in overall average dose levels during the induction period of 
100 and 250 mg, respectively. The observed clinical response, clinical remission, and change in the 
MMS at induction Week 12 tended to increase with mirikizumab exposure up to the 200-mg exposure-
based cohort, and then either levelled off or decreased at higher mirikizumab doses or exposures 
(Figure 2.7.2.13). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 54/207 
 
 
The model-based analyses of data from Study AMAC showed that the E-R relationship was statistically 
significant for clinical response and change in the MMS. In general, patient factors had a stronger 
impact on Week 12 efficacy than mirikizumab exposure. Based on the E-R model for Week 12 MMS 
change established with Study AMAC, induction doses of greater than 200 mg IV Q4W are expected to 
be on the plateau of the E-R curve and a dose of 300 mg IV Q4W is projected to produce 87% of 
maximal efficacy (Figure 2.5.3.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 55/207 
 
 
The efficacy observed at Week 12 in the Phase 3 induction study AMAN is generally consistent with 
expectations for a 300 mg IV Q4W dose based on the observed and modelled E-R relationships in the 
Phase 2 Study AMAC (Figure 2.5.3.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 56/207 
 
 
Model-based analyses of the relationships between mirikizumab exposure and Week 12 clinical 
remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and change in the MMS in Study AMAN were 
conducted. None of the covariates tested, including weight and BMI, were found to have an impact on 
the mirikizumab effect parameters in any of the efficacy models, suggesting no dose adjustment is 
needed for the covariates tested. A significant confounding effect was observed while examining 
relationships between individual subject exposures and individual subject efficacy in an exposure 
quartile analysis, which limited the conclusions that could be made about cause-effect of exposure 
response relationships using data alone from Study AMAN where one dose level was studied. 
Maintenance dosing 
Two maintenance dose regimens of 200 mg SC Q4W and 200 mg SC Q12W were evaluated in the 
Phase 2 Study AMAC. As expected, the Q12W regimen produced a concentration profile with greater 
difference between peak and trough concentrations over a dosing interval as compared to the Q4W 
regimen. Although the Q12W regimen produced moderate efficacy at Week 52 based on the binary 
efficacy measures, the mirikizumab concentration profile with the Q12W regimen did not maintain 
consistent symptomatic efficacy. On the other hand, the Q4W treatment group generally had a 
numerically greater treatment effect across the assessed clinical and histologic endpoints, and the 
effect in the Q4W group was more consistent than in the Q12W group. The Q4W regimen also 
produced trough concentrations that were similar to the Week 12 trough concentration produced in the 
200-mg IV induction cohort that achieved the best efficacy. 
Model-based and graphical examination of the relationship between mirikizumab exposure and clinical 
response, clinical remission, and MMS change at Week 52 during the maintenance period in the Phase 
2 Study AMAC did not reveal any significant relationships. Similar analyses were conducted at the end 
of the maintenance period of the Phase 3 maintenance Study AMBG, focused on patients that had 
achieved clinical response in the induction Phase 3 Study AMAN. The analysis found no significant 
relationship between mirikizumab exposure and Week 40 efficacy in the exposure range at the single 
dose level of 200 mg SC evaluated in Study AMBG. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 57/207 
 
Overall, the robust efficacy observed in the Phase 3 maintenance study AMBG and the E-R data for 
maintenance treatment indicate that maintenance efficacy was not sensitive to differences in exposure 
across patients with the 200 mg SC Q4W dosing regimen, demonstrating that this dose regimen 
provided maximal efficacy in UC patients. 
Exposure-Response Relationships for Safety 
Model-predicted average concentrations were determined for each patient in Studies AMAN and AMBG. 
Patients were stratified by quartile ranges of predicted average concentration. The number of patients 
reporting the following AEs of special interest was summarised for each exposure quartile: 
• 
injection site reactions (Study AMBG) and infusion site reactions (Study AMAN) 
• 
infections, serious infections, and opportunistic infections, and 
• 
hypersensitivity reactions (Figure 2.7.2.21). 
There was no apparent mirikizumab concentration relationship with any AEs of special interest 
evaluated in the exposure quartile analysis for either the induction Study AMAN or the maintenance 
Study AMBG.

Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
Assessment report

The bioanalytical methods have been appropriately validated and no issues are raised. 
Population PK Analyses 
Population PK analyses of Phase 3 data from Study AMAN alone and Studies AMAN plus AMBG were 
presented. In both analyses, typical monoclonal 2-compartment linear models (both absorption and 
clearance) best described mirikizumab concentration-time profiles. The AMAN plus AMBG model 
estimated systemic clearance to be 0.022 L/hr and SC bioavailability to be 47.6% (geomean: 44%; 
geoCV%: 34%). These estimates are consistent with results from the clinical trials in patients with UC, 
healthy subjects, and patients with psoriasis. 
There are no issues of concern for either popPK model. The final model parameters were estimated 
with good precision. Shrinkage was low for clearance and moderate for volume and bioavailability 
parameters. As such, individual post-hoc estimates can be considered reasonably reliable. The VPCs 
suggested that the final models fit the observed data well. However, variability appeared to be slightly 
overestimated for the AMAN/AMBG final model. 
Body weight and serum albumin concentrations were found to be significant patient covariates related 
to mirikizumab clearance, with higher body weights associated with higher clearance, and lower 
albumin concentrations associated with higher clearance. Baseline BMI was found to be related to SC 
bioavailability, with higher BMI values associated with lower SC bioavailability. No other covariates 
were identified to significantly affect the PK of mirikizumab. Simulations of mirikizumab exposure using 
the final model showed that changes in mirikizumab exposure related to changes in patient covariates 
were small relative to overall variability in exposure (see Special Populations for further discussion). 
Absorption 
Bioavailability 
The PK results were generally consistent across the 3 Phase 1 studies (AMAA, AMAD and AMBD), which 
were conducted in healthy subjects and patients with PsO. SC bioavailability was around 40%. The PK 
of mirikizumab appeared to be dose proportional. Mirikizumab serum concentrations followed a bi-
exponential decline following IV administration. The PK of mirikizumab following IV and SC doses were 
comparable between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. 
Overall, TE ADA were present in low-to-moderate frequencies across the Phase 1 trials and the 
presence of TE ADA had minimal apparent impact on PK. However, the small number of participants 
and the designs of these trials, do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn on the impact of ADA. 
Bioequivalence 
In Phase 3 studies, the solution formulation used for IV induction dosing (Mirikizumab Injection, 300 
mg/15 mL) and the solution formulation used for SC maintenance dosing (Mirikizumab Injection, 100 
mg/mL) is the same as the to-be-marketed formulation. Therefore, no bioequivalence study was 
needed. However, SC administration in the Phase 3 trials was only conducted with a PFS. Therefore, 
Study AMBD was necessary to show bioequivalence between the to-be-marketed autoinjector (AI) and 
PFS. 
The design and methodology of Study AMBD were acceptable. Bioequivalence following SC 
administration of mirikizumab between the AI and PFS was demonstrated as the 90% CI for the ratios 
of geometric LS means (AI:PFS) for AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-∞), and Cmax were entirely contained within 
the confidence limits of 0.8 and 1.25. There was no statistically significant difference in tmax. 
The results of an additional analysis in Study AMBD suggested that mirikizumab can be administered in 
the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh and achieve similar serum exposure regardless of anatomical 
injection location.

Distribution 
The relatively small volume of distribution of mirikizumab (4.83 L) is typical of monoclonal antibodies, 
which are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces due to their large molecular size and 
poor lipophilicity. 
Elimination 
No specific excretion or metabolism studies were conducted. This is acceptable because mirikizumab is 
a protein which is primarily cleared by proteolytic catabolism and broken down into small peptides and 
individual amino acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
It is agreed that mirikizumab exhibits dose proportional PK within the dose ranges studied. There is 
minimal accumulation of mirikizumab over time, which is expected given its half-life of ~10 days and 
the dosing interval of 4 weeks. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The PK of mirikizumab in patients with UC were determined in the PopPK analyses. The data from the 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies suggest that the PK of mirikizumab in patients with UC is similar to the PK 
in healthy subjects.  
Immunogenicity 
In the Phase 2 trial (AMAC), the incidence of treatment emergent ADA was 47.8% in patients with UC. 
Almost half of the mirikizumab-treated patients were NAb positive (45.6%). 
Across three Phase 3 studies of mirikizumab, immunogenicity incidence was relatively low (around 
20%) and the majority of TE ADAs were characterised as having neutralizing activity. According to the 
applicant, this is not unexpected as most ADAs target the complementarity-determining regions of any 
monoclonal antibody therapeutic. More important was the observed impact of high ADA titres leading 
to reduced mirikizumab exposure and reduced efficacy. However, most patients had no TE ADA or low 
titre TE ADA and the magnitude of their ADA titres decreased over time. Therefore, this is not 
considered to be a major concern. 
No clinically meaningful differences in the frequency of hypersensitivity events, injection site reactions 
and infusion site reactions were observed in TE ADA positive patients compared with TE ADA negative 
patients. 
Overall, it is agreed that mirikizumab has an acceptable immunogenicity profile. 
Special populations 
Overall, the changes in mirikizumab PK and exposures relative to patient factors are consistent with 
expectations for a mAb. There was no apparent impact of renal or hepatic function, gender, age and 
race on mirikizumab PK in the popPK analyses. 
Significant covariates included body weight (CL/V), albumin (CL) and BMI (bioavailability). However, 
the applicant showed that the magnitude of the changes in exposure related to these patient factors 
were small relative to the overall range of exposures caused by random unexplained variability. 
Further, the E-R analyses indicated that efficacy and safety of mirikizumab were generally not sensitive 
to the variations in exposure observed across individuals at the dose levels that were studied in 
Studies AMAN and AMBG.  
Therefore, it is agreed that dose adjustments of mirikizumab due to patient factors are not warranted.

Interactions 
Mirikizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is unlikely to have any direct effect on drug-metabolizing 
enzymes. However, chronic inflammation may lead to disease-drug interactions by reducing the 
expression and activity of some CYP enzymes.  
Study AMBP evaluated the effects of multiple 250-mg subcutaneous doses of mirikizumab on the PK of 
a drug cocktail of CYP substrates in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The study design and 
methodology is considered acceptable. The results showed that multiple SC doses or mirikizumab are 
unlikely to change CYP activity in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to a degree that would be 
expected to contribute to clinically meaningful changes in the exposure of CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
CYP2C19, or CYP1A2 substrates. An adequate justification for the extrapolation of the results of Study 
AMBP to patients with UC was provided. 
As anticipated, concomitant drugs did not have a significant impact on mirikizumab PK since 
mirikizumab is not eliminated intact in the urine or metabolised by CYP450 enzymes. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Mirikizumab binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23), a naturally occurring pro-inflammatory 
cytokine, and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R). The proposed mechanism of 
action supports the selection of PD biomarkers investigated in the clinical studies. 
Primary pharmacology 
The results from PD evaluations in the clinical studies provide support for the proposed mechanism of 
action of mirikizumab in the treatment of patients with UC. 
Secondary pharmacology 
The lack of formal secondary PD studies is acceptable. Monoclonal antibodies such as mirikizumab have 
a very low likelihood for ion channel interactions and therefore thorough QT/QTc studies are not 
generally needed.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No PD interaction studies were conducted. This is not unusual in clinical developments of monoclonal 
antibodies and is based on the argument that they are specific for their ligand(s) and unbound 
molecules are rapidly degraded into pharmacologically inactive peptides and amino acids. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Efficacy  
Induction dosing: 
Based on Phase 2 data, response tended to increase with exposure up to the 200 mg cohort and then 
either plateau or decrease at higher exposures. Model-based exposure-efficacy analyses of Study 
AMAN found prior biologic experience to reduce the placebo effect, thus, decreasing the predicted 
efficacy rates for both the placebo and mirikizumab patients. No covariates were found to have an 
impact on the mirikizumab effect parameters in any of the efficacy models. 
The developed E-R model predicted 300 mg Q4W IV to produce 87% of the maximal effect possible 
with mirikizumab. It is agreed that it seems unlikely that efficacy would further increase above the 300 
mg and then sharply decrease before getting to 600 mg since the overall E-R profile is relatively flat 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 63/207 
 
over a wide exposure range. The efficacy of the 300 mg Q4W IV induction dose was confirmed in Phase 
3 study AMAN.  
Maintenance dosing: 
2 SC doses evaluated – 200 mg Q4W or Q12W; Q12W dose produced moderate efficacy at week 52 it 
did not maintain consistent symptomatic efficacy due to greater difference between peaks and troughs. 
Q4W dosing achieved best efficacy and produced trough similar to week 12 after induction dosing. 
Analyses support 200 mg Q4W SC for maintenance dosing in UC. 
Model-based exposure-efficacy analyses of Study AMBG found clinical remission at the end of induction 
to be a significant predictor of the placebo effect parameters at the end of maintenance treatment at 
Week 40, where patients that had achieved clinical remission after induction treatment having higher 
efficacy at the end of maintenance treatment. No covariates were found to have an impact on the 
mirikizumab effect parameters in any of the efficacy models for Study AMBG, and mirikizumab 
exposure was not a significant predictor of efficacy in these models with the dose regimens that were 
evaluated. 
Two, not mutually exclusive hypotheses were offered to explain the apparent lack of concentration–
effect relationships:  
1. Most of the concentrations were on the plateau of the concentration-effect curve.  
2. Disease-related patient factors at baseline control the clinical outcome. Compared to these factors, 
mirikizumab concentration differences among patients have a small effect. None of the patient-related 
factors have a strong predictive effect alone and the Phase III studies were not powered to show 
numerous weak effects. 
In fact, strong evidence for confounded exposure-efficacy relationships was found when analysing and 
comparing data from Studies AMAC, AMAN, and AMBG, showing that there are patient factors that 
exaggerate the steepness of the observed exposure-efficacy relationships. This suggests that data 
from a single dose level study and using any form of grouping based on exposure or model based 
analyses of individual patient data cannot be used to understand the true cause-effect relationships or 
predict the efficacy that would have been achieved at different dose levels. 
Safety 
E-R for safety was explored for AEs of special interest up to Week 12 and Week 40 – injection site 
reactions; infections; hypersensitivity reactions. No apparent relationship. There was no apparent 
mirikizumab concentration relationship with any AEs of special interest evaluated for either the 
induction Study AMAN or the maintenance Study AMBG.

Title 
A Phase 2, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Study of LY3074828 in 
Subjects with Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis (I6T-MC-AMAC). 
Design 
The purpose of Study I6T-MC-AMAC (AMAC) was to test the hypothesis that mirikizumab, compared to 
placebo, can induce significantly higher rates of clinical remission in patients with moderate-to-severe 
UC.  Study AMAC includes 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with mirikizumab or placebo (i.e., 
Induction period), followed by two 92-week periods: 
• 
Maintenance period to evaluate long-term safety and durability of clinical response and 
remission in patients who achieved clinical response at Week 12, or 
• 
Extension period to explore the effect of additional dosing on clinical response in patients who 
did not achieve clinical response at Week 12. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 65/207 
 
 
The design of the study is acceptable. The applicant has clarified how blinding was maintained in the 
induction period for patients receiving dose adjustments in the 50mg and 100mg arms of the trial. 
The applicant has also clarified the rationale for the choice of the doses used in the maintenance 
phase, (mirikizumab SC 200 mg Q4W and mirikizumab SC 200 mg Q12W. 
Study participants 
The study population included male or female patients between 18 and 75 years of age who 
• 
had a diagnosis of UC for ≥3 months before baseline 
• 
had moderately-to-severely active UC, as defined by a MMS score of 6 to 12 with an 
endoscopic subscore ≥2 within 14 days before the first dose of study drug, and 
• 
had evidence of UC extending proximal to the rectum. 
The study population either 
• 
had received treatment with 1 or more biologic agents with or without documented history of 
failure to respond or tolerate such treatment, or were naïve to biologic therapy and had at 
least 1 of the following: 
o 
an inadequate response or failure to tolerate current treatment with oral or IV 
corticosteroids or immunomodulators, or 
o 
a history of corticosteroid dependence. 
 
Treatments: 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 66/207 
 
In the induction phase, patients were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to; 
• 
mirikizumab intravenous (IV) 600 mg (fixed dosing) 
• 
mirikizumab IV 200 mg (exposure-based [EB] dosing) 
• 
mirikizumab IV 50 mg (EB dosing), or 
• 
placebo IV. 
Patients received study drug at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. 
Patients who received mirikizumab in the induction period and achieved remission were re-randomised 
to 
• 
mirikizumab SC 200 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), or 
• 
mirikizumab SC 200 mg every 12 weeks (Q12W). 
Patients who received placebo in the induction period received SC placebo Q4W. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with mirikizumab is 
superior to placebo in inducing clinical remission at Week 12 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. 
Clinical remission is defined as having achieved the following: 
• 
Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, 
• 
Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 (with 1-point decrease from baseline), and 
Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 
Supportive secondary efficacy safety and PK endpoints were also assessed. 
Participant flow  
A total of 249 patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups as the ITT Population. One patient 
in the mirikizumab IV 600 mg treatment group was randomised but never treated with study drug. 
A total of 238 patients (95.6%) completed the Induction Period.  Ten patients (4%) discontinued 
during the Induction period.

Overall, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups, although there was a 
considerable amount of variability in the incidence of medication use across the 4 groups. This has 
however not produced any obvious confounding effects on the outcome of the trial. 
Results 
The primary outcome of this trial was clinical remission at Week 12. 
There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission at 
Week 12 between either the mirikizumab IV 600 mg or 50 mg EB treatment groups and the placebo 
group. 
As the primary outcome was not met, no control for multiplicity was carried out for any of the other 
outcomes. Consequently, these results should be treated as indicative only.

Maintenance Period 
Patients who achieved clinical response at Week 12 entered the blinded maintenance period. Patients 
who received mirikizumab in the induction period were re-randomised to either mirikizumab SC 200 
mg Q4W, or mirikizumab SC 200 mg Q12W. 
Patients who received placebo in the induction period received SC placebo Q4W. 
Statistical comparisons were performed between each of the mirikizumab treatment groups. There 
were no statistical comparisons between either of the mirikizumab treatment groups and the placebo 
group. The inclusion of the placebo group was only intended to maintain the blind during the 
maintenance period of the study. 
Overall, there were no significant differences between the main secondary endpoints related to the

Title of study 
Induction study:  
A Phase 3, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-Blind, Parallel, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study of 
Mirikizumab in Conventional-Failed and Biologic-Failed Patients with Moderately to Severely Active 
Ulcerative Colitis. (I6T-MC-AMAN). 
Maintenance study 
A Phase 3, Multicentre, Randomised, Double-blind, Parallel-arm, Placebo-controlled Maintenance Study 
of Mirikizumab in Patients with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis LUCENT 2: 6T-MC-
AMBG 
 
Methods 
Study AMAN was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-controlled study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab, compared with placebo, over a 12-week 
Induction period. The study population included patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis (UC) who had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or are intolerant to conventional 
(nonbiologic) therapy for UC (conventional-failed), and those who had an inadequate response to, 
loss of response to, or are intolerant to biologic therapy for UC (biologic-failed).

Induction period (Week 0 to Week 12): After a 4-week Screening period, at Visit 2 (Week 0), 
patients were randomised 3:1 to receive blinded intravenous (IV) administration of 300 mg 
mirikizumab or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) with stratification based on • biologic-failed status 
(yes/no) • baseline corticosteroid use (yes/no) • baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score 
[MMS]: [4-6] or [7-9]), and • geographic region (North America/Europe/Other). 
 
Post-treatment follow-up period (16 weeks): At the end of Week 12 of the Induction period, 
patients could either • enter Study I6T-MC-AMBG (Study AMBG), a separate maintenance study of 
mirikizumab, or • discontinue study treatment and complete the post-treatment follow-up period. 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) had limited impact on the conduct of Study AMAN. Mitigations 
or adjustments were required for a small number of patients during the trial. Operational delays due 
to COVID-19-related site closures, delayed or missed participant visits and database lock were noted. 
 
Stratification factors: patients were stratified according to the following factors 
 
Biologic- or JAKi-failed status 
Baseline corticosteroid use 
Baseline disease activity, and 
Region (North America, Europe, or Other) 
 
Study AMBG was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm 
study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 200 mg mirikizumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) subcutaneous 
(SC) in maintaining treatment response at Week 40 (that is, at Week 52 of continuous study drug 
treatment). This study was conducted at 368 centres that entered 1178 participants.

Patients who achieved clinical response with blinded mirikizumab treatment during Study AMAN were 
randomised 2:1 to blinded 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC or blinded placebo. 
 
Patients who responded to blinded placebo in their induction study remained on blinded placebo in 
Study AMBG. Open-label rescue therapy with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W intravenously (IV) was 
administered for 3 doses if these patients lost response. 
 
Patients who did not achieve clinical response with either blinded mirikizumab or blinded placebo 
during Study AMAN received open-label extended induction therapy with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W IV 
administered for 3 doses.  
 
Patients who achieved delayed clinical response (defined using induction study baseline) received 
open-label 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC. 
 
Induction study non responders who did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 of Study AMBG were 
discontinued. Patients who completed Study AMBG were eligible for extension Study I6T-MC-AMAP 
(AMAP).

Sample size 
The applicant assumed that 90% of patients complete Study AMAN (which is expected to randomise 
approximately 1160 patients), anticipated that approximately 1044 patients will enrol in Study AMBG.  
It was expected that approximately 459 of these patients would enter Study AMBG as clinical 
responders to mirikizumab and then will be randomised 2:1 to 200 mg mirikizumab SC (306 patients) 
and placebo (153 patients). Among the approximately 459 mirikizumab clinical responders, 
approximately 169 mirikizumab clinical remitters will be randomised to 200 mg mirikizumab SC (113 
patients) and placebo (56 patients).  
This assumed that: 
The induction study (AMAN, which has a mixed population with approximately 60% biologic-failed 
patients) is expected to have an overall clinical remission rate of 21.6% and response rate of 58.6% 
with mirikizumab. 
75% of induction patients receive treatment with mirikizumab, based on a 3:1 randomisation ratio for 
the induction study. 
10% dropout rate from induction to maintenance. 
The primary endpoint, maintenance of clinical remission, was to be assessed on patients who achieved 
remission to mirikizumab induction treatment. Assuming mirikizumab and placebo maintenance of 
clinical remission rates of 58.4% and 23.6%, respectively (biologic-failed patients: 44% and 13%; 
conventional-failed patients: 70% and 32%), this study based on the 169 mirikizumab induction 
remitters is expected to have >90% power to demonstrate that mirikizumab is superior to placebo by 
using a chi-square test with a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. This sample size also provides 80% 
power to evaluate clinical remission among induction remitters in the subgroup of biologic-failed 
patients. In addition, 459 mirikizumab induction clinical responders are expected to provide adequate 
power (>80%) to demonstrate that mirikizumab is superior to placebo for the major secondary 
endpoints (clinical remission, endoscopic remission, or corticosteroid-free remission) at Week 40, 
among responders to mirikizumab induction treatment by using a chi-square test with a 2-sided 0.05 
significant level.

Statistical methods 
For both induction and maintenance trials, the statistical methods were appropriate. The populations 
for analyses were mITT; for both AMAN and AMBG: All randomised patients who received any amount 
of study treatment excluding patients impacted by the eCOA transcription error in Poland and Turkey 
(regardless, if the patient does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does not follow the 
protocol);  
The statistical analyses methods for the primary efficacy endpoints were based on CMH tests, which 
are appropriate. Secondary endpoint analyses included the use of MMRM methods which required 
justification in terms of the missing at random assumptions. In Study AMAN, the family-wise type 1 
error rates were controlled at a 2-sided alpha level of .00125 for the primary and all major secondary 
endpoints. The rationale for this alpha level was to demonstrate substantial evidence for the efficacy of 
mirikizumab within the single induction trial design. The graphical testing scheme for Study AMAN is 
presented.

Analysis Considerations for Efficacy Analyses Related to COVID-19 Mitigations 
 
Description and impact of eCOA transcription error 
Studies AMAN and AMBG used an eCOA device to record the PRO measures of SF and RB. 
When the study was ongoing, the applicant noted that in Study AMAN the eCOA devices for patient 
daily diary assessment of RB and SF Mayo subscores initially contained errors in the wording in 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 87/207 
 
answers to questions for patients in Poland and Turkey, respectively. RB scores in Poland and SF 
scores in Turkey in Study AMAN were therefore not accurately reported by patients on the eCOA 
devices. 
Data from patients who were randomly assigned to Study AMAN on the basis of these erroneous 
entries could not be accurately used in the study as baseline assessment of these PROs as well as for 
assessment of efficacy postbaseline. These impacted patients in Poland and Turkey were excluded from 
primary efficacy analyses (but included in safety analyses). 
The applicant considered these eCOA errors as important protocol deviations and they are reported in 
the Study AMAN CSR and Study AMBG CSR. 
 
Addressing the eCOA transcription error 
The applicant originally intended to randomly assign 1160 patients in study AMAN. To compensate for 
the 118 patients lost to the eCOA transcription error, additional patients were randomly assigned so 
that study power was maintained. Lilly aimed to enrol an additional 118 patients. A total of 121 
additional patients were actually enrolled. 
Data from patients impacted by the eCOA transcription error were excluded from the primary efficacy 
analysis but included in the primary safety analysis. The impact of removing these patients was 
assessed in a sensitivity analysis.

Baseline data 
Study AMAN 
 
Overall, at baseline of study AMAN, patients in the mITT population had a mean (SD) age of 42.5 
(13.9) years and were more likely to be male (59.8%). The majority of patients were White.  Mean 
(SD) duration of disease was 7.1 (6.8) years, and 38.2% of patients had a disease duration of 7 years 
or more. Patients had a mean (SD) MMS of 6.5 (1.3), with 53.2% of patients in the severe disease 
category (MMS 7 to 9) and 66.7% had severe UC, defined by an Mayo ES of 3. 
Demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups.

Summary of Demographic Characteristics, mITT Population, Study AMAN 
 
 
Disposition 
Of the mITT population, 258 (87.8%) in the placebo group and 835 (96.2%) in the mirikizumab group 
completed the study. The most frequently stated reason for study discontinuation was due to AE in 
both placebo (n = 23; 7.8%) and mirikizumab (n = 15; 1.7%) groups. 
 
 
Study AMBG 
 
The mITT population comprised 1073 patients. 
Of the 1073 patients, 544 were responders to mirikizumab induction, the cohort evaluated for the 
primary and major secondary objectives. Of these 544 responders to mirikizumab induction, 35% of 
patients had failed 1 or more prior biologic or JAKi therapy.

Outcomes and estimation 
Results of Primary and Major Secondary Endpoints Modified Intent-to-Treat Population 
Study I6T-MC-AMAN 
  
Mirikizumab demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy across clinical, symptomatic, and endoscopic 
endpoints both in patients who were naive to biologic and JAKi therapy, and in patients who had failed 
at least 1 biologic or JAKi therapy. 
 
Health-Related Quality of Life 
 
IBDQ total score 
Patients enrolled in the Phase 3 mirikizumab UC programme had a mean IBDQ total baseline score of 
130.5 out of 224, indicating substantial impact on the 4 domains of bowel symptoms, systemic 
symptoms, emotional function, and social function. 
 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group showed a nominally significantly greater LSM 
improvement in IBDQ total score at Week 12 compared with the placebo group: 38.4 in the 
mirikizumab group compared with 25.2 in the placebo group (LSM difference = 13.2; p<.001). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 93/207 
 
 
At Week 12, over half of the total number of patients treated with mirikizumab (57.5%) achieved IBDQ 
remission. In comparison, only 39.8% of patients in the placebo group achieved IBDQ remission 
(common risk difference = 18.1%; p<.001). 
 
EQ-5D-5L VAS score 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group showed a nominally significantly greater LSM 
improvement in EQ-5D-5L score at Week 12, compared with the placebo group: 14.6 in the 
mirikizumab group compared with 9.4 in the placebo group (LSM difference = 5.2; p<.001). 
 
C-reactive protein in all mITT patients 
Patients enrolled in the Phase 3 mirikizumab UC programme had mean and median CRP levels at 
baseline of 9.4 mg/L and 4.1 mg/L, respectively. 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group showed a nominally significantly greater LSM reduction in 
CRP from baseline at Week 12 compared with the placebo group: -4.6 mg/L in the mirikizumab group 
compared with -0.9 mg/L in the placebo group (LSM difference = -3.7; p<.001) 
 
Fecal calprotectin in mITT patients with a baseline value over 250 mg/kg  
Among patients with a baseline fecal calprotectin level over 250 mg/kg, a post hoc analysis noted that 
34.3% of those in the mirikizumab group had a fecal calprotectin level at Week 12 of 250 mg/kg or 
less, compared with 20.1% in the placebo group (common risk difference = 14.6%; p<.001)

Health-Related Quality of Life 
IBDQ total score 
At Week 40 of Study AMBG, patients in the mirikizumab treatment group who responded to 
mirikizumab in Study AMAN sustained a nominally significantly greater LSM improvement from Week 0 
of Study AMAN on the IBDQ total score compared with the placebo group: 49.8 in the mirikizumab 
group compared with 24.5 in the group of patients withdrawn from mirikizumab treatment (LSM 
difference = 25.2; p<.001). 
At Week 40 of the study, 72.3% of patients in the mirikizumab group responded to mirikizumab in 
Study AMAN compared with 43.0% in the placebo group who achieved IBDQ remission (common risk 
difference = 28.5%; p<.001) 
EQ-5D-5L VAS score 
Patients in the mirikizumab treatment group who responded to mirikizumab in Study AMAN showed a 
nominally significantly greater LSM improvement in EQ-5D-5L VAS score from Week 0 of Study AMAN 
at Week 40 of Study AMBG, compared with the placebo group: 20.1 in the mirikizumab group 
compared with 8.8 in the placebo group (LSM difference = 11.3; p<.001) 
C-reactive protein in all mITT patients 
At Week 40 of Study AMBG, patients in the mirikizumab treatment group who responded to 
mirikizumab in Study AMAN showed a nominally significantly greater LSM reduction in CRP from 
baseline (Week 0 of Study AMAN), compared with patients who were randomly assigned to withdrawal 
from mirikizumab (randomly assigned to placebo) at Week 0 of Study AMBG: - 4.7 mg/L in the 
mirikizumab group compared with -1.4 mg/L in the placebo group (LSM difference = -3.3; p<.001) 
Fecal calprotectin in mITT patients with a baseline value over 250 mg/kg  
Among patients with a fecal calprotectin level over 250 mg/kg at baseline of Study AMAN, a post hoc 
analysis noted that 50.7% of those in the mirikizumab group had a fecal calprotectin level at Week 40 
of Study AMBG of 250 mg/kg or less, compared with 19.3% in the placebo group who were randomly 
assigned to withdrawal from mirikizumab (randomly assigned to placebo) at Week 0 of Study AMBG 
(common risk difference = 29.1%; p<.001)

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The mirikizumab UC Phase 3 programme comprised 3 trials: 
 
• 
12-week induction Study I6TMC- AMAN (AMAN),  
• 
40-week maintenance Study 16T-MC-AMBG (AMBG),  
• 
long term extension Study I6T-MC-AMAP. 
 
A phase 2 dose finding study also provides some supportive evidence. 
 
As stated in the EMA Guideline (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the development of new 
medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis) “to fulfil a claim for the treatment of 
ulcerative colitis, it is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided. 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from CHMP (EMEA/H/SAH/079/1/2017/III) 22 June 2017. 
The advice was on the pre-clinical and clinical pharmacology and phase studies in UC and safety 
monitoring. The development mostly followed the advice however the applicant at that time proposed 
2 separate induction studies (AMAN) and (AMAO) both of which planned to enrol 408 patients and test 
two separate regimens in UC patients who failed or were intolerant to conventional or biological 
therapies. This is in line with the EMA Guideline (CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1 Guideline on the 
development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis) “to fulfil a claim for the 
treatment of ulcerative colitis, it is expected that at least two confirmatory trials are provided”. 
 
The applicant only conducted a single induction study (AMAN) however, this study enrolled more 
patients (1162) compared to the planned enrolment of 816 patients. This study was well powered, 
>90% power to demonstrate that mirikizumab is superior to placebo in achieving this endpoint, as 
assessed using a chi-square test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.00125.  
 
The applicant presented the results of a Phase 2 dose finding study (AMAC) in which 3 doses of 
mirikizumab were compared to placebo to assess the induction of endoscopic remission at Week 12 
following induction treatment. The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
treatment with mirikizumab is superior to placebo in inducing clinical remission at Week 12. The study 
was in principle well designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria assessment endpoints 
and while the method used for the calculation of the sample size seemed unusual, the numbers 
recruited to the study were sufficient to adequately power the study for the primary endpoint.  
 
The induction study (AMAN) consisted of a 4-week screening period, followed by a 12 week 
dosing period. Following this phase, patients could then enter the maintenance study AMBG, or post 
treatment follow up period of 16 weeks. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 118/207 
 
Patients were randomised 3:1 to receive blinded intravenous (IV) administration of 300 mg 
mirikizumab or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) with stratification based on • biologic-failed status 
(yes/no) • baseline corticosteroid use (yes/no) • baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score [MMS]: 
[4-6] or [7-9]), and • geographic region (North America/Europe/Other). 
There was no rescue arm in Study AMAN. However, patients who completed Study AMAN through 
Week 12 (with an acceptable safety profile) who did not achieve a clinical response to mirikizumab at 
Week 12 were eligible to receive an induction dose of mirikizumab in Study AMBG. 
 
The study (AMAN) enrolled patients who had an established diagnosis of UC of ≥3 months in duration 
before baseline (Week 0), which includes endoscopic evidence of UC and a histopathology report that 
supports a diagnosis of UC. They had moderately to severely active UC as defined by a modified Mayo 
score (MMS) of 4 to 9 with an endoscopic subscore (ES) ≥2, with endoscopy performed within 10 days 
before baseline. Both Male and female patients were enrolled and were aged 8 to 80 years old. 
It would have been preferred to have a definition of moderate and severe UC more in line with the EMA 
UC guideline, therefore the interchangeability with the full Mayo score should be demonstrated 
convincingly with a view on common clinical practice and external validity of trial results”. However, 
the applicant has reported the number and proportion of patients that fulfilled the full Mayo score 
definition (Mayo Score of 6 to 12 and endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3) at baseline and clarified that the 
results can be generalised also to these patients. 
 
Patients must have had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least a 
conventional treatment which included corticosteroids, immunomodulatory treatments (oral AZA, 6-MP 
or a combination of a thiopurine and allopurinol) or biological agents (such as anti- TNF antibodies or 
anti-integrin antibodies) or to Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (such as tofacitinib). Patients had to be on 
stable doses of oral 5-ASA therapy or steroids for at least 2 weeks before screening endoscopy. 
Patients receiving AZA, 6-MP, and methotrexate: were required to be on a stable dose for at least 8 
weeks before the screening. 
 
The primary endpoint used in the studies “clinical remission per adapted mayo score” is a composite 
endpoint evaluating symptoms and endoscopic features of UC, using 3 parts of the validated Mayo 
Score, however with exclusion of the physician global scale. To be a responder the patient should have 
had a stool frequency subscore (SF) =0, or SF =1 with a ≥1 point decrease from baseline and not 
greater than baseline, a rectal bleeding score (RB) of 0, and endoscopic subscore =0 or 1 (excluding 
friability).  
 
The composite endpoint utilised in this study is not fully in line with the EMA UC GL 
(CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 rev 1), which states that clinical (symptoms) and endoscopic remission 
should be evaluated as co-primary endpoints to ensure a beneficial effect over placebo in both parts. 
However similar endpoints have been accepted by CHMP in approved treatments for UC.  Furthermore, 
the composite primary endpoint was agreed by CHMP during the scientific advice with the condition 
that the individual components of the score were also tested and controlled for.  Additionally, the sub-
scoring levels chosen are consistent with the guideline, which states that a score of 0 or 1 may be used 
for defining endoscopic healing and symptomatic remission should include cessation of rectal bleeding. 
 
Two protocols were submitted one dated 13-Mar-2018 and an amended version (protocol a) dated 12-
Sep-2019. The endpoints listed in the version dated 12-Sep-2019 do not follow the same order as 
those stated in the SAP provided nor in the study report submitted for this trial. As the first key 
secondary endpoint alternate clinical response at week 12 was removed. This assessment report is 
presented in the order in which present in the SAP. Conduct of the study was stated to be in line with 
GCP. This trial was previously inspected by Belgian and French regulators, no critical issues were 
identified, however corrective actions were requested. 
 
The applicant utilised an eCOA device to electronically capture patient daily diary entries regarding PRO 
questions for SF and RB, which are components of the MMS. A transcription error (i.e., copy and paste 
error) in the eCOA devices in Turkey was reported to Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). Further investigation 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 119/207 
 
of the programming for the eCOA devices for all languages revealed a similar transcription error in 
Polish, and no other languages. As these were considered important errors by the applicant the 117 
impacted patients from Turkey and Poland, whose baseline data was collected using incorrectly 
transcribed PRO questions on the eCOA devices, were excluded from the primary efficacy analysis but 
included in the primary safety analysis.  
 
The statistical methods were in general acceptable. 
 
Study AMBG was a phase 3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal 
design, parallel-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 200 mg mirikizumab every 4 weeks 
(Q4W) subcutaneous (SC) in maintaining treatment response at Week 40 (that is, at Week 52 of 
continuous study drug treatment).   
 
There were 2 main cohorts, those who were responders from AMAN and the non-responders The 
responders from AMAN who had received Mirikizumab were re randomised to continue with 
mirikizumab at a lower dose of 200 mg Q4W or receive placebo blinded for 40 weeks.  This is the main 
aspect of the efficacy analysis and was controlled for. Any of the patients in the placebo or treatment 
arm who lost their response were treated open label with 300 mg Q4W. 
 
Patients entering into the study who were non responders were treated in open label with 300 mg q4w 
regimen for as long as they were achieving clinical benefit. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were in clinical remission at week 12 form 
AMAN study and maintained this at week 40. This is acceptable.  Key secondary endpoints included 
proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission and entered into the study with clinical response. 
Endoscopic remission, corticosteroid free remission without surgery and clinical remission at week 40 
in the subgroup of patients in whom biological treatments failed or were intolerant to.  Which are all 
accepted as clinically relevant. 
544 Patients responders from the preceding study AMAN were enrolled. 179 patients were randomised 
to placebo. 365 were randomised to Mirikizumab.  
There was a high compliance rate achieved in the study 88.8% completed treatment in Mirikizumab 
arm, whereas 60.9% completed in the placebo arm. 
There were a number of protocol amendments (covid related), and the majority these appeared 
acceptable. 
 
Similar to the AMAN study, Study AMBG utilised an eCOA device to electronically capture patient daily 
diary entries regarding PRO questions for SF and RB, which are components of the MMS. A 
transcription error (i.e., copy and paste error) in the eCOA devices in Turkey was reported to Lilly. 
Further investigation of the programming for the eCOA devices for all languages revealed a similar 
transcription error in Polish. 
 
Overall, 104 impacted patients from Turkey (4) and Poland (100), Sensitivity analyses for efficacy 
were performed on primary and selected key secondary endpoints at Week 40 by including impacted 
patients using the ITT population with the mNRI method. 
 
Furthermore, following completion of the pivotal trial clinical study report for the Study AMBG, it was 
identified that 6 sensitivity analyses (using mNRI) were not fully aligned with the final version of the 
SAP. The covariate of “treatment” was inadvertently omitted from the multiple imputation model in the 
mNRI sensitivity analyses of the primary and some major secondary endpoints as reported in the CSR. 
This was then amended by the applicant.  The applicant provided the primary efficacy and key 
secondary endpoint (endoscopic remission) results without this covariate; no meaningful differences 
were observed between the two analyses.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose finding 
 
The results of the dose finding study AMAC are somewhat ambiguous. The trial did not meet its 
primary objective as no statistically significant difference was seen in any of the treatment arms 
compared to placebo. There was a trend seen in the secondary endpoints towards higher efficacy in 
the two higher dose arms, but these results are inconsistent. However, it is accepted that the results of 
this study are intended to be indicative only. 
  
 
Patients who achieved remission in the induction phase were enrolled into the 52-week maintenance 
phase of the trial. Here, patients who had received induction doses of mirikizumab were randomised to 
receive maintenance mirikizumab treatment at two doses, either 200 mg Q4W or 200 mg Q12W, while 
patients who received placebo continued doing so. The results of this phase are indicative only, as the 
study was not designed to formally assess efficacy. However, it was seen that there was no difference 
in maintenance of remission between the two treatment arms, although as there was no comparison 
against the response in the placebo arm it is difficult to interpret this maintenance response.  
 
Overall, the trial has provided some information regarding efficacy in patients with UC, showing a 
possible trend towards increased efficacy in the higher doses selected, although the results are not 
pivotal.

Induction of efficacy 
The statistical results of the induction study (AMAN) were considered to be reasonably compelling in 
providing evidence of treatment effect.  
 
Sensitivity analysis for efficacy were performed on primary and selected key secondary endpoints by 
including impacted patients using the ITT population with mNRI multiple imputation method 117 
reports. These did not show any differences from the primary analysis. 
 
The baseline demographics in terms of age, gender, weight, and disease duration were well balanced 
between the cohorts. Also, the background disease severity (moderate and severe) was also well 
matched and background treatment.  
The primary endpoint clinical remission MMS for the entire population was achieved p=0.00006) risk 
difference from placebo 11.1, (99.857% CI:  3.2, 19.1). The applicant also tested the subgroups based 
on prior UC therapy these were statistically significant in the biologic and tofacitinib naive subgroup 
Risk Diff 15.1 (8.3, 21.9). Statistical significance was not demonstrated in the at least 1 biologic or 
tofacitinib failed subgroup (P=0.065) (Risk Diff 6.8 (0.5, 13.0) or in the more than 1 biologic or 
tofacitinib failed subgroup (P=0.149), (Risk Diff 7.6 (-0.3, 15.5) however trended positive for the 
mirikizumab-treatment group compared to the placebo.  
For endoscopic remission a significantly greater percentage of patients achieved endoscopic remission 
at Week 12 in the mirikizumab-treatment group compared placebo (p <0.00001) risk difference 15.4 
(99.857% CI; 6.3, 24.5). For the subgroups analysis based on prior UC therapy biologic and tofacitinib 
naive subgroup, endoscopic remission was significantly higher in the mirikizumab-treatment group 
compared to the placebo group (p<0.001). Risk diff 17.9 (95% CI 9.8, 25.9). Also, in the at least 1 
biologic or tofacitinib failed subgroup a significantly higher effect in the mirikizumab-treatment group 
compared to the placebo group was demonstrated (p = 0.001). Risk diff 13.4 (95% CI 6.4, 20.4). 
However, within the more than 1 biologic or tofacitinib failed subgroup, the response was numerically 
higher but not statistically significant (p = 0.123).  
For symptomatic remission a significantly greater percentage of patients achieved symptomatic 
remission at Weeks 4 and 12 in the mirikizumab-treatment group compared to the placebo group. At 
week 4; P =0.00064, risk diff was 9.2 (99.875% CI 1.4, 16.9) and at week 12 p< 0.00001 risk diff 
17.5 (99.875% CI 17.5 27.6). Statistical significance was seen in each subgroup p< 0.001. 
According to the definition of Clinical remission and the clinical response at Week 12, the change of 
mean SF and RB subscores seem to be clinically relevant in the mirikizumab group and are not far 
from clinical relevance in PBO group at Week 12. The difference between them is both statistically 
significant and clinically relevant.  
Mirikizumab also demonstrated statistically significance for histological improvement and histological 
remission at 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
In the induction study (Study AMAN), remarkably high response/remission rates were found for 
Primary efficacy endpoint (Clinical remission rate at W12) and for some Major secondary efficacy 
endpoints in the mITT population as well as in “Biologic and JAKi naïve” patients in the placebo group 
when compared to the response rates observed in the mirikizumab group. Response rates between 15-
50% in PBO group with response rates not higher than 70% in miri 300 mg group were observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 122/207 
 
Mirikizumab also demonstrated improvement on QoL scales a greater mean increase (improvement) 
from baseline in IBDQ total score (p< 0.001) compared to placebo for response and remission and 
improvement in EQ-5D-5L score (p<0.001). Analyses on the subgroups were provided in the 
responses.  
During the Induction period, 290 patients (98.6%) in the placebo group and 851 patients (98.0%) in 
the mirikizumab-treatment group were compliant with treatment (which was defined as missing no 
doses prior to discontinuing study treatment). 
The induction study AMAN overall met its primary and key secondary endpoints.  While there was no 
active comparator in this trial the clinical effect size is similar to other authorisations in UC. However, 
the effect size on the primary endpoint was relatively small. 
Also, while the study was not powered for individual prior UC treatment subgroups, a lower effect is 
seen in patients failing at least 1 biological treatment prior to entering into the study.  In the subgroup 
of patients who failed following more than 1 biological treatment statistical significance for some 
endpoints was not demonstrated.   
Additionally in patients who had used corticosteroids at baseline statistical significance was not in for 
clinical remission, endoscopic or symptomatic remission or for histologic-endoscopic improvement. 
For part of the intended indication the applicant was seeking a claim in patients who have failed, or 
were intolerant to Janus kinase inhibitors however, it seems that the only member of this class of 
medications investigated was tofacitinib. The number of patients who had failed tofacitinib alone at 
baseline was rather low (6 placebo, 34 mirikizumab). Further justification was required by the 
applicant to support this aspect of the indication in the day 120 LoQs. 
In addition, the applicant was seeking to include “(…), or, have medical contraindications to such 
therapies” in the indication statement. The applicant was asked to delete this text as any such 
statement is considered inappropriate in this section of the SmPC. The applicant was also asked to 
remove the reference to section 5.1 in the day 180 LoOI. 
All of these aspects have been addressed satisfactorily as the applicant agreed to amend the indication 
initially sought as follows: 
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy, or a biologic treatment or a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, or have medical 
contraindications to such therapies (see section 5.1). 
This is in line with the data from the development Programme as discussed above. 
Maintenance of efficacy 
Overall, the data from maintenance study AMBG demonstrated a statistically significant improvement 
in clinical response over time compared to placebo. The proportions of patients achieving clinical 
remission were:  49.9% in patients randomly assigned to 200 mg mirikizumab SC Q4W, and 25.1% in 
patients randomly assigned to placebo (common risk difference = 23.2%; p<.001). 
Also, the key secondary endpoints also demonstrated statistically significant better results compared to 
placebo over time. These included endoscopic remission at week 40 showed a risk difference (RD) 
28.5% P < 0.001, maintenance of clinical remission at Week 40 RD 24.8% p< 0.001. 
A significantly greater percentage of patients achieved corticosteroid-free remission without surgery at 
Week 40 in the mirikizumab-treatment group compared to the placebo group (p<0.001), histologic-
endoscopic mucosal remission (p<0.001), Bowel Movement Urgency NRS (p<0.001) AND Urgency 
Remission (Urgency NRS = 0 or 1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 123/207 
 
Subgroup analysis based on demographic, previous treatment, duration of disease etc demonstrated a 
consistent beneficial effect for both clinical remission and endoscopic improvement. The only variable 
in question is patients who are obese, BMI ≥ 30 and ≤ 40 kg/m2.  The lower limit crosses zero, 
however the number of patients was relatively low compared to the normal and overweight cohorts 
and patients with severe UC generally have lower BMI’s. 
The secondary endpoints were further supported by improvements in clinical remission in patients with 
or without steroids at baseline, abdominal pain and fatigue all p < 0.001. 
There was also a statistically significant difference for inflammatory biomarkers seen with treatment for 
both CRP and Faecal calprotectin with mirikizumab treatment compared to placebo. 
Health related outcomes: Among the mirikizumab induction responders at Week 40, patients in the 
mirikizumab-treatment group achieved a significantly greater (p<0.001) mean increase (improvement) 
from baseline in IBDQ total score, IBDQ response, IBDQ remission, compared to the placebo group. 
Also, mirikizumab-treatment group achieved a significantly greater improvement from baseline in EQ-
5D-5L VAS score, SF-36 PCS component score SF-36 MCS component score versus placebo. 
Of the 365 mirikizumab responders from Study AMAN randomly assigned to mirikizumab maintenance 
treatment, 19 (5.2%) experienced a loss of response during maintenance and received at least 1 dose 
of rescue therapy with open-label 300 mg mirikizumab IV Q4W for up to 3 doses. Of the rescued 
patients, 12 (63.2%) patients regained symptomatic response and 7 (36.8%) achieved Symptomatic 
Remission after 12 weeks of rescue therapy. These patients were treated in open label rescue and the 
efficacy data was not therefore controlled for type 1 error. The rescued patients who achieved a clinical 
response were then given 200mg Q4W.  Accordingly, the SmPC recommends considering a total of 3 
doses of 300mg intravenous infusion and, if clinical benefit is achieved to resume the maintenance 
dosing. Which is acceptable. 
The applicant has added a wording to the SmPC to recommend an additional 12 weeks’ treatment for 
patients who did not achieve induction remission. This is agreed however as it is unclear what 
percentage of these patients can then be maintained on 200 mg Q4W the SmPC now also clarifies that 
Mirikizumab should be discontinued if no therapeutic benefit to extended induction therapy materialises 
by week 24. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
Overall, the applicant has demonstrated through the clinical trials submitted that mirikizumab is an 
efficacious treatment for induction and maintenance of patients with UC in the proposed indication.  
2.6.8.  Clinical safety  
The main safety data supporting this MAA come from 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies in participants with UC: 
• 
I6T-MC-AMAN (AMAN), and 
• 
I6T-MC-AMBG (AMBG). 
Supportive safety data provide context to the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies, UC studies and includes safety 
data from the entire mirikizumab clinical development programme encompassing 11 studies: 
• 
4 studies in participants with moderately-to-severely active UC, including the 2 pivotal trials 
and the supportive

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure  
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
In the safety population that includes all participants who received 1 dose, there were 1281 
participants in the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. 
• 
322 placebo IV Q4W, and 
• 
959 mirikizumab 300 mg IV Q4W. 
The number and percentage of participants who completed 12 weeks of study treatment was 285 
(88.5%) placebo group participants, and 920 (95.9%) mirikizumab treatment participants. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
There were 581 participants in the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled 
Analysis Set 
• 
192 placebo SC Q4W, and 
• 
389 mirikizumab 200 mg SC Q4W. 
The number and percentage of participants who completed 40 weeks of study treatment was 
• 
119 (62.0%) placebo group participants, and 
347 (89.2%) mirikizumab treatment participants 
Overall exposure is based on the data from participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
during the mirikizumab clinical studies. The All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set, which includes 
all mirikizumab exposures in the UC clinical programs, includes 2250.9 total PYE and is of primary 
interest to characterise the safety profile of mirikizumab in UC. The All Mirikizumab Exposures 
Integrated Analysis Set, which includes all mirikizumab exposures across the UC, CD, and psoriasis 
clinical programs, includes a total of 7801.3 total PYE; the majority of this exposure to mirikizumab 
was accrued in patients with psoriasis.

Common AEs by SOC  
TEAEs within SOCs reported by more than 10% of the participants in either treatment group were 
infections and infestations and gastrointestinal disorders. 
A numerically higher percentage of mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo-treated 
participants reported a TEAE in the Infections and infestations SOC. Several PTs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC showed a higher frequency in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with 
placebo (nasopharyngitis, URTI, and rhinitis). The frequency of events reported in the Infections and 
infestations SOC may be due to the increased risk of infections in people with UC and people treated 
with immunomodulatory therapies such as mirikizumab. 
A numerically higher percentage of placebo group participants compared with mirikizumab treated 
participants reported a TEAE in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC. The most frequently reported TEAE 
in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC was UC. Notably, a higher frequency of participants in the placebo 
group reported a TEAE of UC compared with mirikizumab, clinically indicative of a lack of improvement 
of UC in the placebo group. There was a higher frequency of TEAEs reported from the Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders SOC in placebo group compared with the mirikizumab group due in large 
part to increased frequency of anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia. There was a higher frequency of 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders SOC in mirikizumab compared with placebo due to the 
numerical increase in several TEAEs within the Rash cluster.

TEAEs within SOCs reported by more than 10% of the participants in either treatment group were 
• 
Infections and infestations 
• 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
• 
General disorders and administration site conditions, 
• 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and 
• 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
In the General disorders and administration site conditions, a higher percentage of TEAEs were 
reported in mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo, with injection site pain being the 
most frequently reported TEAE in the mirikizumab-treatment group (4.4%). This may be due in part to 
the higher frequency of injection site pain and other injection site-related AE terms reported for 
mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo. In the Musculoskeletal disorders SOC, most 
events reported were arthralgia which contributed to the higher frequency of SOC Musculoskeletal 
disorders reported in mirikizumab compared with placebo. No other PTs reported contributed similarly. 
In the Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, a higher percentage of TEAEs were reported in 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 128/207 
 
mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo, with rash being the most frequently reported 
TEAE in the mirikizumab treatment group (3.6%). In Nervous system disorders, a higher percentage of 
TEAEs were reported in mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo, with headache being 
the most frequently reported TEAE in the mirikizumab treatment group (4.1%).  In Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders, a higher percentage of TEAEs were reported in mirikizumab-treated 
participants compared with placebo, with cough and oropharyngeal pain being the most frequently 
reported TEAEs in the mirikizumab treatment group (1.3% for both). 
In the Vascular disorders SOC, most reported events were hypertension, and these events contributed 
to the higher frequency reported for mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo. No other 
reported PTs contributed similarly. In the remaining SOCs reported more frequently in the mirikizumab 
treatment group compared with placebo, the numerical differences observed were evaluated and none 
of the others were considered clinically meaningful. 
Among those SOCs reported more frequently by the placebo group, the higher frequency of TEAEs 
reported in the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC for placebo compared with mirikizumab-treated 
participants was due in large part to the higher frequency of reported colitis ulcerative. 
This finding is similar to SOC evaluation of the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set and is 
considered clinically indicative of lack of improvement in the placebo group.

Common TEAEs are defined as events reported at a frequency of at least 1.0%, before rounding, of 
participants in the mirikizumab treatment group.

Table 10 TEAEs Occuring in at least 1% of Mirikizumab-Treated Participants by Decreasing 
Frequency UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the thorough review of summary and participant-level data of common TEAEs reported in the 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the TEAEs including headache, URTI, and fatigue were 
identified for further evaluation, as they were reported more frequently in the mirikizumab treatment 
group compared with the placebo group. Review of the other common TEAEs reported more frequently 
in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo did not indicate clinically meaningful 
differences including, but not limited to, the frequency, severity or pattern in the time-to-onset of the 
events. 
Headache was reported more frequently in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo. 
All headache events were mild or moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study treatment 
discontinuation. No pattern in the time-to-onset, duration of the events, or common underlying 
aetiology was observed. URTI was reported more frequently in the mirikizumab treatment group 
compared with placebo. Most URTIs were reported as mild in severity. No URTIs were serious or led to 
study treatment discontinuation.  
Fatigue was reported more frequently in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo. The 
majority of mirikizumab-treated participants reporting fatigue were non-responders to treatment at the 
end of Study AMAN. Most fatigue events were reported as mild in severity. One participant reported a 
severe TEAE of fatigue after developing facial swelling and erythema a few hours after the first infusion 
of study drug. No fatigue events were reported as serious or resulted in study treatment 
discontinuation. 
Anaemia, colitis ulcerative, and iron-deficiency anaemia were reported more frequently in the placebo 
group compared with the mirikizumab treatment group. These observed imbalances are clinically 
indicative of a lack of improvement of UC in the placebo group.

Based on thorough review of summary and participant-level data of common TEAEs reported in the UC 
Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the numerical imbalances 
between mirikizumab and placebo for TEAEs of headache, rash, injection site reaction, and 
oropharyngeal pain were  identified for further evaluation. Review of the other common TEAEs reported 
more frequently in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo did not indicate clinically 
meaningful differences in the frequency, severity, or pattern in the time-to-onset of the events. 
Headache 
Similar to the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, a higher frequency o mirikizumab-treated 
participants (4.1%) reported headache TEAEs compared with placebo participants (1.0%) in the UC 
Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. All headache events were 
reported as mild or moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study treatment 
discontinuation. No pattern in the time-to-onset, or duration of the events, or common underlying 
aetiology was observed.  
Rash 
An imbalance in the frequency of reported rash TEAEs in the mirikizumab-treated participants (3.6%) 
compared with placebo (0) was observed. All rash events were reported as mild or moderate. None 
were reported as serious or led to study treatment discontinuation. There was no apparent temporal 
relationship between mirikizumab administration and onset of rash, as event start ranged from Days 
30 to 250. No consistent duration in events was observed, as events lasted from Days 1 to 228.  
Injection site reaction (PT) 
Injection site reaction TEAEs were more frequently reported in mirikizumab-treated participants 
(2.6%) compared with placebo (0.5%). All injection site reaction events were reported as mild or 
moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study treatment discontinuation. Duration was 1 to 
9 days in the majority of participants. Six of the 10 mirikizumab participants with events reported an 
injection site reaction at more than 1 dosing visit.  
Oropharyngeal pain 
Oropharyngeal pain within the URTI cluster occurred notably more frequently in mirikizumab treated 
Participants’ (1.3%) compared with placebo (0.5%). 
Common AEs reported more frequently in placebo compared with mirikizumab 
The frequency of colitis ulcerative and anaemia remained higher in placebo compared with the 
mirikizumab treatment group, and this consistent finding in the UC Induction and UC Maintenance 
Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set is suggestive of the lack of improvement of UC 
in the placebo group.

UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
In the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set, the majority of common TEAEs were reported at a 
lower IR compared with the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set. 
TEAEs reported at a higher IR in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set compared with the UC 
Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set were colitis ulcerative, COVID-19, and upper respiratory 
tract infection. 
The higher IR for colitis ulcerative in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set likely reflects the 
inclusion of UC non-responders and participants with LOR who, based on their more active UC and 
refractory nature of their disease to treatment, would be expected to report colitis ulcerative TEAEs. 
 
The higher incidence rate for COVID-19 in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set is not 
unexpected in a participant population that includes UC non-responders and participants with LOR, as 
such participants may be at increased risk to develop an infection due to UC, comorbidities or 
concomitant UC medications. The higher incidence rate for COVID-19 may also be related to the 
ongoing spread of COVID-19 as the global pandemic matured and infected a greater proportion of the 
world’s population. 
A comparison of incidence rates of common TEAEs reported in the UC Treatment Regimen and All UC 
Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Sets demonstrates that longer duration of mirikizumab exposure in 
participants with UC does not increase the IR of these common TEAEs. The IR of the most common 
TEAEs appeared to be stable or decreased with continued exposure. The higher IR of colitis ulcerative, 
COVID-19, and upper respiratory tract infection TEAEs in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis 
Set likely reflects inclusion of participants with more severely active UC and the maturation of the 
COVID-19 global pandemic

The percentages of participants with TEAEs are summarised by treatment using the MedDRA PT nested 
within the predefined event clusters. Event clusters were defined by medical representatives after a 
blinded review of the MedDRA PTs reported by any participant in the safety population. PTs that are 
essentially synonymous and refer to the same clinical concept were grouped as a cluster.

Based on an evaluation of the individual PTs and the predefined clusters, there were 3 clusters where 
data supported a plausible association with mirikizumab treatment: 
• 
Upper respiratory tract infection 
• 
Rash, and 
• 
Headache. 
Upper respiratory tract infection cluster 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 136/207 
 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
There were no severe or serious TEAEs reported, and no participants discontinued mirikizumab 
treatment due to an AE within the Upper respiratory tract infection cluster. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
One mirikizumab-treated participant reported a severe URTI TEAE of nasopharyngitis. No SAEs were 
reported, and no participants discontinued study treatment due to an AE within the cluster. 
Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and oropharyngeal pain were reported more 
frequently as individual PTs compared to other events included in the cluster. 
Based on small but consistently higher frequency of events reported for mirikizumab-treated 
participants and the immunomodulatory mode of action of mirikizumab, there is biologic plausibility for 
an association between mirikizumab and the occurrence of URTI in the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled 
and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Analysis Sets. 
Rash cluster 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: All events reported within the Rash cluster were mild or 
moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study treatment discontinuation. No pattern in the 
time-to-onset or duration of the events was observed. None of the events occurred on a study drug 
dosing day (that is, none were immediate reactions). Ten mirikizumab participants had a past medical 
history of atopy, skin disorder, or food or drug hypersensitivity. Rash was reported as related to 
mirikizumab treatment by the investigator for 5 participants. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set: Rash was reported more 
frequently as an individual PT compared with other events included in the cluster. Within the Rash 
cluster, all events reported were mild or moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study 
treatment discontinuation. No pattern in the time-to-onset or duration of the events was observed. 
Seven participants had a past medical history of rash or a drug allergy/hypersensitivity to another 
medication. Four participants reported a rash in UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. Rash 
was reported as related to mirikizumab treatment by the investigator for 2 participants. While there 
was no distinct pattern in time-to-onset or duration of the rash events, the frequency of reports of rash 
notably increased in the mirikizumab-treated group during maintenance compared with induction with 
no increase in the placebo group. There is biologic plausibility for an association between the 
administration of mirikizumab and the occurrence of rash. Therefore, these observations were 
considered clinically meaningful. 
Headache cluster 
UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
In the Headache cluster, the majority of events reported were headache, which contributed to the 
higher frequency of the Headache cluster reported in the mirikizumab group compared with placebo.  
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Maximum Severity 
In the UC clinical trials, severity of AEs was determined by the investigator based on their medical 
judgement. 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The frequency of severe TEAEs was higher in the placebo group than the mirikizumab treatment group. 
The Gastrointestinal disorders SOC had the highest frequency of severe events reported: 
• 
4.7% (n = 15) placebo, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 137/207 
 
• 
0.8% (n = 8) mirikizumab. 
Of the severe TEAEs reported within the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, a majority were colitis 
ulcerative (14 placebo; 6 mirikizumab). These observed imbalances are clinically indicative of more 
improvement of UC in the mirikizumab treatment group relative to the placebo group. 
The frequency of severe TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC was higher in the mirikizumab 
group (0.5%, n = 5) than the placebo group (0.3%, n = 1). There was no pattern in the type of severe 
infection TEAEs, as each PT was reported by 1 participant.

Controlled Analysis Set Severity, n (%) placebo IV Q4W 
  
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The frequency of severe TEAEs was higher in the placebo group than the mirikizumab treatment group. 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC was the most frequently reported severe SOC in the placebo group 
compared with mirikizumab: 
• 
3.1% (n = 6) placebo, and 
• 
0.8% (n = 3) mirikizumab. 
Similar to UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, most of the severe TEAEs reported with the 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC were colitis ulcerative (6, placebo; 2 mirikizumab). These observed 
imbalances are clinically indicative of more improvement of UC in the mirikizumab treatment group 
relative to the placebo group. The frequency of severe TEAEs in the General disorders and 
administration conditions SOC was higher in the mirikizumab group (0.5%, n = 2) than in the placebo 
group (0%). The 2 severe TEAEs reported were injection site pain. The frequency of severe TEAEs in 
the Infections and infestations SOC was similar in the placebo group (2.1%, n = 4) than in the 
mirikizumab treatment group (0.8%, n = 3). 
There were no other severe TEAE PTs reported in 2 or more participants in either the placebo or 
mirikizumab treatment groups.

The Gastrointestinal disorders SOC had the highest frequency of severe events reported among 
participants in the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab 
In the Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, the most frequently reported severe TEAE was colitis ulcerative. 
The frequency of participants reporting severe colitis ulcerative was

• 
1.9% in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set, and 
• 
0.7% in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set. 
These frequencies likely reflect the UC disease activity in the populations comprising the different 
analysis sets. The frequency of participants reporting severe TEAEs in the remaining SOCs was 
consistent with the placebo-controlled analysis set data and reflected the longer duration of exposure 
to mirikizumab in the UC Treatment Regimen

• 
0.3% (n = 1) placebo. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the hepatic disorders SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at 
least 1 TE hepatic disorder was 
• 
2.1% (n = 4) placebo, and 
• 
3.1% (n = 12) mirikizumab. 
In the placebo group, each hepatic event was reported for 1 participant (0.5%). In the mirikizumab 
treatment group, the most frequently reported TE hepatic disorders were 
ALT increased and GGT increased: 
• 
0.5% (n = 1) placebo, and 
• 
1.0% (n = 4) mirikizumab. 
The frequency of hepatic TEAEs (narrow terms) was similar between the placebo and mirikizumab 
treatment groups and was also similar between treatments for broad and narrow scope terms 
combined. 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
The IRs of TE hepatic disorders in the UC Treatment Regimen and All UC Mirikizumab Integrated 
Analysis Sets did not suggest an increase in hepatic AEs with increased exposure and duration of 
treatment. 
In the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 3 TEAEs of drug induced liver injury were 
reported in the Hepatobiliary disorders SOC in participants with psoriasis. Two of the events were 
related to treatment with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis and were moderate in severity. In 1 
participant, ALT was elevated to ≥5xULN and in the other, ALT was increased to ≥10xULN. 
One participant with baseline dyslipidaemia, hepatic steatosis, and alcohol use had ALT elevation to 
6.49xULN and AST elevation to 3.22xULN fourteen days after the first dose of mirkizumab (250 mg SC 
Q4W). Although, the patient had no liver-related symptoms, the event was reported as DILI of 
moderate severity. ALT and AST improved without discontinuation of mirkizumab. On Day 40, a second 
event of DILI (mild in severity) was reported with ALT 1.67xULN and AST 0.92xULN. Thereafter, ALT 
and AST fluctuated between normal and 1.5xULN without discontinuation of mirkizumab and 
normalised on Day 334 only to fluctuate again between below normal and 2xULN while continuing 
mirkizumab treatment. Although the elevations were possibly related to mirikizumab, the Lilly internal 
assessment was that these changes were consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and that 
alcohol, cefaclor, tramadol, and acetaminophen (administered for an upper respiratory infection) may 
have contributed to the elevations.

and AST) UC Placebo group, UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, All Placebo group, 
and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets 
  
Interpretation of the exposure-adjusted IRs for laboratory changes are influenced by differences in the 
frequency of sample collection during the induction Study AMAN, the maintenance Study AMBG, and 
the long-term extension Study AMAP. 
Frequency and incidence rate 
The frequency and IRs of ALT or AST shifts to ≥3x and, ≥5xULN in the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC 
Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets did not show an increase in 
clinically relevant changes in ALT or AST compared with the UC Placebo and All Placebo treatment 
groups over longer duration of treatment. 
The frequencies and IRs of ALT or AST shifts to ≥10xULN in the All UC Mirikizumab (0.2%, IR 0.1; 
0.1%, IR 0.1) and All Mirikizumab Exposures (0.2%, IR 0.1) Integrated Analysis Sets were low. No 
participants in the UC Placebo or All Placebo group had ALT or AST elevations to ≥10xULN, although the 
lower sample size, limited duration of treatment, and few PYE for the UC Placebo and All Placebo 
participants may have contributed to fewer events detected. 
Infections and Opportunistic Infections 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the infections SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE 
infection was 14.0% (n = 45) in placebo, and 15.1% (n = 145) in mirikizumab. In the placebo and 
mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE infection was nasopharyngitis 3.1% (n 
= 10) in placebo, and 4.1% (n = 39) in mirikizumab. The frequency of reported TE infections was 
similar between the placebo and mirikizumab treatment groups. 
Assessment report

UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the infections SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at least TE 
infection was 22.9% (n = 44) in placebo, and 23.9% (n = 93) in mirikizumab. In the placebo and 
mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE infection was nasopharyngitis: 5.7% (n 
= 11) in placebo, and 7.2% (n = 28) in mirikizumab. 
All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set 
There was a transient increase in TE infections at Week 156. All participants who reported TE infections 
at Week 156 were in Study AMAP after having completed Study AMAC. The majority of these events 
were mild, and there was no pattern 
observed in the types or duration of infections reported. All participants recovered from their infection, 
and none of these infections resulted in discontinuation of mirikizumab 
Opportunistic infections 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the OIs SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE 
opportunistic infection was0.3% (n = 1) in placebo (1 HZ), and 0.5% (n = 5) in mirikizumab (1 
oesophageal candidiasis, 2 cytomegalovirus colitis, 1 HZ, 1 intestinal tuberculosis). One participant 
(0.1%) in the mirikizumab treatment group reported cytomegalovirus colitis as a SAE.  
Overall, the frequency of reported TE opportunistic infections was low in the placebo and mirikizumab 
treatment groups, although the majority of reported opportunistic infections were in the mirikizumab 
treatment group. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the OIs SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE 
opportunistic infection was 0 in placebo, and 1.3% (n = 5) in mirikizumab. The 5 OIs reported in the 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set were oral candidiasis (n=1) 
mirikizumab and HZ 1.0% (n=4) mirikizumab. 
The frequency of TE OIs was low in the mirikizumab treatment group, with HZ reported as severe in 1 
mirikizumab-treated participant. All other OIs were reported as mild to moderate in severity, and none 
resulted in discontinuation of mirikizumab. 
Serious Infections 
The frequencies of serious infections were low and similar between the UC Induction (n = 7, 0.7%) and 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets (n = 3, 0.8%), and did not 
demonstrate a clinically meaningful difference between mirikizumab treatment and placebo. 
The IRs of serious infections in the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab 
Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets were comparable to the Induction and Maintenance Analysis Sets 
and did not suggest an increase in reports of serious infections with increased duration of treatment 
MACE

No TE MACE were reported in the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 144/207 
 
The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE MACE was 0.5% (n = 1) in placebo, and 0% 
in mirikizumab. The event was reported by the investigator as ischaemic stroke Cerebrovascular event 
(nonfatal stroke) in the placebo group. 
UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set 
No TE MACE were reported in the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set 
All UC Mirikizumab and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
The IR of TE MACE in the All UC Mirikizumab (0.2) and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis 
Set (0.3) were low although numerically higher compared to the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled and 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled, and UC Treatment Regimen Integrated 
Analysis Sets. 
The higher IR in the All Mirikizumab Exposures was related to the inclusion of psoriasis participants 
who have a higher risk and background IR for MACE (Gottlieb et al. 2014). In the placebo-controlled 
period of the mirikizumab psoriasis development programme, a numerical imbalance for MACE 
(placebo = 0; mirikizumab = 5; 0.4% [1.2 IR]) was observed. Across all treatment periods of the 
mirikizumab psoriasis development programme, 21 psoriasis participants reported TE MACE (2 
cardiovascular death, 14 nonfatal MI, and 6 nonfatal stroke). 
The MACE IR for the All Mirikizumab Exposures Analysis Set (0.3) was within published background IRs 
for each respective population and for other approved IL-23p19 inhibitors (0.2-0.6).

Participants in the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set only 
received SC administration of mirikizumab. Therefore, this dataset will not be included in the 
evaluation of infusion site reactions. 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Based on the Infusion site reaction HLT, the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE 
Infusion site reaction was 0.3% (n = 1) in placebo, and 0.4% (n = 4) in mirikizumab. In the placebo 
group, the reported TE Infusion site reaction (HLT) was infusion site paraesthesia. In the mirikizumab 
treatment group, the 4 reported TE Infusion site reactions (HLT) were infusion site erythema, infusion 
site pain infusion site paraesthesia, and infusion site pruritus. None of Infusion site reactions (HLT) 
were serious. No participants discontinued due to an Infusion site reaction (HLT).

Infusion site reactions (HLT) between the Integrated Analysis Sets were small and not considered 
clinically meaningful. None of Infusion site reactions (HLT) were serious. 
No participants with UC discontinued due to an Infusion site reaction (HLT). In the All Mirikizumab 
Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, the frequencies of discontinuations due to Infusion site reactions 
(HLT) was low and did not suggest an increase in the frequency of infusion site reaction-related events 
with increased duration of treatment.

TE Injection site reaction (HLT) was injection site pain (n = 6, 3.1%). In the mirikizumab treatment 
group, the most frequently reported TE Injection site reactions (HLT) were injection site pain (n = 17, 
4.4%) injection site reaction (n = 10, 2.6%), and injection site erythema (n = 8, 2.1%). In the 
mirikizumab treatment group, Injection site reactions (HLT) were predominantly mild or moderate in 
severity.

similar between TE ADA negative (8.3%) and TE ADA positive participants (10.2%) 
Treatment-Emergent Malignancies 
The incidence rates (IR) of all malignancies among patients with UC range from 0.33 to 1.34 per 
100PY, with some studies reporting UC to be associated with a significantly increased risk of 
malignancies (Karlén et al. 1999; Jussila et al. 2013; Jung et al. 2017; Burisch et al. 2022,), and other 
studies finding no significant association (Bernstein 2001a; Jess et al. 2013b; Biancone et al. 2016; 
van den Heuvel et al. 2016; So et al. 2017; Taborelli et al. 2020). The background incidence rates for 
selected relevant specific malignancies, associated with UC, were provided; colon, rectal, gastric, 
prostate, and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). 
The frequencies of TE malignancies were low and similar between the UC Induction and UC 
Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets and did not demonstrate a 
clinically meaningful difference between mirikizumab treatment and placebo. 
In the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC, a numerically higher frequency of TEAEs 
were reported with mirikizumab in the Study AMBG Extended Induction group (6 participants, 1.9%) 
compared with the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set (4 participants, 0.4%). The Extended 
Induction events included 1 event of gastric cancer in an Asian female with a family history of gastric 
and hepatic cancer and 5 different benign tumour types. Given the relatively short mirikizumab 
exposure preceding diagnosis, these benign and malignant neoplasms were likely pre-existing. 
The IRs of TE malignancies in the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set and the All UC 
Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set, were comparable to the Induction and Maintenance Analysis Sets 
and do not suggest an increase in the frequency of malignancy related events with increased duration 
of treatment.

In both the placebo group and mirikizumab treatment groups, the most frequently reported SAE was 
colitis ulcerative: 
3.1% (n = 10) placebo, and 
0.8% (n = 8) mirikizumab. 
 
 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
 
Overall, the frequency of SAEs was higher in the placebo group compared with the mirikizumab 
treatment group. 
The percentage of participants with at least 1 SAE reported was 7.8% (n = 15) placebo, and 3.3% (n 
= 13) mirikizumab. 
In the placebo group, the most frequently reported SAE was colitis ulcerative: 
3.1% (n = 6) placebo, and 0 mirikizumab. 
In the mirikizumab treatment group, all SAEs were single events reported for 1 participant (0.3%) 
each. One serious event of suicidal depression was reported, this event is discussed in the section 
below.  
 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
 
In general, the types of SAEs reported in the All UC Mirikizumab were similar to events reported in the 
placebo-controlled analysis sets, except for 2 SAEs reported, Kaposi’s sarcoma and ITP: 
 
A patient who was a mirikizumab induction non-responder with delayed clinical response had a colonic 
biopsy obtained during the Visit 4/Week 12 endoscopy that exhibited histologic changes consistent 
with Kaposi’s sarcoma. Last SC maintenance dose of mirikizumab prior to the diagnosis of Kaposi’s 
sarcoma occurred on the study Day 84. Human immunodeficiency virus testing at induction baseline 
and at the time of Kaposi’s sarcoma diagnosis was negative. No cutaneous lesions consistent with 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 152/207 
 
Kaposi’s sarcoma were identified during a dermatology consult. During the early termination visit on 
study Day 106, the participant withdrew consent and refused any post-treatment follow-up. The 
investigator was informed by the participant’s family that the participant died of COVID-19, 67 days 
after withdrawing consent and 5 months and 21 days after last dose of study drug. As the participant 
withdrew consent and later died, no further follow-up was possible. 
A patient (mirikizumab induction non-responder) with a history of ulcerative colitis since 2013 reported 
a SAE of immune thrombocytopenia on Study Day 14, approximately 14 days after his last dose of 300 
mg mirikizumab IV. Weak positive binding of IgG to platelets was detected using flow cytometry, which 
was not enhanced by the addition of mirikizumab. These results suggested the presence of a platelet-
reactive autoantibody in the participant’s serum that is not dependent on mirikizumab. Additional 
testing for immunoreactivity of the participant’s serum with a panel of platelet glycoproteins commonly 
associated with ITP were all negative. Although not definitive, given the above differential diagnosis, 
the laboratory results are overall most consistent with autoimmune ITP. The event was resolved 4 days 
after event onset and was assessed by the Investigator as related to the study drug. The participant 
discontinued from the study.

Blood Monocytes – Low 
 
Table 26 Shifts in Blood Monocytes UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab 
Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets 
 
 
 
In the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, 
while there was a greater mean decrease from baseline to last observation in blood monocytes in the 
mirikizumab treatment group compared with the placebo group, the magnitude of these changes was 
small. Furthermore, TE-low blood monocytes did not consistently occur more frequently in the 
mirikizumab-treated participants and were not associated with low monocyte or infection TEAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 153/207 
 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, among the 14 mirikizumab-treated participants 
with TE-low blood monocytes, there were no reported TEAEs associated with symptoms related to low 
blood monocytes. In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 
among the 7 mirikizumab-treated participants with TE-low blood monocytes, 1 participant on 
concomitant azathioprine reported a mild TEAE of monocyte count decreased. Taken together, the 
small decrease in mean blood monocytes with mirikizumab treatment is not considered clinically 
adverse.

Blood Segmented Neutrophils – Low 
 
Table 27 Shifts in Segmented Blood Neutrophils UC Induction and UC Maintenance 
Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets 
 
 
Induction dosing with mirikizumab resulted in a greater mean decrease in segmented neutrophil count 
and a higher frequency of TE-low segmented neutrophils in the mirikizumab treatment group. Although 
maintenance dosing with mirikizumab also demonstrated a greater mean decrease in neutrophils 
compared with placebo, the frequency of TE-low segmented neutrophils was similar between the 
mirikizumab treatment and placebo groups. 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, shifts to a higher grade of neutropenia were 
reported more frequently in the mirikizumab-treated participants, with most shifts being from Grade 0 
to 1. The frequency of shifts to Grade 2 or higher were similar between the mirikizumab treatment and 
placebo groups. In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, a 
similar proportion of mirikizumab and placebo participants had a shift to any higher grade of 
neutropenia. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 155/207 
 
In the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, 
infection-related TEAEs associated with shifts to any higher CTCAE grade occurred in a similar, small 
proportion of mirikizumab-treated and placebo participants. 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 1 mirikizumab-treated participant on concomitant 
azathioprine, who had a shift in neutrophil CTCAE grade from 0 to 1, was hospitalised with severe SAEs 
of klebsiella infection, colitis ulcerative, and, subsequently, listeria sepsis. 
In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 1 mirikizumab-treated 
participant reported an OI of oral candidiasis (not limited to the tongue) of mild severity. 
The type and severity of infections with shifts to neutropenia CTCAE Grade 2 or higher were consistent 
with the overall participant population during induction and maintenance. 
Although there were larger mean reductions in segmented neutrophils with induction and maintenance 
dosing with mirikizumab compared with placebo, there was no clinically meaningful difference between 
treatment groups in development of neutropenia, based on similar frequencies of shifts to higher 
CTCAE grades and low rates of infections reported when neutrophil counts decreased. 
 
Blood Platelets – Low 
 
Table 28 Shifts in Blood Platelets UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets 
 
 
 
Findings were consistent in the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Sets. 
The mean decrease and the lower frequency of TE-high blood platelets with mirikizumab treatment is 
consistent with decreasing UC inflammation, also reflected by decreasing platelets (as an acute phase 
reactant). 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 156/207 
 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, 1 mirikizumab-treated participant with TE-low 
blood platelets reported mild severity TEAE of platelet count decreased. The participant subsequently 
had an SAE of lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage 1 day following a study colonoscopy with biopsies. 
The TEAE of platelet count decreased was related to study drug by the investigator, and the SAE of 
lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage was related to protocol procedure by the investigator. The SAE of 
lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage resolved. In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Set, among mirikizumab-treated participants with TE-low blood platelets, no TEAEs 
associated with low blood platelets were reported. 
Given that all but 1 of the mirikizumab-treated participants with TE-low blood platelets did not report 
platelet associated TEAEs, and the fact that a decrease in blood platelets is consistent with decreasing 
UC inflammation, the higher frequency of TE-low blood platelets was not considered clinically adverse. 
 
Chemistry 
 
Only laboratory chemistry values that had a notable numerical difference between treatment groups 
are summarised in this section.  
 
Chemistry analytes related to hepatic safety 
 
Serum chemistry analytes of ALT, AST, ALP, and TB, which are related to the hepatic safety adverse 
events of special interest, are presented and discussed above. 
 
Blood Urea Nitrogen – High 
 
Findings were consistent in the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab responder Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Sets. Overall, the treatment group differences in mean change and TE-high blood 
urea nitrogen were small. In addition, no TEAEs were reported among mirikizumab-treated participants 
with TE-high blood urea nitrogen. As a result, these findings were not considered clinically adverse.

Creatine Kinase – High 
 
Table 29 Shifts in Creatine Kinase UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set Induction 
  
 
In the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, 
while a small mean increase in serum CK was seen in mirikizumab-treated participants compared with 
the placebo group, shifts to TE-high CK were mostly to CTCAE Grade 1. Additionally, most CK 
elevations were transient and returned to baseline values without interruption of study treatment. 
CK-related TEAEs associated with CTCAE grade shifts were few and were reported at a similar 
frequency in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with the placebo group. No cases of 
rhabdomyolysis or myopathy AEs were reported in either treatment group. 
Further evaluation was done to determine the number of participants with concurrent CK shifts to 
CTCAE Grade 2 or higher and elevations of AST ≥3xULN. In the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis 
Set, 32 mirikizumab-treated participants had AST ≥3xULN, 10 (31.3%) of which had concurrent 
elevation of CK to CTCAE Grade 2 or higher. In the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 
106 mirikizumab-treated participants had AST ≥3xULN, 27 (25.5%) of whom had concurrent elevation 
of CK to CTCAE Grade 2 or higher. These data support a muscle-related source of AST elevation over a 
liver-related cause for participants with concurrent CK and AST elevations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 158/207 
 
Therefore, the observed transient small increases in mean CK in the mirikizumab treatment group for 
the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets were 
not considered clinically adverse. 
 
Serum Albumin – High 
 
Table 30 Shifts in Serum Albumin UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder

Findings were consistent in the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-
Controlled Analysis Sets. 
A greater proportion of participants in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo 
reported a TE-high serum albumin. 
The higher increase in serum albumin in mirikizumab-treated participants compared with placebo 
participants was considered clinically meaningful as an indicator of response to treatment and not as 
an AE.

Differences between treatment groups in mean changes from baseline and in proportion of participants 
with TE-high sodium were small. 
In addition, no renal TEAEs were reported among mirikizumab-treated participants with TE-high 
sodium. 
As a result, these findings were not considered clinically adverse.

proportion of participants was observed in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with placebo 
who developed a TE-high total protein serum level, differences were small, and there was 1 potentially 
associated AE of dehydration reported. Therefore, these changes were not considered to be clinically 
adverse.

Systolic blood pressure 
 
In the UC Induction and the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, 
there was a small mean increase in systolic BP from baseline (less than 2 mm Hg) with mirikizumab 
compared with placebo, which was not considered clinically meaningful. 
Shifts to TE-high systolic BP were reported at a higher frequency in the mirikizumab treatment group 
compared with the placebo group. The majority of mirikizumab participants with TE-high systolic BP 
had fluctuations in BP over time with no distinct pattern, did not require antihypertensive treatment, 
and did not remain in the TE-high category at the end of the induction or maintenance treatment 
period. 
 
Diastolic blood pressure 
 
In the UC Induction and the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, 
mean change from baseline in diastolic BP was small (less than 2 mm Hg) in participants treated with 
mirikizumab and was not considered clinically meaningful. Shifts to TE-high diastolic BP were reported 
at a higher frequency in the mirikizumab treatment group compared with the placebo group. The 
majority of participants with TE-high diastolic BP had fluctuations in BP over time with no distinct 
pattern and did not require anti-hypertensive treatment. Approximately half did not remain in the TE-
high category at the end of the induction treatment period.

Hypertension-related TEAEs associated with TE-high values of systolic blood pressure or 
diastolic blood pressure or both 
 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the percentage of participants with TE-high 
systolic or diastolic BP that reported a hypertension-related TEAE was 0 in placebo, and 6.2% (n = 5) 
in mirikizumab. 
Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and no participants discontinued mirikizumab treatment 
due to a TEAE of hypertension. One mirikizumab-treated participant reported a moderate TEAE of 
hypertensive crisis in the induction treatment period. Participant with a prior medical history of 
tachyarrhythmia had a nonserious, moderate severity TEAE of hypertensive crisis, which resolved after 
2 days without concomitant medication changes. 
In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, the percentage of 
participants with TE-high systolic or diastolic BP that reported a hypertension-related TEAE was 2.4% 
(n = 1) in placebo, and 4.2% (n = 4) in mirikizumab. 
Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and no participants discontinued mirikizumab treatment 
due to a TEAE of hypertension. The majority of participants were treated with anti-hypertensive 
therapy. One mirikizumab-treated participant reported a severe TEAE of hypertension during the 
maintenance treatment period. Participant with no relevant prior medical history or concomitant 
medications, had high normal BP of 137/87 at Study AMAN (induction) baseline and 122/89 at Study 
AMBG (maintenance) baseline. The participant reported a severe TEAE of hypertension starting on Day 
200 of Study AMBG (or of the randomised maintenance period) in association with a maximal BP of 
162/113, treated with amlodipine and candesartan, resulting in normalisation of BP. 
 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
 
There were greater proportions of participants with TE-high BP in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated 
Analysis Set compared with UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set, and greater proportion in 
the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set compared with All UC Mirikizumab Integrated 
Analysis Set. The higher proportion of TEhigh BP likely reflects the higher opportunity for events of 
fluctuating BP due to the longer mean exposure to mirikizumab with increasing size and scope of the 
analysis sets. 
 
Pulse 
 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
A minimal mean decrease in pulse (less than 1 bpm) in the mirikizumab treatment group compared to 
the placebo group was observed, which was not considered a clinically meaningful difference between 
groups. 
TE-low pulse was reported in no placebo participants and 0.1% of mirikizumab participants, and TE-
high pulse was reported in 2.6% of placebo and 1.6% of mirikizumab participants with the majority of 
these reflecting fluctuations over time with normalisation towards the end of the treatment period. 
 
Heart rate-related TEAEs associated with TE-low or TE-high pulse 
 
The percentage of participants with TE-high pulse that reported an increased heart rate-related TEAE 
was 12.5% (n=1) in placebo, an 6.7% (n=1) in mirikizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 162/207 
 
One mirikizumab-treated participant with a prior medical history of tachycardia had a non-serious, mild 
severity TEAE of supraventricular tachycardia with pulse of 183 bpm on the second dosing day of 
Study AMAN. The event was treated with sodium chloride and resolved the same day. Subsequent 
pulse measurements were within normal limits despite continued study treatment dosing. 
None of the TE-low changes in pulse were associated with heart rate-related TEAEs. 
 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
A minimal mean decrease in pulse (less than 1 bpm) in the mirikizumab treatment group compared to 
the placebo group was observed, which was not considered a clinically meaningful difference between 
groups, 
TE-low pulse was reported in 1.1% of placebo participants and 0.8% of mirikizumab-treated 
participants, TE-high pulse was reported in 2.1% of placebo participants and 3.9% of mirikizumab-
treated participants with the majority of these reflecting fluctuations over time with normalisation 
towards the end of the treatment period. 
 
Heart rate-related TEAEs associated with TE-low or TE-high pulse 
None of the TE-low or high changes in pulse were associated with heart rate-related TEAEs. 
 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
The numerically higher frequency of TE-high pulse is not considered clinically meaningful and likely 
reflects the higher mean weeks of exposure in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
compared with the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set. 
 
Weight 
 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
 
Mean increases from baseline in weight were small (less than 1 kg) across treatment groups. The 
mirikizumab treatment group demonstrated a small mean increase in weight compared with the 
placebo group. 
 
Treatment-emergent adverse events 
 
None of the TE-high weight changes were considered clinically adverse, as they were not associated 
with any relevant TEAEs other than 3 TEAEs of weight increased in mirikizumab-treated participants. 
 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
Mean increases from baseline in weight were small (less than 2 kg) across treatment groups. 
The mirikizumab treatment group demonstrated a small mean increase in weight compared with the 
placebo group. 
The greater proportion of participants with TE-high weight values in the mirikizumab treatment group 
likely reflects an improvement in UC disease severity status in these participants.

2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations  
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors 
Intrinsic Factors 
The frequencies of AEs were generally comparable across age, sex, race, region, and disease severity 
subgroups within the treatment groups. These results suggest there was no clinically meaningful 
interaction between mirikizumab treatment and intrinsic factors. 
Extrinsic Factors 
A greater frequency of participants who had prior biologic or tofacitinib exposure at baseline, reported 
TEAEs compared with the subgroup that never had prior biologic or tofacitinib exposure. Differences 
are primarily due to numerically higher frequencies of the events of iron deficiency anaemia, colitis 
ulcerative, headache, pyrexia, fatigue, and arthralgia reported in mirikizumab-treated participants with 
a history of prior exposure to biologics or tofacitinib. A numerically higher frequency of these events 
are also noted for placebo participants in the ever exposed group compared with the never exposed 
group. These differences may reflect a higher disease severity, more refractory population or the 
impact of previous therapies for those participants with previous exposures, regardless of treatment 
assignment in the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. These data do not suggest a 
meaningful interaction specific to mirikizumab treatment.

Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Effects of mirikizumab on human fetal development are not known. Per Study AMAN Protocol (a) and 
Study AMBG Protocol (a), women of childbearing potential were required to test negative for 
pregnancy within 24 hours prior to mirikizumab exposure and had to either agree to remain abstinent 
or use 2 effective methods of contraception for the entirety of the study. Any pregnancy that occurred 
during study participation required permanent discontinuation. Pregnant participants and partner 
pregnancies were planned to be followed to completion, and outcomes are reported here.

Elderly 
Table 38 presents safety data by age ranges and categories as requested by CHMP. Given the small 
amount of exposure to mirikizumab represented by participants ≥65 years of age, caution in 
interpreting the frequencies of events is warranted. The intrinsic factor analyses for the placebo-
controlled induction period of Study AMAN (presented in Section 2.7.4.5.1 of the Summary of Clinical 
Safety) and maintenance period of Study AMBG (presented in Lilly’s Response to Question 164 in 
Section 5.29.1 of this document) do not demonstrate a clinically meaningful interaction between 
mirikizumab treatment and age. These results are further supported by the population PK analysis, 
where age was not found to be a clinically significant covariate.

Table 39 TEAEs that occurred in at least 3 participants ≥65 years of age and at an IR at least 
1.5 times higher than the IR in participants <65 years of age. Most (15 of the 19) SOCs with 
at least 1 TEAE that met criteria had overall higher IRs for participants ≥65 years of age 
when compared to participants <65 years of age. 
 
Many of the events with higher IRs in participants ≥65 years of age occurred at a low frequency and in 
few participants. Of the 66 PTs that occurred more frequently in participants ≥65 years, 49 occurred at 
an IR <1.0 in participants ≥65 years. 
Some of the events with higher IRs in participants ≥65 years of age are not unexpected given the 
group’s advanced age, such as cataracts (IR=0.2 in <65 and IR=1.5 in ≥65 years of age) and 
osteoarthritis (IR=0.6 in <65 and IR=1.6 in ≥65 years of age). Other events such as herpes zoster 
(IR=0.5 in <65 and IR=1.1 in ≥65 years of age) are identified as risks in both the elderly and in 
patients using immunomodulators. 
Additional events, such as dermatitis contact (IR=0.6 in <65 and IR=1.4 in ≥65 years of age) and 
abdominal pain upper (IR=0.7 in <65 and IR=1.3 in ≥65 years of age) may be related to the 
underlying UC and its extraintestinal manifestation.

Immediate Hypersensitivity Events 
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE immediate hypersensitivity event was 0.3% 
(n = 1) in placebo, and 1.0% (n = 10) in mirikizumab. 
In the placebo group and mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE immediate 
hypersensitivity event was infusion related hypersensitivity reaction. No participants reported 
anaphylaxis.  None of the reported immediate hypersensitivity events were Serious. The percentage of 
participants that discontinued study treatment due to a TE immediate hypersensitivity event was low 
(0.3%) in the mirikizumab group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023

UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE immediate hypersensitivity event was 1.0% 
(n = 2) in placebo, and 1.8% (n = 7) in mirikizumab. 
In the placebo group, the reported TE immediate hypersensitivity events were anaphylactic reaction (n 
= 1, 0.5%) and dermatitis allergic (n = 1, 0.5%). The anaphylactic reaction in the placebo participant 
was considered serious.  
In the mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE immediate hypersensitivity event 
was hypersensitivity (n = 3, 0.8%). No serious immediate hypersensitivity events were reported in 
mirikizumab-treated participants. In the placebo group, the reported reason for discontinuation due to 
a TE immediate hypersensitivity event was anaphylactic reaction (n = 1, 0.5%). 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
The IRs of TE immediate hypersensitivity events in the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, 
and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets were comparable to the Induction and 
Maintenance Analysis Sets and did not suggest an increase in immediate hypersensitivity events with 
increased duration of treatment. No serious immediate hypersensitivity events were reported in the UC 
Treatment Regimen and All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Sets. 
In the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 2 (0.1%) events of anaphylactic reaction 
were reported. These events were from the CD Phase 2 study. During the maintenance period, 2 
events of anaphylactic reaction were reported in the placebo/mirikizumab 1000 mg IV group with the 
lyophilised formulation. Both of the anaphylaxis events were reported as SAEs. 
Both participants discontinued study treatment. After these events, mitigations were implemented to 
slow the rate of IV infusion. No subsequent anaphylactic reactions occurred. In the Phase 3 UC studies, 
the shelf-stable solution formulation was used for IV infusion with no anaphylactic reactions reported. 
The number of discontinuations due to immediate hypersensitivity events in the UC Treatment 
Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets was low and did 
not suggest an increase in immediate hypersensitivity-related events with increased duration of 
treatment.

The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE non-immediate hypersensitivity event was 
2.2% (n = 7) in placebo, and 2.5% (n = 24) in mirikizumab. 
In the placebo group and mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE non-
immediate hypersensitivity event was rash 0.6% (n = 2) in placebo, and 0.5% (n = 5) in mirikizumab. 
None of the reported non-immediate hypersensitivity events were considered serious. No participants 
discontinued study treatment due to a non-immediate hypersensitivity event. 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE non-immediate hypersensitivity event was 
2.6% (n = 5) in placebo, and 6.9% (n = 27) in mirikizumab. 
In the mirikizumab treatment group, the most frequently reported TE non-immediate hypersensitivity 
event was rash (n = 13, 3.3%). The frequency of reports of rash notably increased in the mirikizumab 
treatment group during maintenance compared with induction. No rash was reported in the placebo 
group. Most events of rash were mild in severity. None resulted in study discontinuation. None of the 
reported non-immediate hypersensitivity events were considered serious. 
Based on the non-immediate hypersensitivity event SMQ (narrow terms), the percentage of 
participants that discontinued study treatment due to a TE non-immediate hypersensitivity event was 
0% (n = 0) in placebo, and 0.3% (n = 1) in mirikizumab. In the mirikizumab treatment group, the 
reported reason for discontinuation due to a TE non-immediate hypersensitivity event was injection 
site hypersensitivity (n = 1, 0.3%).

events with increased duration of treatment. 
Compared to the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set, there were 2 events in the All UC 
Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set with higher IRs, that were, eczema and rhinitis allergic. 
No events of eczema and rhinitis allergic were serious. The majority of participants reported events 
eczema and rhinitis allergic were of mild severity. 
None of the participants discontinued from study treatment due to eczema or rhinitis allergic. 
In the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set, no serious non-immediate hypersensitivity 
events were reported. In the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set, 1 serious non-immediate 
hypersensitivity event of rash was reported. In the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 
no additional serious non-immediate hypersensitivity events were reported. 
The number of discontinuations due to non-immediate hypersensitivity events in the UC Treatment

2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
Drug Interactions 
One drug-drug interaction study of mirikizumab was completed in participants with moderate-to-
severe psoriasis (Study AMBP).  
The purpose of Study AMBP was to determine whether mirikizumab affects CYP activity in participants 
with psoriasis by using a “probe cocktail” approach, whereby the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A, CYP2C9, 
CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2 substrates midazolam, warfarin, dextromethorphan, omeprazole, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 172/207 
 
caffeine, respectively, was evaluated before and after multiple mirikizumab doses were administered to 
participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. 
The results concluded that multiple SC doses of mirikizumab are unlikely to change CYP activity in 
participants with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to a degree that would be expected to contribute to 
clinically meaningful changes in the exposure of CYP3A, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2 
substrates. 
Additionally, no deaths, SAEs, or AEs resulting in discontinuation of treatment were reported in Study 
AMBP. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events  
UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The percentage of participants that discontinued study treatment due to an AE was numerically 
higher in the placebo group compared with the mirikizumab treatment group: 7.2% (n = 23) placebo 
(of these, 11 were reported as serious) and 1.6% (n = 15) mirikizumab (of these, 8 were reported as 
serious). 
Colitis ulcerative was the most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation in both the placebo 
group and mirikizumab treatment group: 5.9% (n=19) placebo, and 0.5% (n=5) mirikizumab. 
AEs that led to discontinuation more frequently in the mirikizumab-treated group compared with 
placebo were infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction 0% placebo, and 0.3% (n=3) mirikizumab, and 
lymphopenia (0% placebo, and 0.2% (n=2) mirikizumab). 
 
Infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction leading to study treatment discontinuation 
 
Of the reported infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions in mirikizumab-treated participants, none 
were serious, and all were mild or moderate in severity. Two events were reported after the second 
dose and 1 event was reported after the first dose. 
 
Lymphopenia leading to study treatment discontinuation 
 
Of the reported lymphopenia in mirikizumab-treated participants, 1 was reported as moderate and 1 
was reported severe and both had concomitant corticosteroid use. 
 
SAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation 
Serious AEs that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment in the mirikizumab treatment group 
were 
colitis ulcerative (n = 5) 
deep vein thrombosis (n = 1) reported on Day 21 
intestinal sepsis (n = 1) reported on Day 12 in a participant receiving concomitant 
prednisone and azathioprine, and 
spinal fracture (n = 1) reported on Day 81, 1 day after a fall. 
Serious AEs that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment in the placebo group were

acute myocardial infarction (n = 1) 
colitis ulcerative (n = 9), and 
sinusitis (n = 1). 
 
UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
The percentage of participants that discontinued study treatment due to an AE was 8.3% (n=16) 
placebo (of these, 9 were reported as serious);1.5% (n=6) mirikizumab (of these, 1 was reported as 
serious). 
Colitis ulcerative was the most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation in both the placebo 
group and mirikizumab treatment group. 
5.7% (n = 11) placebo, and 
0.5% (n = 2) mirikizumab. 
 
SAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation 
SAEs that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment in the mirikizumab treatment group 
Were gastric cancer (n = 1) reported in participant with family history of gastric and hepatic cancer on 
Day 166. 
SAEs that resulted in discontinuation of study treatment in the placebo group were 
anaphylactic reaction (n = 1) 
colitis ulcerative (n = 6) 
COVID-19 (n = 1), and 
presyncope (n=1). 
 
 
UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets 
 
Colitis ulcerative remained the most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation in the 
uncontrolled analysis sets. This observed finding may be due to the inclusion of participants with 
moderate or severely active UC who discontinued due to lack of efficacy. 
The types of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation, remained consistent throughout the 
uncontrolled analysis sets. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience  
Mirikizumab has not yet obtained marketing authorisation. Therefore, no post-authorisation exposure 
data are available yet. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety  
This MAA concerns a new humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mirikizumab) targeting the p19 
subunit of IL-23 used for the treatment of patients with moderately-to-severely active UC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023

The proposed recommended dose regimen for mirikizumab in this indication is intravenous 
administration of 300 mg at weeks 0, 4 and 8 followed by subcutaneous administration of 200 mg 
every 4 weeks (Q4W). 
  
Safety pools  
 
The main source of safety data provided in support of this application come from two pivotal studies 
(AMAN and AMBG) in patients with UC. AMAN (LUCENT-1) study was the placebo-controlled study 
which evaluated the safety of 300 mg of mirikizumab administrated intravenously every 4 weeks over 
a 12-week induction period. The safety data from this study are presented in the UC Induction 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set. A second placebo-controlled pivotal study (AMBG, LUCENT-2) 
investigated the maintenance treatment (from 12 to 52). During the maintenance period mirikizumab 
was given subcutaneously at the dose 200 mg every 4 weeks. The data from participants who were 
responders to mirikizumab in induction and continued their treatment in the maintenance period are 
presented in the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set.The safety 
data from these two pivotal studies were further analysed together in the UC Treatment Regimen 
Integrated Analysis Set. 
The safety comparisons in the AMBG study made by the applicant are mainly within the mirikizumab 
Induction Responders group (patients re-randomised to either placebo or to mirikizumab). The 
applicant was requested to discuss and highlight differences when the mirikizumab treated patients are 
compared to placebo responders in the AMBG study. The applicant provided the requested discussion. 
In this comparison the following PTs were reported more frequently in the mirikizumab group: 
nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, injection site pain, injection site reaction, headache, gastroesophageal 
reflux disease, injection site erythema, fatigue. In relation to events of special interest injection site 
reactions and immediate and non-immediate hypersensitivity TEAEs were reported in higher 
frequencies in the mirikizumab responders as compared to in the placebo responders. 
The data from two pivotal studies and additional uncontrolled data from Study AMBG (including AMAN 
non-responders who underwent open-label extended induction with mirikizumab and participants who 
received open label maintenance or loss of response rescue with mirikizumab) and the data from the 
AMAC and AMAP studies are included in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set. The AMAC 
study was a phase 2 dose-ranging study which evaluated IV doses of mirikizumab in a range of 50 mg 
to 600 mg Q4W. AMAP was a long-term extension study in patients with UC who are receiving open-
label mirikizumab 200 mg SC Q4W for up to 3 years. This study is currently ongoing. The applicant 
was requested to clarify the status of AMAP study (i.e a duration of exposure in this study) and 
provided the updated safety data from this study. As clarified by the applicant, in the updated safety 
database, 916 participants have been treated with mirikizumab in Study AMAP This is an increase of 
12 participants from the safety data contained in the mirikizumab UC initial submission. 
The fifth analysis set (All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set) included also patients who 
received mirikizumab for other indications such as psoriasis and CD. It is noted that the dose used for 
the treatment of UC is significantly higher as compared to doses investigated in the psoriasis 
development programme i.e 250 miri Q4W SC (induction) and 125 miri Q8W SC (maintenance) and 
therefore they are considered as supportive only in the context of this application. 
Exposure  
A total of 1442 subjects with moderately-to-severely active UC were exposed to mirikizumab across 
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 core UC studies (AMAN, AMBG, AMAC and AMAP), 725 of whom were exposed 
to iv mirikizumab for 12 weeks and 926 were exposed to mirikizumab for 1 year. 450 patients received 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 175/207 
 
their treatment with mirikizumab for a period longer than 104 weeks. 3798 patients were exploded to 
mirikizumab across all studies investigating also other indications.  
Adverse event (AE) profile 
In the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Sets, the 
percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE was similar between the mirikizumab treatment groups 
and the placebo groups. TEAEs were reported in 46.1% in the placebo group and 44.5% in the 
mirikizumab group in the UC induction period and in 68.8 % in the placebo SC Q4W and 64.5% in the 
miri 200 mg SC Q4W group in the UC placebo-controlled maintenance period.  
In the All Mirikizumab Exposures analysis set which includes patients with psoriasis and Crohn’s 
disease the exposure adjusted IR of TEAEs was significantly lower (131.1) as compared to the 
exposure adjusted IR of TEAEs in patients with ulcerative colitis (i.e. IR of 261.0 in the Mirikizumab 
300 mg IV group and IR of 160.1 the Mirikizumab 200 mg SC Q4W group).The reason for these 
differences could be related to the fact that the dose used in psoriasis studies was lower as compared 
to doses used for UC indication. The applicant was requested to discuss to what extent the safety data 
presented in the All Mirikizumab Exposures analysis set are relevant for the population of patients with 
UC. The applicant clarified that interpretation of the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
is limited by differences in exposure, background prevalence of various AEs, routes of administration, 
and dose between the different indications, making it difficult to make direct comparisons to the UC 
population. Therefore, the analyses of safety data from the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Set should be considered as supplemental to any findings from the analyses of the UC cohorts 
and, in particular, results from the randomised, placebo-controlled cohorts of participants with UC.   
For SAEs and discontinuation rates, the exposure adjusted IRs were comparable across analysis sets 
with the exception of the Mirikizumab treated patients in the UC induction period where the IR for SAEs 
and discontinuations was the highest.  
 
Common TEAEs 
 
SOCs for which TEAEs were reported by more than 10% of the participants in either treatment group 
were Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders in the UC induction period and 
Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal disorders, General disorders and administration site 
conditions, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders in the UC placebo-controlled maintenance period.  
During the UC induction in the SOC Infections and infestations nasopharyngitis (3.1% for placebo, 
4.1% for mirikizumab), URTI (0.6% for placebo, 1.4% for mirikizumab) and oral herpes (0.6 % for 
placebo and 1% for mirikizumab) were more frequently reported in the mirikizumab group. In the SOC 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders there was higher frequency of arthralgia (1.2 % versus 
2.1% for placebo and mirikizumab, respectively), in the SOC Nervous system disorders there was 
higher frequency of headache (2.8 % versus 3.3% for placebo and mirikizumab, respectively). Pyrexia 
and Fatigue were also reported more frequently in the mirikizumab group (Pyrexia:0.9% versus 1.5%, 
Fatigue: 0.6% versus 1.3%). Hypertension also occurred with slightly higher frequency in patients 
receiving mirikizumab. 
A number of PTs were reported with a higher frequency in the mirikizumab treatment group as 
compared to placebo during the UC placebo controlled maintenance period including nasopharyngitis 
(7.2%), arthralgia (6.7%), injection site pain (4,4%) headache (4.1%), abdominal pain (2.8%) fatigue 
(2.6%) hypertension, rash (3.6%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (2.6%), injection site reaction 
(2.6), injection site erythema (2.1%), pain in extremity (1.8%), cough (1.3%), influenza like illness 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 176/207 
 
(1.3%), migraine (1.3%), oropharyngeal pain, urinary tract infection (1.3%) and vulvovaginal mycotic 
infection (1.3%), however differences as compared to placebo were small (around 3 to 0.6% 
difference). 
The applicant performed additional analysis of clusters which included PTs that are essentially 
synonymous and refer to the same clinical concept. 
The frequency rash cluster (rash, rash pruritic, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, and rash popular) 
was higher both in the induction and maintenance period. All cases reported were mild or moderate in 
severity and the frequency seemed to be higher in patients receiving therapy for longer term. The 
applicant listed rash as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is supported.  
The frequency of upper respiratory tract infection cluster (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection, oropharyngeal pain, rhinitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, oropharyngeal discomfort, acute 
sinusitis, and viral URTI) was higher in the mirikizumab-treated participants. Taking into consideration 
the biologic plausibility for an association between mirikizumab and the occurrence of URTI 
(immunomodulatory mode of action of mirikizumab), the applicant listed URTI in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, which is acceptable.  
The frequency of Headache and Headache cluster was higher in patients receiving mirikizumab. All 
headache events were reported as mild or moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study 
treatment discontinuation. Headache is listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Herpes zoster was the most frequently reported opportunistic infection in the All UC Mirikizumab and 
the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets, the majority of which were mild to moderate in 
severity, with 1 participant reporting a severe event. There was a small imbalance in the frequency of 
opportunistic infections. In the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis 
Set, the frequency of opportunistic infections increased in the mirikizumab treatment group driven by 
cases of herpes zoster. Based on the immunomodulatory mode of action of mirikizumab, there is 
biologic plausibility for an association between the administration of mirikizumab and the occurrence of 
herpes zoster. 
Arthralgia - higher frequency was observed in the induction period (1.2 % versus 2.1% for placebo and 
mirikizumab, respectively) and the maintenance period (3% versus 6.7% for placebo and mirikizumab, 
respectively).  Further arthralgia is listed as ADR in the SmPC of other IL-23 inhibitors i.e. ustekinumab 
and guselkumab. 
Arthralgia and herpes zoster infection were added to the list of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Fatigue - higher frequency was observed in the induction period (0.6% versus 1.3% for placebo and 
mirikizumab, respectively) and the maintenance period (0.7% versus 2.6 % for placebo and 
mirikizumab, respectively). In addition, for fatigue cluster the higher frequency as compared to 
placebo was observed in the maintenance period. Based on further clarification provided it was agreed 
with the applicant that the small imbalance in the frequency of reported fatigue mostly seen in the 
induction period no updates to the SmPC is necessary, especially taking into consideration that all 
events of fatigue were mild or moderate, and none were serious in either treatment group. 
In All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set the majority of common TEAEs were reported at a lower 
IR compared with the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set with exception of colitis 
ulcerative, COVID-19, and upper respiratory tract infection. On the other hand, for some common 
TEAEs such as Headache, Arthralgia, Anaemia, Upper respiratory tract infection, Pyrexia, Hypertension, 
Nausea, Back pain, Fatigue, Abdominal pain and Injection site pain the IR was higher in the UC 
Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set as compared to the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis 
Set. The applicant was requested to comment on how to interpret these results. The applicant provided 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 177/207 
 
an explanation regarding the higher IR of some AEs seen in the the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated 
Analysis Set as compared to the UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set. This clarification can be 
accepted. 
As indicated by the applicant also in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets (which 
included patients treated for other indications), the majority of common TEAEs were reported at a 
lower IR compared with the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set. The applicant provided 
discussion in relation to TEAEs for which IR was higher in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Sets as compared to the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set. It was highlighted 
by the applicant that the numerical differences in IR were small, and the events were non-serious, 
expected in the general population, or reported at a low frequency overall. 
 
Related TEAEs 
 
During the induction period 35 patients (10.9%) in the placebo group and 99 patients (10.3%) in the 
treatment group reported related TEAEs. The most frequently related TEAEs were within SOC of Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders followed by SOC of Infections and infestations. Pruritus, 
nasopharyngitis (6 patients), headache (13 patients), nausea (5 patients), leukopenia (5 patients) and   
arthralgia (5 patients) were most frequent PTs reported to be related the study treatment.  For 
nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea and leukopenia the frequency was higher in the mirikizumab group 
as compared to the placebo group.  
During the maintenance period, related TEAEs were reported in 32 patients (16.7%) in placebo group 
and in 65 patients (16.7%). Related TEAEs within the SOC of general disorders and administration site 
conditions were most frequently reported and included different types of injection site reactions. 
Related Infections and infestations were reported in 2 (1%) and 12 (3.1%) patients in the UC 
maintenance period in patients on placebo and Mirikizumab respectively.  In relation to the types of 
infection reported they were viral infections (including Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster), fungal 
infections and URTI. The SmPC informs in 4.4 that opportunistic infections were reported in clinical 
trials. 
In the UC Treatment Regimen, UC Miri Exposures and All Miri Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets 
related TEAEs were reported in 21.9, 23.0 and 26.8 % of patients respectively. Again, TEAEs within the 
SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions were most frequently reported followed by 
the Infections and infestations. 
 
Severe TEAEs 
 
The majority of reported TEAEs were mild or moderate. Severe TEAEs were reported in less than 9.5% 
in any treatment group. 
During the UC induction period Severe TEAEs were reported in 23 (7.2%) of patients in the placebo 
group and 21 (2.2%) in the treatment group. During the induction period 5 cases of severe infections 
were reported such as pneumonia, cytomegalovirus colitis, intestinal sepsis, Dengue fever and 
Klebsiella infection. It can be agreed that there was no pattern in the type of severe TEAEs, as each PT 
was reported by 1 participant (with exception of anaemia reported by 2 patients).  It is noted that one 
severe case of Fatigue was reported in this period.  
During the maintenance period, severe TEAEs were reported in less than 9 % of patients in any 
treatment group. In patients receiving mirikizumab severe TEAEs were reported in 16 (4.1%) of 
patients. 3 severe infections were reported in the mirikizumab treated patients such as 
Nasopharyngitis, Herpes zoster, COVID-19 pneumonia. In the placebo-controlled maintenance period, 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 178/207 
 
no pattern in the type of severe TEAEs can be identified. It is noted that one case of severe injection 
site pain and one case of hypertension was reported.  
In the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis 
Sets severe TEAEs were reported by 21 (5.4%), 104 (7.2%) and 331 (8.7%) patients, respectively. 
The applicant was requested to discuss and clarify if there was any pattern in the type of severe TEAEs 
reported in these sets. The applicant provided the requested discussion. When considering differences 
in population characteristics, sample size, exposure, and occurrence of single or infrequent severe 
events across the analysis sets, no clear pattern of severe TEAEs was observed by SOC or PT. In most 
cases, the frequencies and IRs of severe TEAEs were similar among the 3 analysis sets. Of the most 
frequently reported severe TEAEs, the PT of COVID-19 pneumonia. 
 
Safety of extended induction dose  
 
The extended induction cohort of Study AMBG was a non-randomised group of participants who did not 
achieve clinical response at the end of the 12-week induction and continued to receive the induction 
dose in the open-label extended induction period. There was 313 mirikizumab non-responders and 148 
placebo non-responders. From the 313 mirikizumab-treated non-responders who entered Study AMBG, 
277 (88.5%) completed 3 cycles of extended induction treatment for a total of 6 doses of mirikizumab 
300 mg IV Q4W.  
In the open-label extended induction period, the frequency of TEAEs reported for the placebo induction 
non-responders group was 29.1% (n=43) and for the mirikizumab induction non-responders group 
was 38.3% (n=120). Severe TEAEs were reported in 3.2% of patients in the mirikizumab induction 
non-responders group. SAE were reported in 5.4 % of mirikizumab induction non-responders.  
 
Study AMBG Extended Induction compared with UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set 
 
For the analysis of safety of the extended induction dose, the data from mirikizumab-treated non-
responders participating in the extended induction arm of Study AMBG (and therefore receiving  up to 
6 dose of 300 mg IV Q4W)  were compared to the data from the mirikizumab-treated  patients in the 
induction period (and therefore only receiving upto 3 doses of 300 mg IV Q4W). 
This comparison showed that an additional 12 weeks of mirikizumab extended induction treatment was 
not associated with a meaningful increase in reporting of AEs in most SOCs. Only for three SOC (i.e 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, Endocrine disorders and Neoplasms benign, 
malignant, and unspecified) the frequency of TEAEs was higher in the extended induction arm. For the 
SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders this difference was mostly driven by PT arthralgia 
(listed in section 4.8). For the Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified SOC there was a small 
difference in the frequency of malignancies reported (i.e 2 for the standard induction dose and 4 for 
the extended induction dose). However, taking into consideration types of malignancies reported 
(adenocarcinoma, rectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma), increased risk for malignancies in these 
patients and relatively short exposure to the treatment, it is unlikely that there is an increased risk of 
malignancies with the extended induction dose. For the SOC Endocrine disorders a number of events 
was small, i.e. 3 cases. 
It is noted that one case of Hy’s Law was identified in the patient enrolled to the extended induction 
period (please see discussion below). Except the 1 participant meeting Hy’s law criteria described 
below, no other mirikizumab-treated participants discontinued mirikizumab during the Extended 
Induction 
period due to a hepatic TEAE. 
Assessment report

Adverse events of special interest 
 
Hepatic safety  
 
Elevations in hepatic laboratory test in patients treated with mirikizumab were reported infrequently. 
Frequencies of liver enzymes ≥5x and ≥10x ULN were low. 
In the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set the number of patients reporting at least one 
hepatic TEAE was small and similar between the treatment groups (1.6% in each treatment group).   
In the UC placebo-controlled maintenance period again the frequency of patients reporting at least one 
hepatic TEAE were similar between the treatment groups (placebo responder, placebo SC-3.0%; 
mirikizumab responders, placebo SC-2.1% and mirikizumab responders 3.1%of patients).  
In the All UC Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, frequencies of TE elevations in ALT and 
AST ≥3xULN in mirikizumab-treated participants were low however higher (ALT = 2.0%, AST = 2.1%) 
than in participants in the UC Placebo Group (ALT = 1.1%, AST = 0.5%). 
No hepatic SAEs were reported in the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder 
Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set.  
One patient experienced a serious adverse event of cholecystitis acute of moderate severity in the 
extension study i.e after 466 days after starting treatment with 300 miri Q4W IV (induction) and 76 
days since the last dose of 200 miri Q4W SC. 
In the UC development programme three patients discontinued their treatment with Mirikizumab due 
to hepatic adverse events. Two cases - one case of autoimmune hepatitis and one case of potential 
drug-induced liver injury without alternative aetiology or significant confounding risk factors - were the 
most concerning.  
 
Autoimmune hepatitis 
 
One mirikizumab-treated participant in the UC maintenance treatment period discontinued the study 
treatment due to a TEAE of autoimmune hepatitis which occurred 211 days after starting treatment 
with mirikizumab 300 mg Q4W IV in AMAN study. No relevant medical history was reported for this 
patient.   
Cases of autoimmune hepatitis have been reported in patients receiving treatment with other biological 
therapies and the potential role of mirikizumab cannot be excluded. The investigator considered the AE 
of autoimmune hepatitis as not related to study drug, but the applicant considered this case as 
possibly related although it is more likely that it was a pre-existing AIH. Cases autoimmune hepatitis 
will be monitored post-marketing and if any cases reported will be presented in the PSUR.  
 
Drug-induced liver injury 
 
In total, 4 patients in the UC development programme fulfilled the criteria for DILI i.e. TB ≥2xULN and 
ALT or AST ≥3xULN (2 patients) and ALT or AST ≥10xULN (2 patients). For one case the applicant as 
well as 3 independent experts assessed the relationship to Mirikizumab as probable. For the remaining 
3 cases this relationship was considered as unlikely.  
For the patient, who discontinued the study treatment AST, ALT and serum total bilirubin elevations 
met the category of potential drug-induced liver injury (meeting Hy’s Law criteria). This patient 
completed the AMAN study and entered into AMBG study as a mirikizumab non-responder and 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 180/207 
 
continued receiving the higher iv dose of mirikizumab i.e 300 mg Q4W IV. In total, this patient 
received 5 doses of mirikizumab 300 mg Q4W IV (two last doses in the OL extended induction period). 
No medical history or pre-existing conditions were reported for this patient and concomitant 
medications included prednisone only. The patient never consumed alcohol and never used tobacco. At 
screening the patient’s hepatic enzymes were within normal limits. This patient first reported pruritus 
(noted as hepatic pruritus by the investigator) which was followed by changes in liver enzymes. ALT 
and AST peaked with ALT at 609 U/L (17.9x ULN), AST at 336 U/L (9.9x ULN). A total bilirubin reached 
51 μmol/L (2.4x ULN) and ALP reached 187 U/L (1.8x ULN). 
The investigator considered the AE of hepatic enzyme increased as related to study drug as no 
alternative aetiology or significant confounding risk factors were identified in this patient. The applicant 
considered this case as an idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury. 
In this patient liver enzymes normalised after the discontinuation of therapy (i.e. 56 days after the first 
elevation) without therapeutic intervention or hospitalisation. 
In the psoriasis development programme further cases which fulfilled the criteria for DILI were 
reported.  
An external committee, comprised of 3 independent external physicians trained in hepatology and with 
expertise in DILI, reviewed 6 cases with maximum ALT or AST ≥3xULN and TB ≥2xULN, 10 cases with 
ALT and/or AST ≥10xULN, and 8 cases of treatment discontinuations due to hepatic TEAEs. For three 
cases relationship to the study treatment was considered as probable or possible related.  
This safety concern was extensively discussed with the applicant. It was noted that based on review of 
cases with a probable or possible association with mirikizumab treatment, elevations in hepatic 
enzymes improved or normalised with or without discontinuation of mirikizumab treatment, and none 
resulted in death, a serious outcome, or other sequelae. Further frequencies of elevations of ALT and 
AST reported in studies with mirikizumab were not higher as seen in studies for the products of the 
same class.  
Based on the totality of the data the benefit/risk balance was considered as positive with the following 
risk mitigation measures: 
A warning in section 4.4 was introduced with a recommendation for monthly liver monitoring during an 
induction followed by less frequently monitoring during the maintenance therapy. Further, if increases 
in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are observed and drug-
associated liver injury is suspected, mirikizumab must be discontinued until this diagnosis is excluded.  
Identification of elevations in ALT and AST as ADRs in Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
Severe liver injury was added as an impotent potential risk in the RMP and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities were introduced, including use of spontaneous hepatic disorders follow-up 
form and inclusion of severe liver injury as an outcome of interest in the observational secondary 
database study to assess the long-term safety of mirikizumab. 
 
Infections  
 
Mirikizumab is an immunomodulatory drug and as such, may increase the risk of developing an 
infection or may exacerbate an existing infection. In geranial, the frequency of infections was higher in 
the mirikizumab treated patients as compared to those on placebo although the deference between the 
groups was small. During the induction period the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 
TE infection was 14.0% (n = 45) in placebo, and 15.1% (n = 145) in the mirikizumab group. The most 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 181/207 
 
frequently reported TE infection was nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, oral herpes, 
rhinitis for which the frequency was higher in the mirikizumab group. Upper respiratory tract infections 
are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The remaining types of infections no association with the 
mirikizumab treatment was determined. 
During the placebo-controlled maintenance period the percentage of participants that reported at least 
1 TE infection was 22.9% (n = 44) in placebo, and 23.9% (n = 93) in the mirikizumab group. Again 
nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported followed by Covid 19 and upper respiratory tract 
infection.  
Due to its mechanism of action mirikizumab may increase the risk of severe infection and the SmPC 
includes a contraindication in case of active tuberculosis and a warning that mirikizumab may increase 
the risk of severe infection and provides guidance in case of clinically important acute, chronic, or 
serious infection. In addition, serious infections are listed as an important potential risk for 
mirikizumab, and these events will be monitored in the post-authorisation setting via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and as part of the objective of the additional post-authorisation 
pharmacovigilance study entitled “Observational Secondary Database Study to Assess the Long-Term 
Safety of Mirikizumab” that is a category 3 study in the RMP. 
Opportunistic infections 
The frequency of reported TE opportunistic infections was low however, they occurred more frequently 
in the mirikizumab treated patients. As discussed, the increased frequency of opportunistic infections in 
the mirikizumab treatment group was driven by cases of herpes zoster. Section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
updated in this regard. The remaining PTs were mostly represented by single events. During the 
induction period 1 oesophageal candidiasis, 2 cytomegalovirus colitis, 1 HZ, 1 intestinal tuberculosis 
were reported. During the placebo-controlled maintenance period, oral candidiasis and 4 HZ infections 
were reported. In the All UC Mirikizumab analysis set opportunistic infections were reported in 25 
(1.7%) patients whereas in all Miri Exposures Integrated Analysis Set in 71 (1.9%) patients. Infections 
including opportunistic infections will be monitored in the post-authorisation setting via routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and as part of the objective of the additional post-authorisation 
pharmacovigilance study (as discussed above). 
Serious infections 
Serious infections were reported infrequently i.e less than 2.3% in any treatment group. Pneumonia 
was the most frequently reported.  It is noted that serious infections are included in the RMP as 
Important potential risks, which is acceptable.  Opportunistic infections and serious infections will be 
monitored in the planned by the applicant the observational secondary database study, which is 
supported. 
Infusion and injection site reactions 
Infusion site reactions 
Infusion site reactions were reported in 8 patients (0.6%) receiving mirikizumab iv. Infusion site 
erythema, infusion site pain, infusion site paraesthesia, infusion site pruritus, Infusion site swelling, 
infusion site bruising, infusion site bruising, infusion site extravasation, infusion site hypoaesthesia, 
infusion site urticarial were reported. None of Infusion site reactions were serious. No participants 
discontinued due to an infusion site reaction. Infusion-related hypersensitivity infusion site reactions 
are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
Injection site reactions (SC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 182/207 
 
Injection site reactions were reported in 8.7% of UC patients. Inactions site pain was the most 
frequently reported.  No serious Injection site reactions were reported. One patient discontinued due to 
a TE Injection site reaction. Injection site reaction cluster are listed in the SmPC which is acceptable. 
The frequency of participants with 1 or more Injection site reactions (HLT) was similar between TE ADA 
negative (8.3%) and TE ADA positive participants (10.2%). 
Malignancy 
Malignancies were reported in 16 (1.1%) of patients exposed to mirikizumab in the UC development 
programme. Adenocarcinoma of colon and rectal cancer was the most frequently reported (3 patient 
each). None were considered related to mirikizumab by the investigators. In evaluating the frequency 
of malignancies by 12-week intervals, there was no increase in the frequency of malignancy events in 
the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set with increasing duration of mirikizumab exposure 
There is no clear evidence of an increased risk for developing malignancies following treatment with 
mirikizumab based on results of the clinical trials presented so far in this application. As there is an 
established increased risk for cancer development in UC and there is a theoretical possibility of 
decreased immune surveillance against malignancies with alteration of immune pathways with 
mirikizumab treatment, malignancy was added Important Potential Risk in the RMP. In addition, rare 
events and events with longer latency, which includes malignancies will be investigated in the planned 
post-authorisation safety study entitled “Observational Secondary Database Study to Assess the Long-
Term Safety of Mirikizumab.” 
Cerebrocardiovascular Events 
In total, 28 cases of Adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were reported in 
mirikizumab-treated participants in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set which 
included not only patients with UC but also those treated for other indications such as psoriasis and 
CD.  
Only 6 MACEs were from patients with moderately to severely active UC and all of them were reported 
in the extended maintenance or long-term extension periods of studies. 
The remaining 22 cases were from the psoriasis development programme and again most of them (17 
out of 22) were reported in the maintenance or long-term extension studies.  
In the placebo-controlled period of the mirikizumab psoriasis development programme, a numerical 
imbalance for MACE (placebo = 0; mirikizumab = 5; 0.4% [1.2 IR]) was observed. However, this 
numerical imbalance in participants with psoriasis needs to be interpreted in the context of o 
randomisation differences between placebo- and mirikizumab-treated participants (6:1) and 
subsequently a significant imbalance in the number  of patients enrolled to each arm. 
The IRs for MACE observed in the All UC Mirikizumab Integrated Analysis Set (IR=0.2) and the All 
Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set (IR=0.3 IR) were not higher as compared to the 
background rate for MACE as reported in the literature.  
The majority of cases (22 out of 28) of MACEs were not considered related to the study treatment by 
investigators. In 6 patients MACEs were assessed by investigators as possibly related to mirikizumab 
however, all these patients had risk factors for such evens. 
In conclusion, a causal relationship of MACE with mirikizumab treatment was not determined based on 
the data presented so far.  
Nevertheless, taking into consideration small imbalances of MACEs in psoriasis studies these cases will 
be monitored post-marketing including in the observational secondary database study planned by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 183/207 
 
applicant. Further, in line with other IL23 inhibitors major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was 
included as an important potential risk to the RMP. 
17 patients in the psoriasis studies reported 19 AEs of cardiac arrhythmias (including 5 severe events). 
The IR of TE serious arrhythmia events in the All UC Mirikizumab (IR=0.2) and All Mirikizumab 
Exposures Integrated Analysis Sets (IR=0.3) was not higher than seen in general population. 
Of the 22 UC and psoriasis participants in the mirikizumab development programme who reported 
serious arrhythmias, all had risk factors including age older than 50 years, increased BMI, and 
preexisting and/or medical history of CV disease. 
Depression and Suicide 
Both in the UC induction and placebo-controlled maintenance period a lower percentage of participants 
in the mirikizumab treatment group reported any worsening of depression or worsening from No or 
Mild depression to Moderate, Severe, or Very Severe compared with the placebo group. The 
percentage of participants that reported at least 1 depression event similar between the treatment 
groups. Depression was reported in 0.6% (n = 2) in placebo, and 0.4% (n = 4) in mirikizumab during 
the induction period and in 0% in placebo, and 1.0% (n = 4) in mirikizumab during the maintenance 
placebo-controlled period. 2 patients (one with UC and one with psoriasis) reported TE suicide and self-
injury event. Both cases were considered as not related to mirikizumab and both patients had history 
of depression.  
Hypersensitivity  
Immediate hypersensitivity events were reported in UC development programme including Infusion 
related reaction (6 patients), infusion related hypersensitivity reaction (4 patients), Hypersensitivity (4 
patients) and rash (3 patients). No anaphylactic reactions were reported in the mirikizumab treated 
patients.  
All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 2 (0.1%) events of anaphylactic reaction were 
reported in the CD Phase 2 study. During the maintenance period, 2 events of anaphylactic reaction 
were reported in the placebo/mirikizumab 1000 mg IV group with the lyophilised formulation. After 
these events, mitigations were implemented to slow the rate of IV infusion. No subsequent 
anaphylactic reactions occurred. In the Phase 3 UC studies, the shelf-stable solution formulation was 
used for IV infusion with no anaphylactic reactions reported. In the proposed SmPC, it is stated that 
300mg should be administered over at least 30 minutes.  
Immunogenicity 
With 12 months of treatment, up to 23 % of mirikizumab-treated patients developed anti-drug 
antibodies, most of which were of low titre and tested positive for neutralising activity. Using all narrow 
and broad search terms in the UC Treatment Regimen Integrated Analysis Set, the frequency of 
hypersensitivity reactions was similar between TE ADA negative and TE ADA positive patients (15.2% 
and 15.9%, respectively). The frequency of patients with at least 1 infusion site reaction was similar 
between TE ADA negative and TE ADA positive patients (0.3% and 0%, respectively). The frequency of 
patients with at least 1 injection site reaction high-level term (HLT) TEAE was slightly higher in the TE 
ADA positive patients (8.3% for TE ADA negative patients and 10.2% for ADA positive patients 
respectively).  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
In the mirikizumab development programme, 17 deaths were reported including 3 reported after 
database lock. Out of the 17 deaths reported, 4 were reported off-treatment. Five deaths were 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 184/207 
 
reported in the mirikizumab UC clinical programme, 11 deaths were reported in the psoriasis clinical 
programme, and 1 death was reported in the CD clinical programme.  
It is noted that 7 out of 14 deaths were associated with Covid -19 infection (3 in the UC development 
programme and 4 in the psoriasis development programme). Patients who died due to Covid -19 
infections had many comorbidities such as hypertension, morbid obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus 
however they were relatively young with mean age of this group 57 years of age. Investigators 
considered that these Covid -19 related deaths were unrelated to the study treatment or protocol 
procedures. 
The treatment with Mirikizumab could promote development of serious infections and serious infections 
are listed in the RMP as important potential risks, therefore some role of mirikizumab in this context 
cannot be excluded.  In the SmPC is included the following statement: “Mirikizumab may increase the 
risk of infection. Treatment with mirikizumab should not be initiated in patients with a clinically 
important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated”. The applicant was 
requested to discuss imbalances in deaths reported in patients with Covid-19 infections and the 
potential contributing role of mirikizumab. The applicant provided the requested discussion. It is noted 
that patients who died due to Covid-19 infections had risk factors for death.  
Two deaths in the UC development programme were not Covid–19 related.   
Death in one AMAN patient seems to be secondary to acute severe ulcerative colitis in a patient who 
had been unresponsive to a number of medical interventions in the past.  This patient required 
subtotal colectomy but unfortunately was already a high-risk candidate for this due to her medical 
comorbidities. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic candida and cytomegalovirus colitis 
reported in this patient were not considered related to the study treatment by the investigated. The 
second non-Covid-19 death occurred 117 days after receiving his last dose of 300 mg mirikizumab IV, 
following a proctocolectomy and ileostomy for UC and adenocarcinoma of the rectum. 
There were two cardiovascular deaths in the psoriasis development programme, one due to intracranial 
haemorrhage (37 days since the last dose of 125 miri Q8W SC) and one due to acute myocardial 
infarction (98 days since the last dose of 250 miri Q4W SC). Both patients had a history of 
hypertension.  In addition, one patient aged 40 experienced sudden death (59 days since the last dose 
of 125 miri Q8W SC). Finally, three deaths in the psoriasis development programme were malignancy 
related.  
Serious adverse events 
In the UC Induction and UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled Analysis Set, a 
numerically higher percentage of participants in the placebo group reported at least 1 SAE compared to 
the mirikizumab treatment group.  
During the induction period the percentage of participants with at least 1 SAE reported was 5.3% (n = 
17) in the placebo group and in the 2.8% (n = 27) mirikizumab group. In both the placebo group and 
mirikizumab treatment groups, the most frequently reported SAE was colitis ulcerative. It can be 
agreed that there was no pattern in the type of SAEs reported, as each PT was reported by 1 
participant only (with exception of colitis ulcerative reported in 8 patients and 2 patients with 
pneumonia).   
During the placebo-controlled maintenance period the percentage of participants with at least 1 SAE 
reported was 7.8% (n = 15) in the placebo group and 3.3% (n = 13) in the mirikizumab group. Again, 
there was no pattern in the type of SAEs, as each PT was reported by 1 participant only. 
In the UC Treatment Regimen, All UC Mirikizumab, and All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis 
Sets SAEs were reported by 18 (4.6%), 123 (8.5%) and 385 (10.1%) patients respectively.  Colitis 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 185/207 
 
ulcerative, COVID-19 pneumonia, Pneumonia, Acute myocardial infarction and appendicitis were most 
frequently reported.  
Laboratory findings 
 
Haematology 
 
Higher frequencies for TE-decreased monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets in the mirikizumab 
treatment group as compared to the placebo group were observed the UC Induction Placebo-Controlled 
Analysis Set however, the number of affected patients was low in any treatment group (0.3% versus 
1.5% for monocytes, 4.9% versus 8.5% for neutrophils and 0.6% versus 1.6% for platelets). 
For monocytes and neutrophils in the UC Maintenance Mirikizumab Responder Placebo-Controlled 
Analysis Set the frequency of patients with low values was not higher in the mirikizumab treatment 
group 
whereas for platelets again TE-low values were more frequently reported in the mirikizumab treated 
patients. 
The analyses based on the change from baseline showed a greater decrease in blood monocyte 
neutrophils, and platelets in mirikizumab treated participants than in the placebo group but the mean 
decrease in cell counts from baseline were small and not considered to be of clinical significance. 
Some patients were taking concomitant therapies (including corticosteroid, azathioprine and 
sulfasalazine) which could affect cell counts in these patients.  
There is no clear biologic plausibility for an association between decreased monocytes or decreased 
platelets and mirikizumab treatment. Therefore, taking also into consideration a small number of cases 
reported, no update to the SmPC was required.  
Although there is biologic plausibility for low neutrophils in participants treated with mirikizumab, also 
for neutrophils update to the product information was not considered necessary. 
This was based on the fact that the number of cases was small and there was lack of consistent 
findings in the induction and maintenance periods (during maintenance no differences between the 
treatment group were seen). Further there was no difference in the frequencies and types of infection-
related TEAEs in participants with shifts to a higher CTCAE grade between the placebo and mirikizumab 
treatment groups. 
The applicant agreed to monitor changes in monocytes, as well as neutrophils and platelets, in the 
ongoing clinical trials and through routine postmarketing pharmacovigilance activities. Further, cases 
of decreased neutrophils should be presented in the PSUR as a topic of special interest.  
Chemistry 
Cases of elevated liver enzymes were reported in subject participating in the studies with mirikizumab 
and these elevations occurred more frequently in the mirikizumab treated subjects as compared to 
those on placebo. In addition, cases of potential hepatocellular and cholestatic DILI were reported (for 
further discussion in relation to hepatic safety please see above). 
In relation to other laboratory chemistry parameters numerical differences between treatment groups 
were noted for blood urea nitrogen, creatinine kinase, serum albumin sodium, and total serum protein 
although these changes were considered of lower clinical significance.  
The increase in serum CK was seen in mirikizumab-treated participants compared with the placebo 
group.  The majority of patients had Grade 1 increase however Grade 4 increases were also reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 186/207 
 
(in 11 mirikizumab-treated patients and only one patient on placebo). 30 % of patients with an 
increase in serum CK had also concurrent elevation of AST. No cases of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy 
were reported.  
In relation to the reported changes in serum CK discussion was requested and few mirikizumab-treated 
participants reported TEAEs of increased CK in association with a shift to a higher CTCAE grade 
(0.4%), and those that were reported were not serious. TEAEs that may be associated with a shift to a 
higher CTCAE grade for CK were reported at a higher frequency in the placebo group (0.6%) than in 
the mirikizumab treatment group (0.5%). Additionally, most elevations were transient and returned to 
baseline at next assessment while continuing mirikizumab treatment, were associated with other 
medications, physical activity, or AEs that could result in an increased risk for serum CK elevations, 
and time-to-onset was variable. High serum CK does not demonstrate any unique time course or any 
new or unique risk factors that could be identified. There were no CK elevations associated with 
infusion reactions, and no temporal relationship with injection site reactions was identified. Based on 
the justification provided by the applicant CHMP agreed that no SmPC update is required.  
Vital signs  
A higher frequency of TE-high systolic and diastolic BP was observed among mirikizumab-treated 
participants compared to those who received placebo: however, most of these events were non-
serious, had no clinical sequelae, did not lead to study discontinuation, and were assessed as not 
related to mirikizumab by the study investigators.  
In relation to the mean and median systolic and diastolic BP, these were higher in the mirikizumab-
treated participants compared to those who received placebo: however, the difference between the 
groups was small, i.e. less than 2 mmHg which is considered as clinically insignificant difference.  
Therefore, no update to the SmPC was considered necessary.  
Safety in subpopulations  
The applicant analysed the safety of mirikizumab depending on the intrinsic (age, sex, race, region, 
and disease severity) and extrinsic factors (prior biologic or tofacitinib exposure at baseline).  
Some differences were noted. TEAEs were reported more frequently in Female patients (26.2%) as 
compared to male patients (16.2%). In addition, Infections and infestations were more frequently 
reported in female participants.  
No differences in the frequency TEAEs were reported in age groups. TEAEs were reported 20.1% of 
patients aged 65 or less as compared to 19.5% of patients >65 years of age.  
Use in pregnancy  
There were no adverse effects on the embryos, foetuses, and off springs demonstrated in non-clinical 
studies using pregnant monkeys. Pregnant or lactating women were excluded from the development 
programme. There were 28 pregnancies from maternal exposure and 41 pregnancies from paternal 
exposure reported. No cases of mirikizumab use during breast-feeding were reported Therefore, the 
available data are insufficient to conclude on the safety of mirikizumab use in pregnancy or lactation 
and the SmPC wording is reflecting this. Safety of mirikizumab in pregnant women and lactating 
women is included as missing information in the RMP which is supported. It needs to be noted that 
Women of childbearing potential are expected to comprise a significant proportion of the target UC 
population. 
Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 187/207 
 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of mirikizumab were not conducted which was considered acceptable my the 
CHMP. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
Adequate risk mitigation has been implemented on the main safety concerns. Long term safety in 
particular on MACE and DILI will be further characterised post authorisation by means of an 
observational secondary database study as described in the RMP (category 3).

Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical measures to 
address the risk: 
SmPC Section 4.4 advises: 
• 
Elevations of aminotransferases have been reported in patients receiving 
mirikizumab. Evaluate liver enzymes as clinically indicated. If increases in 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 
observed and drug-associated liver injury is suspected, discontinue 
mirikizumab until this diagnosis is excluded. 
SmPC Section 4.8 indicates: 
• 
Over all mirikizumab treatment periods in the ulcerative colitis clinical 
development programme (including the placebo controlled and open-label 
induction and maintenance periods), there have been elevations of ALT to 
3x upper limit of normal (ULN) (2.0%), 5xULN (0.7%) and 10xULN 
(0.2%) and AST to 3xULN (2.1%), 5xULN (1.1%), and 10xULN 
(0.1%) in patients receiving mirikizumab (see Section 4.4). These 
elevations have been noted with and without concomitant elevations in 
total bilirubin. 
PL Section 2 advises 
• 
Your doctor may check blood tests to help tell if your liver is functioning 
normally. If blood tests are abnormal, your doctor might interrupt therapy 
with mirikizumab and do additional tests on your liver to determine the 
cause.

SmPC Section 4.6 provides guidance:  
• 
Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of 
contraception during treatment and for at least 10 weeks after treatment. 
• 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of mirikizumab in pregnant 
women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects 
with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of mirikizumab during pregnancy. 
• 
It is unknown whether mirikizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs 
are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after 
birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon afterwards; 
consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this 
short period. Afterwards, mirikizumab could be used during breast-feeding 
if clinically needed. 
PL Section 2 advises:  
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a 
baby, ask your doctor for advice before using this medicine. It is preferable 
to avoid the use of mirikizumab in pregnancy. The effects of mirikizumab in 
pregnant women are not known. If you are a woman of childbearing 
potential, you are advised to avoid becoming pregnant and should use 
adequate contraception while using mirikizumab and for at least 10 weeks 
after the last mirikizumab dose.  
• 
If you are breast feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor 
before using this medicine.

2.7.4.  Conclusion  
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system  
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information  
2.9.1.  User consultation  
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: considering that Omvoh 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is to be diluted and 
administered by a qualified healthcare professional, and taken into account the proven space 
constraints, the QRD Group agreed to apply the minimum particulars to the 15-mL vial. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 193/207 
 
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Omvoh (mirikizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition  
UC is a chronic disease of unknown aetiology that is characterised by inflammation of the colon and 
rectum. Symptoms include diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and bowel movement urgency. 
UC has a relapsing-remitting course, meaning that many patients have intermittent disease flares that 
are interspersed with periods of remission. It has a reported prevalence of 2.4 to 505 per 100,000 
persons in Europe. 
The most severe intestinal manifestations of UC which are life threatening and can be fatal are toxic 
megacolon and perforation.  Extraintestinal complications include arthritis (peripheral or axial 
involvement), dermatological conditions (erythema nodosum, aphthous stomatitis, and pyoderma 
gangrenosum), inflammation of the eye (uveitis), and liver dysfunction (primary sclerosing cholangitis) 
Treatment goals in UC include induction of remission (typically within a 6 to 12-week time frame) and 
maintenance of remission in the longer term (assessed over 52 weeks of continuous treatment in 
clinical trials). In both clinical practice and in clinical trials, clinical response and clinical remission are 
assessed by a combination of endoscopy (improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa 
and healing of ulcers) and patient-reported outcomes, including a reduction in stool frequency (SF) and 
a resolution of RB (Levesque et al. 2015). Control of intestinal inflammation in UC is also associated 
with a reduction in the risk of hospitalisation, colectomy, and in the longer term, UC associated 
dysplasia and colorectal cancer. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: for the treatment of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic treatment or a Janus kinase 
(JAK) inhibitor, or have medical contraindications to such therapies (see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Medications used for the treatment of UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA)–containing medications 
(sulfasalazine, mesalazine, balsalazide, olsalazine), corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as AZA 
and 6-MP, and biologic medications. A significant proportion of patients with moderately to severely 
active UC may have an inadequate response to medicines such as 5-ASAs or corticosteroids, be unable 
to maintain a clinical response to 5-ASAs or AZA or are unable to discontinue corticosteroids without a 
relapse in disease activity (reviewed in Dignass et al. 2012). Many of these patients require additional 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 194/207 
 
treatment with the next line of therapy, which could include medical treatment with a biologic 
medication or surgical treatment with a colectomy.  
Biologics, including antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab) 
and vedolizumab, an anti-α4β7 integrin antibody, are indicated for the treatment of UC in patients who 
fail to respond to, have an inadequate response to, or are intolerant to other medications used in the 
treatment of UC medications, and as a first-line treatment for UC in selected patients. However, in the 
pivotal ACT1 and ACT2 studies of infliximab therapy in patients with moderately to severely active UC 
and in the pivotal PURSUIT studies of golimumab in the same patient population, only approximately 
50% to 65% of the patients achieved clinical response (as defined by complete Mayo score) at the 
induction time point (Weeks 6 to 8), with approximately 50% of the patients maintaining clinical 
response to Week 54 (Rutgeerts et al. 2005; Sandborn et al. 2014a, 2014b). In the pivotal ULTRA 
studies of adalimumab in the same patient population, 16.5% of patients achieved clinical remission at 
Week 8 (Sandborn et al. 2012a). Similarly, in the pivotal GEMINI 1 study of vedolizumab in patients 
with moderately to severely active disease, 47% achieved a clinical response at Week 6 and up to 45% 
of these patients were in clinical remission at Week 52 (Feagan et al. 2013). 
While the recent approvals of multiple therapies including JAK inhibitors for UC are encouraging, 
clinical trial remission rates for both induction and maintenance treatment in UC remain limited. 
Therefore, there is a continued need for new therapies in UC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies  
The pivotal induction study 
(Study 16T-MC-AMAN) was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Mirikizumab 300mg IV versus 
placebo for up to 12 weeks. The study population included patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) who had an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or are intolerant to 
conventional (nonbiologic) therapy for UC (conventional-failed), and those who had an inadequate 
response to, loss of response to, or are intolerant to biologic therapy for UC (biologic-failed).   
Patients were randomised 3:1 to receive blinded intravenous (IV) administration of 300 mg 
mirikizumab or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) and were stratified on biologic-failed status (yes/no), 
baseline corticosteroid use (yes/no), baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score [MMS]: [4-6] or 
[7-9]), and geographic region (North America/Europe/Other). 
There was no rescue arm in Study AMAN. However, patients who completed Study AMAN through 
Week 12 (with an acceptable safety profile) who did not achieve a clinical response to mirikizumab at 
Week 12 could be eligible to receive an induction dose of mirikizumab in maintenance Study AMBG. At 
the end of Week 12 of the induction period, patients could either:  enter Study I6T-MC-AMBG 
(maintenance study) or discontinue study treatment and complete the post-treatment follow-up 
period.  
The primary endpoint of Study AMAN was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 12. 
Clinical remission per modified mayo score, was defined as SF subscore = 0, or SF subscore = 1 with a 
≥1-point decrease from baseline, RB subscore = 0, and ES = 0 or 1 (excluding friability).  
The pivotal maintenance study 
 (Study I6T-MC-AMBG) was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm, placebo-
controlled maintenance study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC at 
Week 40 (52 weeks of continuous therapy) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 195/207 
 
The study population included patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who 
completed Study AMAN. Treatment depended on the patients’ response and what treatment they were 
receiving in study AMAN. Patients who achieved clinical response with blinded mirikizumab treatment 
during Study AMAN were randomised 2:1 to blinded 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC or blinded placebo 
(randomised withdrawal). Patients who responded to blinded placebo in their induction study remained 
on blinded placebo in Study AMBG. Open-label rescue therapy with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W 
intravenously (IV) was administered for 3 doses if these patients lost response. 
Patients who did not achieve clinical response with either blinded mirikizumab or blinded placebo 
during Study AMAN received open-label extended induction therapy with 300 mg mirikizumab Q4W IV 
administered for 3 doses. Patients who achieved delayed clinical response (defined using induction 
study baseline) received open-label 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC. Induction study non responders who 
did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 of Study AMBG were discontinued. 
Clinical response was based on modified mayo score (MMS) and defined as a decrease from baseline in 
the MMS of ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline and a decrease in rectal bleeding score (RBS) ≥ 1 or 
an RBS of 0 or 1. The primary analysis for the main result were conducted in a subgroup of these 
patients who were randomised 2:1 to blinded 200 mg mirikizumab Q4W SC or blinded placebo.  
The primary endpoint of Study AMBG is the proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 40 
among patients induced into clinical response at Week 12 in Study AMAN. 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
Induction study AMAN: The primary endpoint clinical remission MMS at week 12 was achieved in 
24.2% (n=201) of patients receiving mirikizumab 300 mg IV compared to 13.3 % (n=39) patients on 
placebo. The risk difference was 11.1 % (3.2, 19.1) this was statistically significant p =0.00006. All 
ranked secondary endpoints were statistically significantly better compared to placebo. 
These included:

In the more than 1 biologic or tofacitinib failed subgroup 45.3 % of patients achieved a clinical 
response with mirizukizumab versus 20.8% of patients on placebo risk difference was 24.5% 
(11.4, 37.7) P = 0.001. 
• 
Histologic- Endoscopic Mucosal Improvement ay week 12: A significantly greater percentage of 
patients achieved histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at Week 12 in the mirikizumab-
treatment group compared to the placebo group.   Patients on mirikizumab achieved a 
response in 27.1% of patients (n 235) compared to 13.9% on placebo (n 41). The risk 
difference was 13.4 % (5.5, 21.4) p < 0.00001.

Maintenenace study AMBG: The primary objective of the study was met. Among mirikizumab 
induction responders, mirikizumab was superior to placebo in achieving clinical remission at Week 40 
(Week 52 of continuous therapy) in the mITT population. Patients on mirikizumab 49.9% (n 182) 
compared to placebo 25.1% (n45) risk difference 23.2% (15.2, 31.2) p < 0.001. All ranked secondary

difference -1.06 (-1.51, -0.61) p < 0.001. 
Subgroup analysis by demographic and baseline disease characteristics were conducted for the primary 
and all major secondary endpoints in Study AMAN and Study AMBG. These demonstrated a consistent 
effect across all of the subgroups in favour of mirkizumab treatment. Additionally, favourable effects 
were demonstrated on patients’ quality of life with treatment through validated scoring systems. These 
effects along with the improvements in endpoints above were also supported by demonstration of 
improvement on inflammatory biomarkers with mirikizumab treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
For the Induction treatment there seemed to be a lower response in patients on baseline steroids 
versus those that were not, as well as in patients who failed biological treatment, or JAK inhibitors at 
baseline. The effects seem limited and may take patients a longer time i.e. an additional 12 weeks-3 
doses for patients to achieve a clinical remission, or an adequate clinical response. Patients were 
excluded if they had received or failed 3, or more biologic therapies, therefore in these patients, which 
represent a more difficult to treat population the efficacy is not certain.   
The inclusion criteria enrolled patients with a modified Mayo score (MMS) of 4 to 9 with an endoscopic 
subscore (ES) ≥2, therefore patients beyond this were not included. A description of this details in 5.1 
of the SmPC is included to inform the prescriber which is acceptable to the CHMP. Also, patients with 
UC proctitis (disease limited to the rectum, that is, distal to the recto-sigmoid junction, which lies 
approximately 10-15 cm from anal margin) were excluded it is therefore unclear whether mirikizumab 
would be effective in this population, however these patients are usually treated with localised 
therapies such as steroid enemas and antibiotics. 
For the maintenance phase study, 19 patients who were in remission lost response when they were 
treated with 200 mg sc Q4W, it is unclear whether patients at risk of loss of response can be identified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 197/207 
 
Also, as the duration of the follow up in the maintenance phase was 44 weeks or shorter in case of a 
second induction course additional patients may lose response over a longer duration and require 
rescue treatment with 300mg iv.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects  
In the All UC Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, frequencies of TE elevations in ALT and 
AST ≥3xULN in mirikizumab-treated participants were low however higher (ALT = 2.0%, AST = 2.1%) 
than in participants in the UC Placebo Group (ALT = 1.1%, AST = 0.5%). The difference in the 
frequency of elevated liver enzymes was also seen in studies in other indications.  
In the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set mirikizumab treatment group, there were 
slightly higher frequencies of TE elevations in ALT and AST ≥3xULN (ALT = 3.0%, AST = 2.8%) 
compared with the All Placebo Group (ALT = 1.3%, AST = 0.6%). AST and ALT elevation are defined in 
4.8 of the SmPC. The risk is described under selected adverse reactions in the SmPC and a warning 
statement on regular monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin was added to 4.4 of the SmPC for the 
attention of the prescriber. 
In general, the frequency of infections was higher in the mirikizumab treated patients as compared to 
those on placebo although the deference between the groups was small. During the induction period 
the percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE infection was 14.0% (n = 45) in placebo, and 
15.1% (n = 145) in the mirikizumab group. During the placebo-controlled maintenance period the 
percentage of participants that reported at least 1 TE infection was 22.9% (n = 44) in placebo, and 
23.9% (n = 93) in the mirikizumab group. Due to its mechanism of action mirikizumab may increase 
the risk of severe infection and the SmPC includes a contraindication in case of active tuberculosis and 
a warning that mirikizumab may increase the risk of severe infection and provides guidance in case of 
clinically important acute, chronic, or serious infection. In addition, serious infections are listed as an 
important potential risk for mirikizumab, and these events will be monitored in the post-authorisation 
setting via routine pharmacovigilance activities and as part of the objective of the additional post-
authorisation pharmacovigilance study entitled “Observational Secondary Database Study to Assess 
the Long-Term Safety of Mirikizumab” that is a category 3 study in the RMP. 
Opportunistic infections were infrequently reported. All UC Mirikizumab analysis set opportunistic 
infections were reported in 25 (1.7%) patients’, whereas in all Miri Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
in 71 (1.9%) patients. Serious infections were reported infrequently i.e less than 2.3% in any 
treatment group. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported.   
Infusion site reactions were reported in 8 patients (0.6%) of patients receiving mirikizumab iv. 
Injection site reactions were reported in 8.7% of UC patients. Inactions site pain was the most 
frequently reported.  No serious Injection site reaction were reported. One patient discontinued due to 
a TE Injection site reaction. Injection site reaction cluster are listed in the SmPC which is acceptable. 
The frequency of participants with 1 or more Injection site reactions (HLT) was similar between TE ADA 
negative (8.3%) and TE ADA positive participants (10.2%). Injections and infusion site reactions are 
included in section  4.8 of the SmPC. 
Immediate hypersensitivity events were reported in UC development programme including Infusion 
related reaction (6 patients), infusion related hypersensitivity reaction (4 patients), Hypersensitivity (4 
patients) and rash (3 patients). No anaphylactic reactions were reported in the mirikizumab treated 
patients. Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions are listed in 4.8 of the SmPC and hypersensitivity 
to the active substance of to any of the excipients is a contraindication and adequate precautionary 
statements are included in 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 198/207 
 
For arthralgia a higher frequency was observed in the UC induction period (1.2 % versus 2.1% for 
placebo and mirikizumab, respectively) and the UC maintenance period (3% versus 6.7% for placebo 
and mirikizumab, respectively). Further arthralgia is listed as ADR in the SmPC of other IL-23 inhibitors 
i.e. ustekinumab and guselkumab. Arthralgia was added to the list of ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The frequency of Headache and Headache cluster was higher in patients receiving mirikizumab. All 
headache events were reported as mild or moderate. None were reported as serious or led to study 
treatment discontinuation. Headache is listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects  
On hepatic safety 3 cases which fulfil the criteria for DILI were classified as probably or possibly related 
to treatment with mirikizumab. One case meeting Hy’s Law criteria was particularly concerning as no 
alternative aetiology or significant confounding risk factors were identified in this patient. Further, 
there was small imbalance in the percentage of patients with increased liver enzymes between the 
treatment groups.  
Based on review of cases with a probable or possible association with mirikizumab treatment, 
elevations in hepatic enzymes improved or normalised with or without discontinuation of mirikizumab 
treatment, and none resulted in death, a serious outcome, or other sequelae. Further frequencies of 
elevations of ALT and AST reported in studies with mirikizumab were not higher as seen in studies for 
the products of the same class.  
To balance the risk a warning was introduced in section 4.4 with a recommendation for monthly liver 
monitoring during induction followed by less frequent monitoring during the maintenance therapy. 
Further, if increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 
observed and drug-associated liver injury is suspected, mirikizumab must be discontinued until this 
diagnosis is excluded. Furthermore, cases of elevations in ALT and AST are described in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
Further, to characterise the risk further post marketing severe liver injury was added as an impotent 
potential risk in the RMP and additional pharmacovigilance activities were introduced, including the use 
of a spontaneous hepatic disorders follow-up form and inclusion of severe liver injury as an outcome of 
interest in the observational secondary database study to assess the long-term safety of mirikizumab. 
 
 
Cardiovascular safety 
 
In total, 28 cases of Adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were reported in 
mirikizumab-treated participants in the All Mirikizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set which 
included not only patients with UC but also those treated for other indications such as psoriasis and 
CD.  
In the placebo-controlled period of the mirikizumab psoriasis development programme, a numerical 
imbalance for MACE (placebo = 0; mirikizumab = 5; 0.4% [1.2 IR]) was observed. However, this 
numerical imbalance in participants with psoriasis needs to be interpreted in the context of o 
randomisation differences between placebo- and mirikizumab-treated participants (6:1) and 
subsequently a significant imbalance in the number of patients enrolled to each arm. 
Although a causal relationship of MACE with mirikizumab treatment was not determined based on the 
data presented so far, taking into consideration small imbalances of MACEs in psoriasis studies these 
cases will be monitored post-marketing including in the observational secondary database study 
Assessment report  
EMA/197960/2023  
Page 199/207 
 
planned by the applicant. Further, in line with other IL-23 inhibitors major adverse cardiovascular 
events (MACE) was included as an important potential risk to the RMP. 
Malignancy  
There is no clear evidence of an increased risk for developing malignancies following treatment with 
mirikizumab based on results of the clinical trials presented so far in this application. As there is an 
established increased risk for cancer development in UC and there is a theoretical possibility of 
decreased immune surveillance against malignancies with alteration of immune pathways with 
mirikizumab treatment, malignancy was added Important Potential Risk in the RMP. 
Infections 
Mirikizumab is an immunomodulatory drug and as such, may increase the risk of developing an 
infection or may exacerbate an existing infection. In studies performed by the applicant the frequency 
of infections was higher in the mirikizumab treated patients as compared to those on placebo although 
the deference between the groups was small. Serious infections were reported infrequently i.e. less 
than 2.3% in any treatment group. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported. A warning 
highlighting a potential for an increased risk for infection was added to section 4.4 of the SmPC. In 
addition, this risk will be further monitored and characterised post marketing i.e opportunistic 
infections and serious infections will be monitored by the applicant in the planned observational 
secondary database study as described in the RMP. Serious infections are included in the RMP as an 
Important potential risk.  
Laboratory abnormalities  
In relation to haematology laboratory values in the UC induction period as well as in the UC 
maintenance placebo-controlled period a greater mean decrease in blood monocytes, segmented blood 
neutrophils and blood platelets was noted in the mirikizumab treatment group as compared to the 
placebo group. There is no clear biologic plausibility for an association between decreased monocytes 
or decreased platelets and mirikizumab treatment. Therefore, taking also into consideration the small 
number of cases reported, no update to the SmPC was required.  
Although there is biologic plausibility for low neutrophils in participants treated with mirikizumab, also 
for neutrophils update to the product information was not considered necessary. This was based on the 
fact that the number of cases was small and there was lack of consistent findings in the induction and 
maintenance periods (during maintenance no differences between the treatment group were seen). 
Changes in monocytes, neutrophils and platelets will be monitored post -marketing in the ongoing 
clinical trials and through routine post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy 
The pivotal induction study demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority of 
mirikizumab 300mg iv Q4W compared to placebo in inducing remission in patients with moderate to 
severe ulcerative colitis.  Also, a larger majority of patients achieved a clinically relevant response at 
week 12 compared to placebo. Statistically significant results were demonstrated in favour of 
treatment with mirikizumab for all of the secondary endpoints. 
A heterogeneous population was recruited and while a more significant effect was seen in biological 
naïve patients, the effects seen in more heavily treated patients was considered to be clinically 
relevant. A key secondary endpoint was to examine the effects in patients who had previously failed 
biological or JAK inhibitor treatment and again a consistent beneficial effect was seen with mirikizumab 
treatment. Symptomatic remission was achieved as early as 4 weeks following treatment and 
increased at 12 weeks treatment. When assessing endoscopic and histologic effects, superiority was 
also seen with mirikizumab treatment.  An approximate 2-fold higher response was seen in both 
histological and endoscopic improvement with treatment at 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
In the maintenance study, a lower dose of mirikizumab, 200 mg SC Q4W, was investigated.  The 
overall results again were in favour of mirikizumab treatment compared to placebo for the primary and 
all key secondary endpoints. The applicant also demonstrated more than 2-fold higher response rate in 
favour of mirikizumab in endoscopic improvement, corticosteroid free remission and histological and 
endoscopic response at week 40, which are all considered clinically relevant. 
Overall, the treatment effect is considered to be clinically relevant and in line with other approved 
products with the same indication, although it is acknowledged that a formal comparison between 
products is not possible.  
For part of the intended indication the applicant had initially sought a claim in patients who had failed, 
or were intolerant to Janus kinase inhibitors, however, it seems that the only member of this class of 
medications investigated was tofacitinib. The number of patients who had failed tofacitinib alone at 
baseline was rather low (6 placebo, 34 mirikizumab). This was therefore raised as a concern, and the 
applicant has acknowledged this and removed the relevant text from the indication. The applicant has 
also removed a reference to section 5.1 as requested by the CHMP. 
In addition, the applicant was seeking to include “(…), or, have medical contraindications to such 
therapies” in the indication statement. The applicant was asked to delete this text as any such 
statement is considered inappropriate in this section of the SmPC, and the applicant has done so. 
The indication now sought by the applicant is: 
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy, or a biologic treatment or a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, or have medical 
contraindications to such therapies (see section 5.1). 
This updated indication claim is consistent with the development programme and the results provided 
and therefore acceptable.

A Case of Hy’s Law was identified in a patient enrolled to the OL extended induction period and 
receiving the highest dose of mirikizumab (i.e 5 doses of mirikizumab 300 mg Q4W IV). As indicated 
by the applicant, the elevation in liver enzymes for this participant is most likely due to an idiosyncratic 
drug-induced liver injury.  
The following risk mitigation measures were implemented and are considered to mitigate and further 
characterise sufficiently this important potential risk: 
A warning in section 4.4 was introduced with a recommendation for monthly liver monitoring during an 
induction followed by less frequent monitoring during the maintenance therapy. Severe liver injury was 
added as an impotent potential risk in the RMP and additional pharmacovigilance activities were 
introduced, including the use of spontaneous hepatic disorders follow-up form and inclusion of severe 
liver injury as an outcome of interest in the observational secondary database study to assess the 
long-term safety of mirikizumab. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks  
The benefit risk for mirikizumab 300mg iv Q4W and 200 mg sc Q4W for treatment of UC is considered 
positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions  
The overall benefit/risk balance of Omvoh is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Omvoh is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Omvoh is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic treatment  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

Not applicable 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that mirikizumab is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.
