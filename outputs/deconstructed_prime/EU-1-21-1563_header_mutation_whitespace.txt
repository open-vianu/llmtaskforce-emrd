1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission  of the  dossier 
The applicant bluebird bio (Netherlands) B.V submitted on 10 September 2020 an application for 
Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Skysona, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
Skysona, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1003 on 6 June 2012. Skysona was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  Treatment of 
adrenoleukodystrophy. 
Skysona was granted eligibility to PRIME on 26 July 2018 in the following indication:  for the treatment 
of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy.  
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
CALD is a serious and life-threatening condition. The only therapeutic intervention currently 
available to CALD patients is allo-HSCT for about less than 30% of patients who have access to 
this donor cell source. Allo HSCT is associated with significant transplant-related morbidity and 
mortality, including increased risk for graft failure, graft-versus-host disease. Thus, the unmet 
medical need is agreed.  
• 
Skysona will target patients currently not eligible for allo-HSCT therapy. Preliminary clinical 
data from 17 treated patients show that the 24 months major functional disabilities (MFD) free 
survival is 88.2% compared with data from 22 patients treated with allo-HSCT showing a 24-
month MFD-free survival rate of 71%.  
• 
The magnitude of the effect could be larger than allo-HSCT and the possibility to treat patients 
not eligible for allo-HSCT will offer an additional therapeutic option for these patients currently 
not eligible for allo-HSCT due to the absence of donors.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Skysona is indicated for the treatment of patients less than 18 years of age with an ABCD1 genetic 
mutation and early cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy for whom a human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not available. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Following the CAT/CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Skysona as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Skysona  
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0290/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 8/136 
 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0290/2018 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0290/2018  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance elivaldogene autotemcel contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
P RIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Lisbeth Barkholt was appointed by the CAT as rapporteur. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 10 December 2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Post-approval evidence generation including design of a long-term observational registry study

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare, X-linked, metabolic disease in which dysfunction or lack of the 
ALD protein (ALDP) is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D member 1 
(ABCD1) gene. ALDP is a peroxisomal transport protein involved in the transport and degradation of 
very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), leading to accumulation of VLCFAs, which occurs most prominently 
in the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord.  
Cerebral ALD (CALD) is the most severe form of ALD, affecting approximately 40% of boys with ALD, 
typically during childhood. CALD is characterised by rapidly progressive cerebral demyelination leading 
to progressive, irreversible loss of neurologic function. If untreated, nearly half of patients with CALD 
die within 5 years of symptom onset. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and screening tools 
The worldwide incidence of ALD among newborn males has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 
21,000 among live births, but incidences between 1:17,000 to 1:100,000 have been reported 
(Wiesinger et al., 2015). There appears to be no major differences in incidence rates of ALD between 
countries around the world. There is no genotype-phenotype correlation, i.e. whether a newborn child 
genetically diagnosed with a mutated ABCD1 gene will develop the aggressive form cerebral ALD 
during childhood (normally between 2-12 years of age) or only milder disease in adult age cannot be 
determined based on the type of gene mutation. 
The 2 most common neurologic ALD phenotypes manifestations are childhood cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which together account for 
approximately 80% of all cases. AMN is characterised by slowly progressive predominantly axonal 
degeneration and affects the spinal cord and to a lesser extent peripheral nerves and typically develop 
during adulthood. In contrast, childhood CALD is characterised by rapidly progressive cerebral 
demyelination, resulting in death or vegetative state in most patients within 3 years of onset.

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 12/136 
 
Newborn screening programmes for ALD are underway in several countries; the Minister of Health in 
the Netherlands has approved the addition of adrenoleukodystrophy to the newborn screening 
programme. In the USA, ALD was added to the recommended uniform screening panel in 2016.  
For boys with a genetic diagnosis of ALD, monitoring of white matter involvement by magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is used to objectively determine the onset of CALD signs and 
identify patients at high risk for rapid progression (i.e. the subgroup of 40% who develop CALD). When 
signs of CALD have developed, the patient should be treated. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
It is not known why 40% of boys with a genetic diagnosis will develop the rapidly progressive cerebral 
demyelination form of ALD, the cerebral ALD (CALD). There is no genotype-phenotype correlation. 
However, in some cases, head trauma appears to have been some kind of trigger, preceding the 
development of neuroinflammation and cerebral ALD.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Disease progression and neurologic decline in patients with CALD have been documented in natural 
history studies; patients experience critical deficits across multiple neurological domains within a short 
period after onset of clinical symptoms. In children diagnosed with CALD, learning and behavioural 
problems are often observed at the time of disease onset in early- to mid-childhood (median age 7 
years) with progressive gait, vision, and hearing impairments within 6 to 15 months of symptom onset. 
This is typically followed by rapid neurologic functional decline. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is currently no medicine approved for treatment of CALD.  
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a therapeutic option that has been 
used for a few decades and that can stabilize progression of CALD. The best outcomes are observed if 
it is performed at early stages of cerebral involvement. 
Allo-HSCT is thought to enable migration of donor-derived cells into the brain, which include donor-
derived macrophages and/or microglial cells that express functional ALDP and function normally, 
thereby stopping further demyelination. Although allo-HSCT has been reported to stabilize CALD, the 
full effects of transplant are not immediately apparent; demyelinating lesions usually continue to 
progress for 12 to 18 months post-transplant with some clinical progression observed. No effect has 
been seen on other disease manifestations of ALD, such as adrenal insufficiency, and the slowly 
developing spinal and peripheral nerves neuropathy in adulthood. It is anticipated that Skysona will 
only have beneficial effects on the cerebral inflammation part of the disease, just as has been observed 
for allo-HSCT treatment. 
Allo-HSCT procedure also involves a pre-transplant myeloablative and lymphocyte-depleting 
conditioning regimen. In addition, because the cells received are allogenic, not autologous, the patient 
may also receive immunosuppressive therapy for several months and sometimes for years after 
transplant, depending on the degree of incompatibility between the host and donor cells.  
Allo-HSCT has potential complications, including risks for transplant-related mortality, graft failure, 
graft-versus-host disease, and infection. These risks are decreased in patients who have a human 
leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor; which fewer than 30% of patients have. Current treatment 
options for those without an HLA-matched sibling donor include allo-HSCT with cells derived from an 
HLA-mismatched related donor or from a matched or mismatched unrelated donor, including banked

cord blood. For those receiving alternative donor source cells, the risk of acute or chronic graft versus 
host disease is higher from an unrelated donor (50.0% for matched unrelated donor and 81.5% for 
unmatched unrelated donor) versus 25.0% for those receiving cells from a matched related donor. 
There is a high unmet medical need for efficacious therapies for CALD that have an improved safety 
profile compared to allo-HSCT, especially for those who do not have a matched sibling donor. 
About the product 
Skysona drug product consists of an autologous CD34+ cell-enriched population containing cells 
transduced with lentiviral vector that encodes an ABCD1 cDNA for human ALDP. This is classified as an 
ATMP, more specifically a gene therapy. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected by apheresis from each patient following mobilisation. 
The autologous haematopoietic progenitor cells obtained by apheresis are enriched for cells expressing 
CD34, and the CD34+ cells are stimulated ex vivo with a mixture of recombinant human cytokines to 
facilitate cell growth. Next, the cells are transduced with Lenti-D lentiviral vector. After transduction, 
the cells are washed, resuspended in the cryopreservation solution, and filled in bags before controlled 
freezing to -140°C. On the day of infusion, the eli-cel drug product is thawed and infused intravenously 
as a single dose without additional processing steps at the clinical site. 
The minimum recommended dose of Skysona is 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg. If the minimum dose of 
Skysona 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg is not met after initial medicinal product manufacturing, the patient 
may undergo one or more additional cycles of mobilisation and apheresis, separated by at least 
14 days, in order to obtain more cells for additional manufacture. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
Accelerated assessment 
The CHMP and CAT agreed with the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product 
was considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following:  
CALD is a rare, rapidly progressive fatal genetic disease with the only disease-modifying available 
treatment being allo-HSCT. The standard therapeutic method (allo-HSCT) is effective but is associated 
with mortality and morbidity related to GVHD and graft failure, especially in those patients for whom 
an HLA-matched donor cannot be found. In addition, there is a need for life-long immunosuppression 
after allo-HSCT. Since the CALD disease progression is rapid once signs have developed, it is also 
important that a suitable donor is identified promptly. Children with CALD for whom an HLA-matching 
is not available (70% of all CALD cases) have an imminent unmet medical need. It is agreed with the 
applicant that Skysona has the potential to address this unmet medical need and to bring a therapeutic 
advantage to patients with CALD. With the use of the patient’s own HSCs, the search for a suitable 
donor can be skipped, which saves valuable time for the patient with this rapidly progressive disease. 
Thus, the applicant’s view that this new substance constitutes a major interest from the point of view 
of public health is supported. 
Skysona represents a major therapeutic innovation with a new mechanism of action, i.e. autologous 
haematopoietic cells transduced with a lenti-viral vector containing the ABCD1 gene cDNA. Following 
engraftment, these cells migrate into the CNS where they differentiate into macrophages and cerebral 
microglia which produce functional human adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP).  
Skysona may alter the outcome of untreated CALD and arrest disease progression in a way similar to 
that observed with allo-HSCT, but with the safety advantage of a lower risk of GVHD or graft failures.

However, during assessment the CAT and CHMP reverted the evaluation to a standard timetable, as 
although all major objections had been solved, clarifications were still needed at Day150. With regards 
to the quality dossier, the pending points pertained to tightening of specification limits and confirmation 
of contractual agreements to ensure traceability throughout the albumin supply chains. In relation to the 
clinical dossier, the pending clarifications referred to the indication wording, variability of outcomes, the 
potential risk of insertional oncogenesis and the finalisation of the Product Information.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product Skysona (also referred to as eli-cel or Lenti-D) is presented as a dispersion for 
infusion containing 2 to 30 x 106 cells/ml of an autologous CD34+ cell-enriched population that 
contains haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding ABCD1 cDNA for 
human adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) as active substance. The cells are suspended in Cryostore 
CS5 cryopreservation solution containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The product is available in 20 
ml fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) infusion bag(s), each packed in a transparent pouch inside a 
metal cassette. One lot of finished product may be packaged in either one or two 20 mL bags, 
depending on the total number of cells present. Multiple lots may be administered to the patient as a 
single dose. 
Although this dossier is not considered a Quality by Design application, certain elements of an 
enhanced approached were applied. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance consists of autologous CD34+ cell-enriched population that contains 
haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding ABCD1 cDNA and is 
produced from two starting materials, the lentiviral vector (referred to as Lenti-D LVV) and 
haematopoietic progenitor cells obtained by apheresis (HPC-A). 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the lentiviral vector and part 
2 for the transduced autologous cells. The active substance (transduced autologous cells) is formulated 
directly into the finished product in a continuous process, by formulation in the cryopreservation 
solution and filling into cryopreservation bags.  
Part 1: Lentiviral vector 
General information (lentiviral vector)  
The Lenti-D LVV is a replication-incompetent, self-inactivating (SIN), HIV-1-based LVV pseudotyped 
with the envelope glycoprotein G from the vesicular stomatitis virus. The function of Lenti-D LVV is to 
transfer the RNA genome into CD34+ cells. Viral enzymes reverse transcribes the viral RNA into DNA 
and integrate the proviral DNA carrying the human adrenoleukodystrophy (ABCD1) gene into the 
CD34+ cell genome. Due to the absence of viral genes in the LVV, the integrated proviral form is 
incapable of replication.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (lentiviral vector) 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (lentiviral vector) 
Adequate information on areas of responsibility for manufacturing and test sites for Lenti-D LVV has 
been provided as required, including confirmation that necessary control measures are in place at 
bluebird bio, which ensure that the manufacturers of starting materials adhere to the principles of 
GMP.  
In brief, the manufacturing process comprises thawing of HEK293T cells from one vial of the WCB, 
expansion of HEK293T cells to reach the intended viable cell number for the transfection step, 
preparation of the transfection cocktail, transfection and LVV production, harvest and purification 
steps, filtration and filling.  
For each process step, critical process parameters (CPPs), non-CPPs, and in-process controls (IPCs) 
are provided. The CPPs and non-CPPs are controlled within specified ranges.  
The information provided on the manufacturing process, process parameters, and process controls for 
Lenti-D LVV is sufficient.  
Lenti-D LVV vials are stored frozen. After release, the vials may be shipped to a long-term storage 
facility or to an active substance manufacturing site under controlled temperature conditions.  
Temperature monitoring is performed during transit of all Lenti-D LVV shipments. 
Control of materials (lentiviral vector) 
The materials of biological origin used in the Lenti-D LVV manufacturing process (other than plasmids 
and HEK293T cell banks, see below) are described. Materials of biological origin are accepted for use in 
manufacturing based on successful inspection of the supplier’s certificate of analysis (CoA). 
Information demonstrating that materials meet standards appropriate for their intended use, including 
source, manufacture, and characterisation are provided and deemed acceptable for their purposes. 
HEK293T Cells  
The modified, human, embryonic, kidney cell-line, designated HEK293T, is the mammalian packaging 
cell line used as the cell substrate in the Lenti-D LVV transfection process. Information on the source, 
history and generation of the cell line is provided. 
A master cell bank (MCB) and WCBs of HEK293T cells have been established under GMP and in 
accordance with Ph.Eur. 5.2.3 and ICH Q5D. Information on the manufacture and qualification of the 
MCB and WCBs is provided. 
WCBs were tested in accordance with ICH Guideline Q5D with regards to identity, viability, and 
absence of viral and non-viral contaminants. Brief but adequate descriptions of the analytical methods 
applied for qualification of the cell banks are provided. All test results met specification and the WCBs

were shown to be free of contamination by bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma, and virus as summarised in 
the dossier. The results support their use in the manufacturing of the LVV. 
Assessment of adventitious agents is done through test methods utilising in vitro and in vivo 
techniques. Foetal bovine serum is tested by PCR for absence of adventitious viruses in accordance 
with CFR 9 (Code of Federal Regulations, USA) prior to gamma-irradiation, which is deemed an 
acceptable approach. 
No significant trends were identified over the in vitro age range with respect to cell viability, total 
viable cells, population doubling time, or cell morphology. These results demonstrate the stability of 
the cell bank system with respect to manufacturing consistency across the in vitro age range used in 
manufacturing. Also, the stability and performance of HEK293T WCBs are monitored for each Lenti-D 
LVV manufacturing run. 
HEK293T cells were expanded during an engineering run and collected prior to transfection to generate 
an end of production cell bank (EOPCB). Testing in accordance with ICH Q5D demonstrated that the 
HEK293T EOPCB was free of detectable bacteria, fungi and adventitious viruses and support the use of 
the WCB. 
Plasmids 
A multi-plasmid system, consisting of a transfer plasmid (pLBP100) that carries the ABCD1 (ATP-
binding cassette, sub-family D, member 1) gene, which encodes the human adrenoleukodystrophy 
protein (ALDP), and packaging plasmids is used to manufacture Lenti-D LVV by transient transfection 
of HEK293T cells. Expression of the ABCD1 transgene is controlled by an internal enhancer/promoter 
derived from the unique 3’ region of murine myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) with a negative 
control region deletion (i.e., an internal MNDU3 enhancer/promoter). Information on the structural 
elements, associated plasmid maps and full sequence information for the plasmids is provided. 
The plasmid production site is qualified and managed by the applicant, in accordance with their quality 
management system and the plasmids are manufactured according to the applicant’s specifications. 
Adherence to principles of GMP is ensured by the quality system in place, including audits being 
performed regularly. 
A flow diagram and brief narrative description of the plasmid manufacturing process have been 
provided, including information of process parameters and in-process controls. Individual WCBs are 
used for the manufacture of each of the plasmids. The manufacturing process consists of fermentation 
and harvest, a downstream purification process, ending up with final filtration, filling and storage. 
Stability has been verified for the proposed shelf-life. 
The manufacturing process performance has been evaluated with regards to process control and 
consistency, aseptic manufacturing, sterilising grade filter validation, cleaning validation, and shipping 
validation. 
The information provided on the manufacturer and the manufacturing process is considered adequate. 
Certificates of Analysis have been provided for all cell banks. The generation and qualification of the 
cell banks, including master, working and end of production cell banks, is in accordance with the 
requirements of Ph. Eur. 5.14.  
The release specifications are accordance with Ph. Eur. 5.14. Brief, but sufficient descriptions have 
been provided of the analytical methods and the requirements set for validity of the results obtained. A 
validation summary has been provided, which indicates that all analytical methods have been 
sufficiently validated (non-compendial) or verified (compendial). The information provided is 
considered sufficient.

Control of Critical Steps and Intermediates (lentiviral vector) 
Please refer to the process characterisation section below. 
Process Validation (lentiviral vector) 
Under a prospective validation protocol, the Lenti-D LVV commercial manufacturing process was 
validated by demonstrating that the process performed consistently and met pre-established 
acceptance criteria, when executed within defined operating ranges. Process performance qualification 
(PPQ) runs were successfully completed within the normal CPP and non-CPP operating ranges (NORs). 
All results met the acceptance criteria.  
In the context of aseptic filling for LVV manufacturing, data show that no vials in any media fill 
simulation were positive for microbial growth. 
Process characterisation data and classification of process parameters and establishment of proven 
acceptable ranges (PAR) are presented. The results have laid the basis for the commercial process 
control strategy. The relationship between unit operation parameters and quality attributes is 
presented as well as the location of IPCs. Furthermore, the final LVV testing as part of lot release and 
product characterisation testing is also described. The strategy deciding criticality of quality attributes, 
as presented by the applicant, is deemed relevant. 
The Lenti-D LVV transport is performed using refrigerated shipping systems. Shipping runs (runs with 
minimal load and maximal load for each shipping system size), were performed under-estimated 
worst-case conditions with regards to duration (distance) and outside temperature. For all runs the 
acceptance criteria of product temperature range and time to reach target temperature were met. No 
damage to packaging system or load was observed.  
Overall, the validation studies performed are considered appropriate and the process, aseptic 
performance, sterilising-grade filter, and shipping conditions are considered successfully validated. 
Manufacturing Process Development (lentiviral vector) 
The Lenti-D LVV manufacturing process was developed at bluebird bio and transferred. The same 
manufacturing process has been used throughout the development although minor improvements were 
made as additional knowledge was gained. The results are in support of the changes and deemed 
acceptable. 
Process characterisation 
Process parameters subjected to process characterisation studies were selected through Failure Modes 
and Effect (FMEA) based risk ranking from evaluation of their potential impact on the identified critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) and non-CQAs.  
Overall, the procedure used for process parameter classification is considered scientifically sound and 
appropriate and the process characterisation studies conducted are considered adequate. The 
justifications provided for the established process parameters classifications and the corresponding 
PARs are considered scientifically sound and acceptable. 
Control strategy 
Relevant CQAs have been established for the Lenti-D LVV process and ensures Lenti-D LVV of the 
intended quality. The quality attributes classified as critical are all addressed in the release 
specifications. The justifications given for the selection of control elements made and the overall 
control strategy in place are considered appropriate and capable of ensuring a consistent manufacture 
of Lenti-D LVV product of the intended quality.

Characterisation (lentiviral vector) 
Structure 
Lenti-D LVV batches were subjected to characterisation with regards to structure in terms of viral 
protein profiling and detection by capillary electrophoretic (CE) separation followed by 
chemiluminescent detection of total proteins or identification through detection using virus protein 
specific antibodies. The identity of the viral proteins necessary to form functional LVV and their 
presence throughout process development, have been confirmed. 
- particle size distribution: Overall, consistent particle sizes within the expected size of a lentivirus 
were observed.  
- total nanoparticle tracking analysis: Overall, consistent number of nanoparticles/mL were observed.  
 Biological activity 
The biological/functional activity of the Lenti-D LVV is characterised through demonstration of 
transduction efficiency. Batches of Lenti-D LVV have been subjected to characterisation of the 
biological/functional activity, including batches used for clinical manufacture and the PPQ batches 
manufactured.  
The determination of structure and biological activity is considered adequate and in accordance with EU 
guidance.  
Impurities 
Lenti-D product- and process- related impurities are presented, and relevant controls are included in 
the release specifications. The information on process-related impurities identifies whether each 
impurity is monitored during release testing or evaluated during characterisation studies of the Lenti-D 
LVV or manufacturing process. The ability of the Lenti-D LVV manufacturing process to reduce the 
levels of the impurities was evaluated during process development.  
The Lenti-D LVV manufacturing process carries the theoretical risk for generation of RCL. This risk is 
mitigated by the design of the plasmids used to transfect the HEK 293T cells. The absence of RCL is 
confirmed through release testing. No evidence of RCL generation during LVV manufacturing using this 
plasmid system has been observed to date. 
The impurities potentially present in Lenti-D LVV are considered adequately characterised. The control 
strategy in terms of reduction and determination of residual levels of impurities is considered well 
justified. 
Specification (lentiviral vector) 
 
The release and stability specifications for the Lenti-D LVV cover potency, identity, safety, purity, 
appearance, and quality. In general, the justifications provided for the Lenti-D LVV specifications are 
considered scientifically sound, adequate and acceptable. 
Analytical methods (lentiviral vector) 
Summary descriptions of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing are provided. 
The descriptions are considered sufficiently detailed and the methods applied fit for the purpose.  
Adequate descriptions of the validation or verification (for compendial methods) studies and results 
have been provided, demonstrating that the validation has been conducted in accordance with ICH Q2.  
 Batch analysis (lentiviral vector)

Batches of Lenti-D LVV, including PPQ batches, were used to establish the commercial specification. 
Overall, the release data indicate consistent quality of the Lenti-D LVV batches manufactured 
throughout process development.  
Reference materials (lentiviral vector) 
The reference standard has been prepared from a Lenti-D-LVV batch manufactured using the intended 
commercial manufacturing process. Based on the data provided, the primary Lenti-D LVV reference 
standard is considered sufficiently qualified and fit for purpose. 
As required, a stability protocol and a description of the strategy for introducing a new reference 
standard have been included. Both are considered acceptable. 
Container Closure System (lentiviral vector) 
Lenti-D LVV is filled into vials that are stoppered with elastomeric stoppers and capped. The vial and 
stopper are the Lenti-D LVV contact portions of the container and both are of compendial quality.  
An extractable study was performed to generate an extractable profile for the vial and stopper when in 
contact with the final formulation of Lenti-D LVV. The study design evaluated extracted compounds and 
elements from simulated worst-case process conditions. Based on the extractable testing performed on 
the vial, stopper and the container closure system it is concluded that the configuration is appropriate 
for the intended use.  
The container closure system is considered fit for the current purpose.  
Stability (lentiviral vector) 
Lenti-D LVV batches have been placed on stability, including the PPQ batches, at the intended long-
term storage condition to demonstrate the biological and physical stability through the proposed shelf-
life. The containers used for stability studies are identical to those used under routine manufacture. All 
long-term, real-time stability data comply with the specifications in place at the time of testing. Lenti-D 
LVV batches have been stored and remain within specification, thus supporting the proposed shelf-life. 
The long-term stability studies are ongoing. Accelerated stability studies are completed and data 
remain within specification for the duration of the studies. The proposed Lenti-D LVV shelf-life, using 
the container closure system described, is supported by the stability data provided and is acceptable. 
A commitment has been given to continue the stability studies post-approval and to report any 
confirmed OOS result to the relevant authorities.  
Part 2: transduced autologous cells 
General Information (transduced autologous cells) 
The active substance (INN: elivaldogene autotemcel) is a genetically modified autologous CD34+ cell-
enriched population that contains haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with LVV encoding 
ABCD1 cDNA for human adrenoleukodystrophy protein. 
Cells transduced with Lenti-D LVV contain integrated copies of the ABCD1 transgene, encoding the 
functional human ALDP which is a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in the transport and 
metabolism of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). 
Eli-cel active substance is identical to the finished product, except that the finished product is 
resuspended in cryopreservation solution in the final immediate container for the intended medical use. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 20/136 
 
The eli-cel finished product is intended for treatment of patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy 
(CALD), derived from mutations in the ABDC1 gene, which result in diminished or absent ALDP 
expression and/or function and subsequent accumulation of VLCFAs within multiple tissues. Within the 
central nervous system and brain, this accumulation of VLCFAs is associated with inflammation and 
neurodegeneration. Thus, the desired mode of action of eli-cel is to replace the dysfunctional ABCD1 
gene with the Lenti-D LVV encoded functional one and hereby restore cellular transport and 
metabolism of VLCFA in CALD patients. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (transduced autologous 
cells) 
Active substance manufacturing and in-process testing takes place at Minaris Regenerative Medicine 
GmbH., Ottobrunn, Germany (previously referred to as apceth). MIA and GMP certificate references 
are provided.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (transduced autologous cells) 
The manufacture of active substance/finished product is a continuous process. A high-level description 
of the manufacturing process has been provided including a flow diagram, information on media used, 
the objective and a short narrative of each process step, and tabular overviews of critical and non-
critical process parameters and in-process controls. Briefly, mononuclear cells are separated from 
platelets and other plasma components in the starting material HPC-A by centrifugation and washing 
and CD34+ cells are further enriched. After enrichment, first a pre-transduction stimulation is 
performed and then the cells are transduced with Lenti-D LVV. Cells are then washed and re-
suspended, resulting in the active substance.  
The information provided for the manufacturing process is considered adequate.  
Control of materials (transduced autologous cells) 
The starting materials used in the manufacturing process are presented. Starting materials include 
plasmids and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells which are used to manufacture Lenti-D 
LVV (details presented above in the lentiviral vector section), the Lenti-D LVV and autologous 
haematopoietic progenitor cells obtained by apheresis (HPC-A). 
HPC-A 
Procurement of cell starting material is performed in compliance with European Union (EU) Directive 
2004/23/EC and implementing Directives 2006/17/EC, 2006/86/EC (as amended by Directive 
2015/565), and 2015/566 (referred to as “Tissue Directives”). The program is additionally designed to 
comply with EU Directive 2002/98/EC and implementing directives (“Blood Directives”). The collection 
of autologous cells for commercial manufacture of eli-cel is performed by Qualified Treatment Centres 
(QTCs), which may include an Apheresis Collection Centre (ACC), a Cell Therapy Lab (CTL) and/or a 
finished product cryostorage location and infusion centre. QTCs are certified or licensed as either 
Tissue or Blood Establishments in accordance with national legislation implementing relevant EU 
Directives. QTCs are additionally qualified by the applicant following a programme sufficiently 
described in the application and involving apheresis assessment, quality audits, quality agreements, 
on-site training and a follow-up and maintenance programme. The approach is considered adequate. 
Information on donor selection is provided. Donor screening and testing of prospective eli-cel patients 
is performed for the presence of specific infectious diseases prior to the collection of HPC-A. Infectious 
disease testing is performed by labs that are appropriately qualified using appropriately certified or 
approved test kits (CE-marked). Since HPC-A is for autologous use, positive test results may not 
necessarily prevent its use for the manufacture of eli-cel. In certain cases, additional tests for

infectious disease markers may be performed to rule in or out persisting infection. The infectious 
disease testing strategy to determine acceptance of HPC-A is sufficiently described and deemed 
acceptable. 
A brief description of the HPC-A collection process is provided. Collection of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is performed following standard operating procedures. The apheresis 
collection devices and kits are specified, and CE-declarations of conformity are provided. 
The HPC-A from a single mobilisation cycle is used to support production of one batch of finished 
product. If necessary, an additional mobilisation cycle may be subsequently completed following a pre-
defined time interval to collect additional cells that will support manufacture of a supplemental finished 
product batch to achieve the finished product patient dose.  
Characterisation data for HPC-A material used in the manufacturing of batches used in the clinical 
development (studies ALD-102 and ALD-104) are provided.  
The shipping system for HPC-A has been qualified using a risk-based approach through both 
Operational Qualification (OQ, performed by both the vendor and by the applicant) and Performance 
Qualification (PQ). In addition, shipping qualification studies were performed for worst-case simulated 
conditions, including atmospheric condition, shock (dropping) and vibration test regimes posed upon 
HPC-A samples. 
Raw materials 
An overview of the raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process is presented, 
including representative CoAs or certificates of conformance (CoCs). In general, the provided 
information demonstrates appropriate quality of the raw materials.  
Transfer pack containers and cell culture bags of varying sizes, tubing and cell separation kits used in 
the active substance production are sterilised and single use. Representative certificates of analysis are 
provided. Based on a risk assessment, an extractable study was performed for the cell processor kit 
and the cell culture bag. No safety concern was identified. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates (transduced autologous cells) 
An overview of the IPCs and their action limits included in the active substance manufacturing process 
is provided. Furthermore, according to the description of the manufacturing process, additional 
sampling is included after each step. 
The limits of the currently proposed IPCs are considered sufficiently justified. 
Process validation  
As the manufacturing process of Skysona is continuous, process validation is discussed in the finished 
product section. 
 
Manufacturing process development (transduced autologous cells) 
The description of eli-cel active substance manufacturing process development includes an overview of 
the manufacturing process history that describes changes introduced during clinical development and 
compares clinical manufacturing results across multiple manufacturing sites, an overview of the 
approaches employed for process design and development with justifications for the use of healthy 
donor cell HPC-A and scale-down models, results from process characterisation studies, and a process 
control strategy (PCS) summary for the commercial manufacturing process.

Overall, the same manufacturing process has been used throughout the eli-cel active substance 
manufacturing process history, although minor process improvements were made as additional 
knowledge was gained. 
Comparability 
Throughout development, clinical trial materials were manufactured at several sites. During process 
transfer between sites and upon defining the commercial process, minor sequential adjustments of the 
process were made. A site-to-site comparison was conducted with eli-cel material from the 
manufacturing sites used during clinical development. The strategy is considered adequate. 
The analytical approach includes a classification of attributes based on their potential impact to product 
quality, safety or efficacy and corresponding development of acceptance criteria following a risk-based 
approach. The risk classification is clearly described and considered adequate.  
 The data provided support comparability between sites.  
Process development studies  
Process development studies (process characterisation and PPQ) were conducted using surrogate cells. 
Results are provided to show that data generated with surrogate cells (at-scale engineering run data) 
can be extrapolated to product obtained from CALD patients. Justification of the use of surrogate cells 
in development studies is based on a comparison of in process and final product attributes of 
engineering batches with data from clinical batches. Data provided support the use of surrogate cells 
as model for patient cells.  
A scale-down model was developed to enable design of experiment (DoE) studies for both process 
development and characterisation studies. 
An evaluation of the eli-cel quality attributes was conducted following quality risk management 
principles. The risk-based approach used to assess the criticality of each quality attribute included an 
evaluation of the severity of impact and the uncertainty of knowledge with regards to its clinical 
impact. Quality attributes related to safety, identity, strength, potency, purity, process-related 
impurities, LVV-related impurities and general attributes  have been addressed. 
Process parameters were assessed for potential impact to quality attributes. Individual parameters 
were assigned a risk score based on severity, occurrence and detection, using a Failure Mode and 
Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach. Parameters with a risk score above a pre-established threshold were 
designated for further process characterisation. This results in a selection of process parameters for 
further evaluation using DOE, one factor at a time, or a combination of both approaches at different 
scales. The provided summaries of the process characterisation, although brief, are considered 
sufficient to assess the impact of process parameters on study output attributes and consequently to 
support the proposed parameter classification and PARs.  
Characterisation (transduced autologous cells) 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
Characterisation studies were performed on retains from eli-cel batches used in clinical studies. 
Multiple attributes and correlations were analysed including VCN of all cells and colony-forming-cells, 
the percentage of cells with integrating transgene and the percentage of LVV+ eli-cel colonies, 
percentage of eli-cel cells expressing ALDP and its functional impact, retention of the capability to form 
colonies as well as phenotypic cellular composition. State-of-the-art-methods were applied and the 
results confirmed the expected quality attributes.  
VCN

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 23/136 
 
Orthogonal methods were used to evaluate VCN. The theoretical risk of tumorigenesis in colonies with 
high VCN values for the subpopulations of eli-cel has been sufficiently discussed and the control 
strategy in place for mitigating this risk is considered adequate.  
%LVV+ cells 
Orthogonal %LVV+ (percentage of transduced cells) measurements provide similar estimates of the 
transduction efficiency in both the microglia progenitors and in eli-cel cells that engraft the bone 
marrow. 
 %ALDP+ Cells and Potency by VLCFA Reduction 
Quantitative flow cytometry is used to determine the percent of cells that express ALDP in both eli-cel 
retains and in matched, untransduced patient CD34+ cells from the same subject. In all analysed eli-
cel batches successful expression of ALDP from the ABCD1 cDNA was detected. 
A substrate reduction characterisation assay is used to investigate whether the expressed ALDP protein 
is functional.  
Correlations between eli-cel attributes and clinical biomarkers 
No differential relationship could be established between eli-cel attributes and the clinical outcome as 
determined by the occurrence of major functional disability (MFD) or Neurologic Function Score (NFS) 
change from Baseline at Month 24, most probably due to the reduced number of patients developing 
negative clinical outcomes. Additional clinical biomarkers were included in the characterisation studies 
to further investigate the relevance of eli-cel attributes for clinical efficacy. The results presented 
demonstrated correlations between VCN and peripheral blood (PB) VCN at Month 6; VCN and PB 
%ALDP+ cells at Month 6 as well as between %LVV+ cells and PB %ALDP+ cells at Month 6. 
Characterisation of eli-cel colony-forming activity 
A colony forming assay is used to investigate whether eli-cel cells are maintaining their ability to form 
colonies. Data presented indicate that all eli-cel lots were able to form colonies, and that colony-
forming capacity of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is not lost during transduction 
with Lenti-D LVV and manufacturing process. 
Impurities 
A comprehensive list of the potential process-related impurities together with the steps at which these 
reagents are introduced in the manufacturing process and the analytical methods used for detection is 
provided. Their criticality is defined based on the potential risks posed by the presence of these 
process-related impurities in the active substance. Short descriptions of the methods used for impurity 
characterisation as well as defined limit of quantitation (LoQ) and/or limit of detection (LoD) for these 
assays are provided.  
Product related impurities have been adequately addressed in terms of CD34- cells, untransduced cells 
and non-viable cells, which all are controlled in the finished product release specification. Furthermore, 
extensive deep phenotypic characterisation was performed using different methods, demonstrating 
that the percentage of other cellular impurities (T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, granulocytes, NK cells) is 
low. 
Specification (transduced autologous cells)

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The finished product is presented as a dispersion for infusion containing 2 to 30 x 106 cells/ml of an 
autologous CD34+ cell-enriched population that contains haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a 
lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding ABCD1 cDNA for human adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) as 
active substance. The cells are suspended in Cryostor CS5 cryopreservation solution containing 5% 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The product is available in 20 ml fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) 
infusion bag(s), each packed in a transparent pouch inside a metal cassette. The composition is shown 
in Table 1. 
Table 1 Finished product composition 
 
One lot of finished product may be packaged in either one or two 20 mL bags, depending on the total 
number of cells present. Multiple lots may be administered to the patient as a single dose as 
documented in the Lot Information Sheet that accompanies the final product shipment. 
Adequate information on the excipient CryoStor CS5 is provided, including composition and 
specifications. CryoStor CS5 is released for production at the finished product manufacturing site based 
on visual inspection, inspection of the supplier Certificate of Analysis, and identity testing based on 
direct injection gas chromatography for determination of DMSO content. 
An overview of the manufacturing process development is provided. The finished product 
manufacturing process, consisting in formulation and cryopreservation, has remained unchanged 
during development and transferred to several manufacturing sites.  
Information on the selection of the container closure system is provided and is considered adequate. 
The selected container closure system supports product stability and is expected to be suitable for its 
intended use. The provided information on extractables is deemed sufficient. The applicant has 
provided a brief discussion of relevant aspects for microbiological safety, including testing of the 
finished product and the steam sterilised container. Container closure integrity was also tested after 
freezing, shipping and thawing of the bags and it met its specifications. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Batch release takes place at Minaris Regenerative Medicine GmbH., Ottobrunn, Germany (previously 
referred to as apceth). The active substance consists of the washed, transduced CD34+ enriched cells 
in a transfer pack. The active substance is centrifuged, formulated (i.e., resuspended) in

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 25/136 
 
cryopreservation solution and filled into bags to manufacture the finished product. There are no hold 
steps between active substance and finished product manufacture. 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of formulation and cryopreservation. Several 
process parameters were characterised to establish criticality, NORs and PARs. Based on data obtained 
in the characterisation of the manufacturing process relevant process parameter limits are established. 
Additional relevant parameters have been addressed.  
The labelling and traceability system is described, particularly the chain of identity. In general, the 
description is considered sufficient to ensure that the patient receives the correct product.  
Process validation 
As the manufacturing process for Skysona is performed in a continuous flow, the active substance and 
finished product process were qualified in the same PPQ runs. Sufficient information is provided 
demonstrating that for all investigated critical quality attributes, material is representative for the 
finished product. Based on additional analysis, indicating a statistical correlation between the proposed 
functional potency assay and the critical quality attributes currently included in the validation exercise, 
data provided are considered sufficient to support the conclusion that the manufacturing process is 
validated also with regards to %VLCFA reduction. 
Provided data indicate that LVV variability is probably not a major contributor to eli-cel variability and 
therefore the proposed approach is deemed acceptable.  
During the PPQ runs minor deviations were reported. These deviations are appropriately discussed and 
give no reason for concern.  
Results of IPCs, CPPs, non-CPPs and other operational parameters evaluated during process 
characterisation were provided for all steps included in the manufacturing process. In general, all 
acceptance criteria are met. All CPPs and non-CPPs where within their specified NORs with one 
exception which has been appropriately discussed and gives no reason for concern. 
The available batch analysis data for all quality attributes support the consistency of finished product 
manufacturing at the commercial site. 
Aseptic process simulation is performed regularly under conditions that are representative of actual 
manufacturing conditions. Results have been provided for three consecutive media fill simulations and 
gave satisfactory results without any contaminant units. Results for the media fill cover the maximum 
process time for manufacturing of finished product and demonstrates that aseptic conditions are 
maintained. 
Validation of the shipping system was performed. For performance qualification, mock product was 
shipped to locations representing the extremes of high temperature and distance. The approach is 
considered adequate. 
 
 
Product specification 
The proposed release specification includes tests for Potency, Identity, Purity, Strength, Safety and 
Quality.  
The proposed tests to control the finished product are acceptable. In general, the acceptance criteria 
for release are sufficiently justified and supported by batch analysis data.  
The strategy for release testing is described, including sampling points for tests performed on process 
intermediates, description of the matrices and justifications for each sampling point.

The testing panel is in general in line with expectations. The currently proposed acceptance criterion 
for the potency indicating attribute (% VLCFA reduction) is considered acceptable. However, this limit 
should be re-evaluated and, if needed, revised based on results obtained at release when a sufficient 
number of batches have been manufactured (See “Recommendations for future quality development”). 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the proposed potency assay (% 
VLCFA reduction assay), covering the lack of established specification limits, a request for further 
justifications to support the stability and validation data packages, a request for further data on the 
first step in the assay, and a request for data demonstrating the successful transfer of the potency 
assay to the batch release testing site. Additional data and justifications provided in response were 
considered acceptable and the major objection is considered resolved, with a recommendation to 
further review the acceptance criteria (discussed above) and to provide the final transfer validation 
report.  
In response to a major objection raised, the applicant has provided a risk evaluation concerning the 
presence of nitrosamine impurities. The risk assessment determined that there is no risk of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. The conclusion is endorsed, and thus the outcome of the 
nitrosamine risk evaluation is considered acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
An overview of the analytical procedures is provided. In general, the information is considered 
adequate. The methods are adequately described, and relevant validation data are provided for the 
non-compendial methods. Compendial methods have been appropriately verified. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data presented include the 46 batches manufactured for subjects with cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) treated in Studies ALD-102 and ALD-104. These include batches 
manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. 
Data support the consistency of the finished product manufactured at all sites.   
Reference materials 
A reference standard is not used in the testing and release of finished product. 
 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with current ICH/CHMP guidelines.  
Due to the autologous nature of the finished product and the limited number of patient cells, stability 
studies are performed on finished product manufactured from surrogate donor cells. This approach is 
considered acceptable. 
Long-term, accelerated and stress stability studies were conducted. Similar stability indicating 
attributes are addressed in all these studies. 
The strategy for (indirect) stability testing of the metabolic function is accepted, considering also that 
the limited amount of material produced for each batch is normally used entirely for treatment of the 
patient. 
Long term stability data are available for several batches including PPQ batches and batches 
manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing site. In general, results comply with the 
specifications.  
Overall, the available data support the proposed shelf life of 6 months at ≤-140°C.  
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 27/136 
 
Accelerated stability studies performed are completed. Stability attributes remain within respective 
protocol specification throughout the test periods. No apparent trends were observed. 
Stability of batches at 18-25°C was studied and provided data support the proposed post-thaw infusion 
time of 4 hours. 
For the freeze/thaw studies performed on PPQ batches, diluted cryopreserved finished product was 
removed from the cryopreservation unit, stored and refrozen. Stability attributes for these samples 
remained within specification limits and similar data were observed, as compared to control (not 
thawed) cryovials. 
In conclusion, the available data support the proposed shelf life of 6 months at ≤-140°C and the 
proposed handling/administration procedures as outlined in the SmPC.  
Adventitious agents 
The applicant has provided a general overview of the adventitious agents safety evaluation, including 
information on the control of materials, control of the manufacturing environment, and the testing for 
potential adventitious agents.  
Non-viral adventitious agents 
The information provided on the control of non-viral adventitious agents is considered sufficient.  
An overview table is provided of the testing performed for mycoplasma, sterility, bioburden, and 
endotoxin at the various stages of the manufacturing process. Animal derived materials are discussed 
with regard to the risk for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Bovine derived materials 
are sourced from animals in the US, Canada, or New Zealand. TSE certificates of suitability have been 
provided. The risk for TSE is considered negligible. 
Viral adventitious agents 
Virus safety is built on adequate control of starting materials and raw materials as no steps capable of 
inactivating or removing viruses are included in the manufacturing process.  
An overview of the adventitious agent testing at various stages of the manufacturing process and at 
final batch release for starting materials and finished product has been provided. 
Donors are tested for infectious agents listed in the EU Cell and Tissue Directive. Summaries are 
provided on the origin of plasmids and cell banks, as well as an overview of the cell bank (MCB, WCB, 
EOPC) testing results and method summaries of the tests used for cell bank qualification.  
For all materials of human or animal origin assessments of the risk for adventitious virus transmission 
are performed.  
In general, the information on human- and animal-derived materials is in line with relevant guidelines 
and directives and is evaluated to sufficiently mitigate the risk of adventitious agents’ contamination. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Two major objections were raised during the procedure. One related to the potency assay and covered 
the lack of established specification limits, a request for further justifications to support the stability

Page 28/136 
 
and validation data packages, a request for further data on the first step in the assay, and a request 
for data demonstrating the successful transfer of the potency assay to the batch release testing site. 
The second major objection related to the absence of a risk evaluation concerning the presence of 
potential nitrosamine impurities. In response, the applicant submitted additional data and justifications 
and the major objections are now considered satisfactorily resolved. 
At the time of the CAT/CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having 
no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to review of in-process/specification 
limits based on further manufacturing experience, provision of the final transfer validation reports for 
the potency assay, further process characterisation, and confirmation of contractual agreements 
between the raw material suppliers and the finished product manufacturer. These points are put 
forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality development.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CAT/CHMP recommends points for investigation, pertaining to review of in-process/specification 
limits based on further manufacturing experience, provision of the final transfer validation reports for 
the potency assay, further process characterisation, and confirmation of contractual agreements 
between the raw material suppliers and the finished product manufacturer. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the recommendations for future quality 
development. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Mechanism of action 
The Lenti-D LVV drug product, Skysona, is a cell dispersion for infusion. Its active substance consists 
of an autologous peripheral blood (mPB)-derived CD34+ cell-enriched population from patients with 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) that contains CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) 
transduced ex vivo with the Lenti-D lentiviral vector (LVV) that encodes for the human ATP binding 
cassette (ABC), subfamily D, member 1 (ABCD1) transgene (cDNA) and expresses human 
adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). Thus, the Lenti-D LVV is not administered to patients; it is used 
to transduce the patients’ own autologous HSCs ex vivo during the manufacture of the drug substance. 
Skysona is intended for autologous use only, as a single IV infusion of 2-30 × 106 CD34+ cells/mL 
dispersion for infusion,(the minimum recommended dose of Skysona is 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg) to 
treat patients less than 18 years of age with early CALD for whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-
matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not available.  
CALD is an X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by a mutation in the ALDP-encoding ABCD1 
gene. ALDP is responsible for transportation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA)s and VLCFA-CoA 
into the peroxisome, where VLCFAs are broken down.  In the absence of functional ALDP, VLCFAs

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 29/136 
 
accumulates in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected cells and/or tissues are those 
that specialize in fatty acid metabolism: myelinated cells in the white matter of the CNS, adrenocortical 
cells in the adrenal glands, and interstitial (Leydig) cells within the testes. A prominent manifestation 
of CALD is the accumulation of VLCFAs in tissues that is associated with progressive demyelination and 
cerebral inflammation within the brain, which, if untreated, leads to severe loss of neurological function 
over time, and death. One of the hallmarks of inflammatory disease in CALD is the presence of a 
compromised BBB behind the leading edge of demyelinating lesions. The compromised BBB is 
suggested by the applicant to facilitate distribution of the product to the brain, i.e. migration of cells 
deriving from the autologous transplanted transduced CD34+ mPB HSC across the BBB. ALDP 
deficiency results in highly heterogeneous disease presentation among subjects and there is limited 
correlation between genotype (mutation) and phenotype (disease manifestation). 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
For Lenti-D Drug Product, the primary pharmacodynamic effect was defined as the production of 
transgenic ALDP, which was represented by the proportion of ALDP-positive (%ALDP+) cells. The 
secondary pharmacodynamic effect was defined as improving or correcting very long chain fatty acid 
(VLCFA) metabolism.  
Due to difficulties in obtaining the cell population on which the clinical therapy is based on (i.e. CD34+ 
mPB HSC from CALD patients), the pharmacodynamic studies have been carried out with the use of 
various surrogate cell populations, as CD34+ mPB HSC from healthy donors, ALDP-defect fibroblasts 
(FB)s from ALD patients and ALDP-defect CD34+ mPB HSC from AMN patients. In scientific advice 
received from the CHMP, the surrogate cell strategy was accepted in general terms. 
 
From the comparison of lentiviral vectors expressing the ABCD1 gene from various promoters the 
internal MNDU3 promoter was selected for use in Lenti-D LVV, as it was the most efficient transducer 
of ALD FBs and human healthy donor mPB CD34+ HSCs, as compared to Lenti-D LVVs with internal 
EFs or PGK promoters. Lenti-D LVV (MNDU3), was also the most efficient promotor for expressing 
ALDP in ALD donor FBs and healthy human mPB-derived CD34+ HSCs. Moreover, there was a direct 
relationship between MOI and VCN values and %ALDP+ cells after Lenti-D LVV transduction of human 
ALDP-deficient FBs with MOI ranging from 0.3 – 5.5. 
Transduction of 6 different lots of healthy donor mPB-derived CD34+ cells with Lenti-D LVV (MOI = 
90% LVV supernatant) resulted in consistent and comparable results, with minimal (<2-fold) 
variability, for VCN values and %ALDP+ cells in 7-day liquid or 14-day methylcellulose cultures. A 
trend for lower colony counts in transduced, as compared to mock-transduced. Lenti-D LVV 
transduction of ALDP deficient human AMN donor mPB-derived CD34+ cells at increasing MOIs, also 
resulted in VCN values, %ALDP+ cells and improvements in VLCFA metabolism that were directly 
related to MOI. VLCFA metabolism was corrected at higher MOIs (≥29; ≥40% LVV supernatant). Also, 
for the ALDP deficient human AMN donor mPB-derived CD34+ cells, the highest MOI (58; 80% LVV 
supernatant) was associated with lower colony counts. 
Transduction with Lenti-D LVV of Human AMN and healthy donor mPB-derived CD34+ cells conducted 
by two different operators was validated with generally similar outcome. In addition, and in agreement 
with the other studies, transduction at higher MOI (in this study, values ≥44) provided only modest 
increases in VCN values and %ALDP+ cells. The colony counts also appeared to be lower at MOIs ≥44. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
There are no animal models of CALD that recapitulate the human disease and could be used for 
demonstration of improvements in cerebral inflammation and demyelination. For this reason, an in 
vitro bridging strategy was applied by demonstrating preclinical POC for Lenti-D LVV-mediated 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 30/136 
 
correction of VLCFA metabolism using cultured ALD FBs and AMN CD34+ HSCs. In vivo, preclinical POC 
for brain engraftment of Lenti-D transduced CD34+ HSCs was evaluated in myeloablated 
immunodeficient mice in pivotal combined in vivo pharmacology, single-dose toxicity, genotoxicity and 
biodistribution studies in immunodeficient (NSG and NSGS) mice. 
Bone marrow (BM) engraftment and chimerism were displayed in myeloablated NSG mice, at Month 1 
and Month 3 after they had received mock- or Lenti-D LVV-transduced human healthy donor mPB-
derived CD34+ HSCs. Similar results were obtained after Lenti-D LVV- as well as mock-transduction. A 
trend towards higher engraftment in female mice was noted. In the subsequent study, only female 
mice were used. In addition, there was a reduction in engrafted hCD45+ BM cells from Month 1 to 
Month 3 of 11 or 34 % in Lenti-D LVV or mock-transduced female mice, respectively. A similar 
reduction in VCN values, by 29%, from Month 1 to Month 3 was also reported. 
Migration to the brain of human-origin haematopoiesis-derived cells (i.e., hCD45+ leukocytes), with a 
human microglial cell immunophenotype (hIba-1+) and expressing a human microglial cell protein 
(hFGFR-1+) was demonstrated to occur in myeloablated NSGS mice, subsequently to BM engraftment 
of transplanted Lenti-D LVV- or mock-transduced human healthy donor mPB-derived CD34+ HSCs. No 
such migration of human cells could be demonstrated in NSG mice. In the transplanted NSGS mice, it 
was not possible for the applicant to demonstrate specific staining of hALDP+ cells within the brain, 
although migration of human CD45+ cells with microglial phenotype was demonstrated. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary pharmacology studies have been carried out. There was no indication of any safety 
related findings potentially related to secondary pharmacology in the toxicology part. 
Safety pharmacology 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been carried out. No overt toxicity in CNS, 
cardiovascular or respiratory system related to administration of Lenti-D LVV has been observed in the 
two animal studies. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional PK studies were not conducted as Lenti-D Drug Product is an autologous human cell-
based product. The biodistribution of human Lenti-D LVV transduced CD34+ HSCs from healthy donors 
were investigated in two different strains of immune-deficient mice (NSG and NSGS). Cellular 
transduction with Lenti-D LVV is performed ex vivo and no free viral vector should be present in final 
Drug Product. 
It should be noted that the difficulties for mimicking human engraftment in non-clinical studies are 
acknowledged and due to the species barrier and other factors, the biodistribution results from 
immune-incompetent mice are most likely not fully translatable for how the cells distribute and persist 
in humans. 
The methods of analysis were not validated. However, they are overall considered to have been 
conducted with sufficiently high scientific standards and the results are not questioned. 
The PK and biodistribution of Lenti-D LVV transduced human CD34+ cells were evaluated in two 
combined pharmacology, biodistribution and toxicology studies, both in immune-incompetent mice 
(NSG and NSGS). Both studies used IV injection (clinical route) and busulfan pre-conditioning (used 
clinically) and investigated biodistribution parameters of mock (no LVV) or Lenti-D LVV transduced 
CD34+ human cells following a single IV injection. Both studies used a single dose of 40×106 cells/kg, 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 31/136 
 
which according to the applicant was the maximal feasible dose based on the number of cells available 
and cell concentration/allowable dose volumes. The dose represents an 8-fold multiple of the minimum 
dose of Lenti-D Drug Product for patients with CALD (≥5×106 CD34+ cells/kg). The VCN were within 
the clinical range. 
IV administration of Lenti-D LVV-transduced human autologous CD34+ HSCs to myeloablated patients 
with CALD is hypothesised to result in initial distribution to most tissues via the circulatory system. 
Indeed PCR analysis detected human DNA sequences (Hu-hck1) and Lenti-D viral DNA sequences (Psi-
gag) in all tissues tested (bone-marrow, brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, ovaries, skeletal 
muscle, spleen and testes) which remained throughout the 3-month study period. For human 
sequences (Hu-hck1) and Lenti-D viral sequences (Psi-gag), the highest concentration (copies/µg) was 
observed in bone-marrow were signals above the upper LoQ were observed. Medium to high 
concentrations were observed in lung, liver and spleen whereas medium concentrations were detected 
in heart and kidney. Lower concentrations were seen in brain, intestine and muscle. 
Following engraftment in bone-marrow, the cells are believed to differentiate further into various cell 
types. Also, some HSCs are thought to be able to engraft directly with certain tissues such as the 
brain. The hypothesised mode of action of Lenti-D Drug Product requires transduced HSCs to 
differentiate into microglia-like cells expressing ALDP and engraft and persist within the brain.  Studies 
on the distribution of the transduced cells to the brain are therefore regarded key for supporting the 
proposed mechanism of action. The biodistribution data in immune-incompetent mice are considered to 
support Lenti-D LVV transduced CD34+ HSC engraftment and persistence in bone-marrow and the 
brain. It should however be noted that human DNA signals in brain were very low and ALDP production 
in brain could not be demonstrated. 
Overall, these results could lend support to the notion that Lenti-D Drug Product can distribute to brain 
and persist as microglia-like cells in CALD patients. 
Germ line transmission studies 
No dedicated germline transmission studies have been conducted. Given that the cells are transduced 
ex vivo with a replication-incompetent vector and no residual free viral particles are present in the 
Lenti-D Drug Product, the risk for germ line transmission is considered regarded very limited and 
rather theoretical. Also, patients will be preconditioned with the reprotoxic busulfan, often resulting in 
infertility. The omission of specific germ line transmission studies is therefore acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety programme conducted with Lenti-D LVV transduced human CD34+ HCSs 
consists of two single-dose toxicology studies performed in NSG and NSGS immune-incompetent mice.  
Since Lenti-D LVV will integrate in the genome, the potential for insertional site mutagenesis to induce 
transformative changes was investigated in murine lineage-negative (Lin-) bone marrow cells (BMCs). 
Furthermore Lenti-D LVV integration patterns in healthy human CD34+ cells were analysed by 
integration site analysis (ISA). 
No repeat-dose toxicology, dedicated carcinogenicity, juvenile or developmental and reproductive 
toxicology studies were performed, and their omission is acceptable considering the nature of the

Relevance of animal models 
Lenti-D LVV is a single-dose autologous cell therapy. If human cells are administered to immune-
competent animals, they will be rejected. Therefore immune-incompetent mice strains were used. 
Since mice (including immune-incompetent mice) do not provide optimal physiological conditions for

promoting survival and function of human cells, the relevance of the non-clinical in vivo model, in 
particular for predicting risk of toxicity and cancer development in humans, is considered limited.  NSG 
mice lack mature T or B cells, functional NK cells, and cytokine signaling and predominately promote 
development of lymphoid cells. NSGS mice, in comparison to NSG mice, also express human cytokines 
(IL-3, GM-CSF and SF) promoting differentiation of myeloid cells. Although the value of using immune-
incompetent mice to predict safety issues for a human cell therapy is questionable, the strains have 
been used as a model for HSC engraftment and their use can from that point be justified.  
Single-dose toxicity 
The toxicity of Lenti-D LVV transduced human CD34+ cells were evaluated in two separate single-dose 
studies, both in immune-incompetent mice. One study was GLP compliant and used NSG mice and the 
other study was an investigative study and used both NSG and NSGS mice that received busulfan to 
induce myeloablation and facilitate HSC engraftment in bone marrow.  
In the GLP study (NC-12-007), cells were well-tolerated in NSG mice over the 3-months study period. 
Comparable engraftment of cells was seen in mock and Lenti-D LVV transduced cells. The toxic effects 
of busulfan makes it difficult to pinpoint Lenti-D LVV-related toxicity. That given, there were no Lenti-D 
LVV-related adverse effects on clinical signs, body weights or clinical pathology parameters. A NOAEL 
of 40×106 cells/kg (8X margin) is therefore acceptable. 
In the investigative study B1-13-003 using both NSG and NSGS mice, the only toxicological 
parameters investigated were clinical signs, body weights, haematology, serum chemistry (only 
phosphorous) and organ weights (brain and tibias only). All animals survived throughout the study but 
from week 10, cells (both mock and Lenti D cells) were not well-tolerated by NSGS mice and signs of 
myeloid-driven bone-marrow dysfunction were present (weight loss, abnormal clinical signs, decreased 
platelets, immature blood cells). This was most likely due to the transgenic expression of human 
myelosupportive cytokines (IL-3, GM-CSF and SF) in NSGS mice that promotes a biased engraftment 
and differentiation of myeloid cells and leading to myeloid-driven bone marrow dysfunction.   
Again, the Lenti-D LVV transduced cells were overall well-tolerated by NSG mice. Similar to the results 
from the GLP-study there were no clinical observations. A decrease in body weight change (-30%, 0-3 
months) and a slight decrease in body weight was observed in animals receiving Lenti-D LVV 
transduced cells. The decrease was more pronounced between week 10 and 13 (-52,9%). Platelet 
counts were decreased in Lenti-D treated animals (-51%). The relevance of the weight and platelet 
findings are unclear since no clear body weight effects or decreased platelets were seen in the GLP 
study.

Repeat-dose toxicity 
As Lenti-D Drug Product is intended for a single autologous IV administration, not performing any 
repeat-dose toxicity studies is acceptable. 
Genotoxicity 
Lenti-D is an autologous human cellular product, therefore, standard genotoxicity studies are not 
considered relevant. Since Lenti-D LVV will integrate in the genome, the primary safety concern for 
Lenti-D Drug Product is the risk that it may be associated with an oncogenic event resulting from 
insertional mutagenesis. The applicant has performed an in vitro immortalisation (IVIM) study 
performed in Lenti-D LVV-transduced mouse lineage-depleted (Lin-) BMCs.  Moreover, the integration 
patterns in human healthy donor CD34+ HSCs, pre and post transplantation into mice, were 
characterised by integration site analysis (ISA). 
In vitro immortalisation (IVIM) study:  Although the IVIM assay is routinely used and may provide 
some information on possible gene deregulations, it should be noted that comes with several 
limitations with the most obvious being that it is performed in murine cells and non-clinical integration 
studies are largely not predictive for the integration in treated patients. 
Overall, the IVIM results indicate that Lenti-D LVV has a significant reduced risk of in vitro 
immortalisation of murine BMCs compared to positive control vectors.  
For the IVIM assay, the BMCs were transduced with Lenti-D LVV. Two weeks after limited dilution 
plating in 96- plates, wells were evaluated microscopically and metabolically (MTT assay) for an 
immortalised or transformed phenotype. A fitness score (FS) was calculated by normalising the 
replating frequency (RF) to VCN values. The IVIM assay included positive control vectors RSF91 
(gamma- retroviral vector) and lv-SF (lentiviral vector) previously demonstrated to induce 
immortalisation. Mean VCN values for Lenti-D LVV cells were 4,78 c/dg (6,06; 6,11; 2,1) which, in two 
of three experiments, were above the highest VCN used in the clinical studies (3,1).   
Data of three independent IVIM assays indicated normal cell proliferation for Lenti-D LVV and the 
positive control vectors when compared to mock transduced cells (no viral vector). 
Evidence of in vitro genotoxicity was observed in the positive controls RSF91 (gamma retroviral vector) 
and Iv-SF (Lentiviral vector) confirming the sensitivity of the assay. Lenti-D LVV cells had a low fitness 
score (×10-4) of ~0.1. However, the MTT assay was positive in 33% for Lenti-D LVV compared to 98-
100% in the positive controls. Moreover, Lenti-D LVV cells where negative microscopically in two 
experiments but one experiment showed weak proliferating colony growth in two wells. It is not clear if 
this clone could be further expanded. Only one single Lot of Lenti-D LVV was tested in the IVIM assay. 
Optimally, several lots should be tested since the fitness score can vary between IVIM assays and 
vector lots. 
Integration site analysis (ISA): Insertional mutagenesis that could promote oncogenesis is considered 
a primary safety concern.  Lenti-D LVV integration patterns were studied in human CD34+ cells (from 
healthy donors) pre-transplant (in vitro) and post-transplant (in vivo, BMCs from myeloablated 
immunodeficient NSG mice from the NC-12-007 GLP study) by integration site analysis (ISA). LAM-PCR 
in combination with gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing was used to determine the integration 
pattern and data were compared to a random data set of 4742 insertional sites (IS).   
Overall, the results are consistent with previously described LVV integration profiles with preferred 
integration in gene-coding regions across the whole genome with no preference for integration in 
transcriptional start sites and no bias for the 5´or 3´end of genes. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 34/136 
 
Gel electrophoresis images of LAM-PCR amplicons indicated that pre-transplant (in vitro) transduced 
cells had a polyclonal pattern whereas an oligoclonal/polyclonal pattern was seen in post-transplant (in 
vivo) BMCs collected after 1- or 3-months. No obvious difference in clonal size of BMCs harvested at 30 
days and 90 days was detected, indicating that no clonal selection occurred in vivo. 
The chromosomal distribution of all IS appeared to be close to random but a preference for integration 
on chromosomes 17 and 19 was observed.  An enrichment of IS was seen within gene coding regions 
compared to regulatory elements with the overall frequency of IS within gene-coding regions of ~70%. 
This observed pattern with insertions in genes is believed to decrease the risk of an insertion leading to 
a disruptive gene regulation promoting transformation. 
Genes targeted by the vector were analysed in more detail. 1448 genes (out of 21374 in total) were 
identified as targets for Lenti-D LVV integration. Out of these, 151 targets were annotated as 
transcription regulators. Integration hotspots were investigated by determining the occurrence of 
common integration sites (CIS). CIS are regions in which multiple vector integration occurs and are 
thought to be an indicator for possible clonal selection. Approximately 19 % av all IS were found to be 
CIS and the applicant has provided information on the genes targeted. To conclude, the ISA results 
suggest an insertion preference consistent with other LVV described in the literature. There were no 
signs of clonal selection and the overall potential for genotoxicity is considered sufficiently low. It 
should however be noted that predominant clones have been reported in two human patients receiving 
Lenti-D. 
Carcinogenicity 
No traditional life-time rodent carcinogenicity studies were performed, which is acceptable. However, 
the applicant points out that no signs of tumorigenicity was observed in any of the non-clinical studies. 
This is not considered predictive for humans.   
2.3.4.  Environmental risk assessment 
Skysona contains a Lenti-D lentiviral vector that is replication defective, self-inactivating. The lentiviral 
vector is used for the ex-vivo transduction (genetic modification) of autologous human CD34+ cells. 
The transduced cells express ALDP. 
Lenti-D Drug Product is a genetically modified organism (GMO) product and is a such assessed through 
a GMO environmental risk procedure approach. Skysona is not intended for deliberate release into the 
environment and cannot survive if accidentally released into the environment. The predicted behaviour 
of Skysona and the environmental impact of the product is not considered to be different from the non-
modified CALD CD34+ HSCs. As such, shedding of modified cells via e.g. the blood is unlikely to be an 
issue. The risk to the environment in therefore considered negligible. 
Another shedding possibility is if there are residual lentiviral vectors (LVV) in the product, but the 
quality strategy by the applicant supports the notion that the presence of such LVVs is negligible.  
Overall, the risk to the environment, human or animal health of shedding of viral particles is negligible. 
In terms of risks for non-patients, this mainly leaves accidental transferal to non-target persons (e.g. 
via accidental transfer healthcare professionals or patients, via transfusion of blood or transplantation 
of cells, tissues or organs from a donor that has been treated with Skysona). A risk for non-human 
organisms is considered negligible. Among those ‘accidental’ transmission to non-target person 
scenarios, Nominally, Skysona (modified CALD CD34+ HSCs) would have no different human health 
effects than the recipient (non-transduced) CALD CD34+ HSCs. Yet associated with such an accidental 
event (especially in immunodeficient persons) is that any residual LVVs may initiate insertional 
mutagenesis that may lead to oncogenesis (considered a theoretical possibility for Skysona patients).

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 35/136 
 
The replication-defective nature of the LVV prevents the possibility of spontaneous mobilisation of the 
integrated vector from the transduced cells unless helper functions are provided in the transduced cells 
by super-infection with wild-type virus (e.g. HIV or HTLV) in an infected host. The self-inactivating 
feature (SIN) of the vector LTR inhibits vector mobilisation even in the case of superinfection of the 
transduced cell by a wildtype virus. There are also risk minimisation procedures such as viral screening 
in putative patients/donors, making the overall risk for this hazard negligible in non-target persons. 
Therefore, Skysona is predicted to have overall negligible environmental impact.  
Adequate measures are implemented in the product information to prevent risks of accidental transfer 
during administration to health care professionals involved in the handling/administering the product. 
Adequate measures are also put in place for storage, transportation and waste treatment. Patients are 
also asked to refrain from donating blood/cells/tissues/organs after being administered Skysona. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
There was a direct relationship between MOI and VCN values and %ALDP+ cells after Lenti-D LVV 
transduction of human ALDP-deficient FBs with MOI ranging from 0.3 – 5.5 (study NC-12-003). I is 
noted the % ALDP+ cells in in vitro cultured ALD donor FBs appear to be slowly diminishing over the 
limited time studied (up to three weeks). A reduction in % ALDP+ cells was also observed in clinical 
trials at early time points after treatment, but the level was stabilised at 6 months after treatment and 
remained stable at 24 moths and at latest studied time point, 60 months after treatment. 
A trend for lower colony counts in transduced, as compared to mock-transduced cells suggested a 
possible effect by the Lenti-D LVV transduction on cellular growth and proliferation. However, the 
applicant put forward that in an in vitro immortalisation (IVIM) study, transduction of mouse BMCs 
with Lenti-D LVV at MOI 120 resulted in a VCN value of 4.78 c/dg and was not associated with 
cytotoxic effects. Nevertheless, in several of the other performed studies the colony counts appeared 
lower at higher MOIs. The applicant has provided clarification on this issue and it is likely that the 
initial reduction of engrafting cells is not a result of cytotxicity due to high MOIs. It is also noted that 
the MOIs used in the in vitro nonclinical studies were substantially higher than are used in the 
manufacture of Lenti-D Drug Product, which supports the safety of the clinical product.  
In the transplanted NSGS mice, it was not possible for the applicant to demonstrate specific staining of 
hALDP+ cells within the brain, although migration to the brain of human CD45+ cells with microglial 
phenotype was demonstrated. The applicant provides two potential explanations for this. First, a 
substantial non-specific staining was observed in the mouse brains. Furthermore, the absence of 
specific hALDP staining in mouse brains is not inconsistent with the relative absence of hALDP+ cells in 
normal human brain. These potential explanations could be acceptable. Considering the relatively 
modest  increase in fluorescens signal (33%) after ALDP -staining of hCD45+/hALDP+ BM cells in the 
NSGS mice transplanted with Lenti-D LVV compared to mock-transduced human healthy donor (ALDP 
wild type) mPB-derived CD34+ HSCs, ALDP-brightly stained cells above background was perhaps not 
to be expected. The “background” normal tissue expression of ALDP in wildtype mouse and human 
tissues has been demonstrated to be comparable (Fouquet et al. 1997). 
In summary, BM and brain engraftment by Lenti-D LVV (and mock-) transduced human mPB CD34+ 
cells have been demonstrated in the immune compromised NSGS mouse model. It is unclear why no 
ALDP+ cells could be identified in the brain after infusion with the Lenti-D LVV transduced cells, 
although >24% of the CD34+ cells were shown to be ALDP+ before infusion and thus a fifth of the 
counted CD34+ cells theoretically could be ALDP+. The clinical situation can, however, not be expected 
to be fully represented due to the translational gap between this mouse model and patients. Thus, the

Skysona - Assessment report

Page 36/136 
 
study can be considered acceptable as a nonclinical proof of principle, that Lenti-D LVV transduced 
human mPB CD34+ cells can engraft the BM and also migrate to the brain and there show microglial 
phenotypic markers. 
Demonstration of  Lenti-D LVV-mediated correction of VLCFA metabolism in vitro, using ALD FBs and 
AMN CD34+ HSCs, was suggested by the applicant to constitute a preclinical PoC since there are no 
animal models of CALD that recapitulate the human disease and could be used for demonstration of 
improvements in cerebral inflammation and demyelination after administration of Lenti-D-transduced 
CD34+ HSCs. However, in the assessment this is not considered as a regular PoC. Nevertheless, taken 
together with the indicated brain engraftment, these both observations provide acceptable preclinical 
support for the treatment concept. The translational gap between the xenotransplantation model with 
transduced human cells infused to immunocompromised mice as compared to patients, precludes 
addressing more detailed clinical questions since that would require, among other things, an optimal 
environment for the differentiation and migration of human HSCs, which so far has not been possible 
to establish in an animal model.  
No secondary pharmacological studies have been carried out. The autologous components of the 
Skysona product is not expected to exert any off-target effects within the physiological range. 
However, off-target effects cannot be excluded at overexpressed levels or possibly at non physiological 
distribution. The applicants definition of secondary pharmacodynamics appears to parallel the primary 
pharmacodynamic effect. However, there were no indication of any safety related findings potentially 
related to secondary pharmacology in the toxicology part. Considering the class and nature of this 
autologous cell drug product, the absence of dedicated secondary pharmacodynamic studies is 
accepted. 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies have been conducted. In addition, to the absence of overt 
safety pharmacology findings in the animal studies, there is no indications of any findings potentially 
related to safety pharmacology in the clinical studies, though it should be considered the patients 
undergo a conditioning treatment possibly masking potential safety related findings. Considering the 
class and nature of this autologous cell drug product, the absence of dedicated safety pharmacology 
studies is accepted. 
Toxicology 
The applicant considers the finding of a HMGA2 insertion in one mouse to be of little or no relevance to 
the oncogenic potential of Lenti-D and has provided a discussion on IS in the HMGA2 gene. The 
relevance of the mouse observation is considered unknown by the applicant since the effect on 
oncogenicity is dependent on the exact position of the insertion. This is acknowledged. It should 
however be noted that two human subjects receiving Lenti-D have emerged with predominant clones, 
so far without clinical consequences. In both cases the clone appears to be of myeloid lineage and both 
subjects had an IS in the MECOM gene. This is further discussed in the clinical part. 
Although the samples in the ISA were within the range VCN used in clinical trials (0,5-3,1), none of the 
samples had VCN values equal to or above the highest VCN used clinically (3,1) This is not optimal 
since increasing VCN levels are expected to lead to an increase in the number of insertions. Also, the 
cells used in the ISA appear to be from a single donor and transduced with a single Lot (batch) of 
Lenti-D LVV.  However, these shortcomings are not considered enough for demanding additional 
analysis and could be considered covered by the clinical monitoring, were subjects in the clinical 
studies are monitored by ISA every 6 months up to 5 years after treatment and patients are to be 
monitored annually for leukemia/lymphoma for 15 years post treatment. 
Environmental risk assessment

Page 37/136 
 
Skysona is not intended for deliberate release into the environment and cannot survive if accidentally 
released into the environment. As such, shedding of modified cells via e.g. the blood is unlikely to be 
an issue. Another shedding possibility is if there are residual lentiviral vectors (LVV) in the product, but 
the quality strategy by the applicant supports the notion that the presence of such LVVs is negligible. 
In terms of risks, this mainly leaves accidental transferal to non-target persons (e.g. via accidental 
transfer healthcare professionals, via transfusion of blood or transplantation of cells, tissues or organs 
from a donor that has been treated with eli-cel). Considering the risk management scenarios, the 
vector itself (e.g. SIN properties) and the required conditions in the nonpatient for a possible effect 
(e.g. immunodeficient,), eli-cel is predicted to have overall negligible environmental impact. It can be 
noted since the modified CALD cells cannot survive in the environment outside the human body, no 
methods of detection have been developed for the purpose of environmental monitoring. But eli-cel 
could be still detected by adequate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods that have been designed 
to amplify a portion of the integrated cDNA (psi-gag) or by sequencing cellular gDNA (see Quality 
aspects) – e.g. in the case of accidental transmission to third parties.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.  
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
As Skysona is an autologous cell-based gene therapy product, conventional non-clinical studies might 
not always be relevant. Overall, the pharmacological studies provide evidence that support efficacy in 
humans. The safety data from immune-deficient mice are considered less relevant in predicting the 
human situation. When it comes to cell therapies, it is well established that animal models are poor 
predictors of safety in humans. Therefore, the persistence and safety of Skysona can eventually only 
be determined by clinical use. When it comes to genetic safety, the integration pattern of skysona is 
considered to, overall, be consistent with previously described LVV integration profiles with preferred 
integration in gene-coding regions across the whole genome. It is however noted that two human 
subjects receiving Skysona have emerged with predominant clones, so far without clinical 
consequences. In both cases the clone appears to be of myeloid lineage and both subjects had an IS in 
the MECOM gene. This is further discussed in the clinical part. Skysona is predicted to have overall 
negligible environmental impact and adequate precautions are included in the product information for 
handling, disposal or accidental exposure. 
From a non-clinical perspective, the MAA for Skysona can be approvable, if the B/R is considered 
positive for quality and clinical side.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Elivaldogene autotemcel (eli-cel) is a gene therapy medicinal product intended for the treatment of 
cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). The active substance is an autologous CD34+ cell-enriched

population that contains haematopoietic stem cells transduced with a lentiviral vector (LVV) encoding 
ABCD1 cDNA for human adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP).  
Skysona is presented as a dispersion for infusion; cells are suspended in Cryostore CS5 
cryopreservation solution containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Eli-cel is supplied in 20 ml 
fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags and is administered as a single dose by intravenous 
infusion. Each lot contains between 40 x 106 and 1200 x 106 cells. 
The pharmacokinetics of the vector – in terms of vector copy number (VCN) - and transgene product 
were studied in studies ALD-102, 104 and their follow-up LTF-304. A number of analytical methods 
were used for this purpose. The VCN and ALDP data is presented in the pharmacodynamics section 
below.  
Each analytical method was available in two versions, unless noted otherwise. The following methods 
were used to monitor subjects after treatment with eli-cel for the presence of transgene sequences, 
transgene expression, and replication competent vector, as well as to identify the genomic integration 
sites present in clinical samples:

Cell-sorting method 
This method aimed at separating blood cells into T cells (CD3+), monocytes (CD14+), neutrophils 
(CD15+) and B-cells (CD19+) for use in downstream applications such as VCN determination, ALDP+ 
determination and integration site analysis (ISA). The procedure uses commercially available magnetic 
microbead-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, which recognize and bind to specific molecules on the 
surface of the cells of interest. When the sample is subjected to a magnetic field, the cells of interest, 
bound to the magnetic beads, can be separated using positive selection, where they remain in 
suspension to collect the cell populations of interest. All cell subtypes were separated with average 
purities of at least 87% at CCHMC, while purity was slightly lower at PPD (62-91% depending on cell 
type).  
HIV qPCR

This qPCR assay was used to quantify vector copy numbers in transduced cells. Because the vector 
copy number (VCN) is determined on a heterogeneous population of cells, VCN is a composite value, 
dependent both on percent of cells transduced (percent of cells LVV-positive, %LVV+) as well as 
number of copies per transduced cell. VCN measured in drug product, which is comprised largely of 
CD34+ cells, is referred to as DP VCN; VCN measured in peripheral blood leukocytes is referred to as 
PB VCN; and VCN measured in CD14+ monocytes is referred to as CD14+ VCN.  
Two closely related qPCR methods for the detection of HIV-1 sequences in human genomic DNA 
(gDNA) and quantification of VCN values within cell samples were validated using the K3 cell line as a 
control. It is a diploid human-derived cell line, so that the target gene and the internal reference genes 
exist in a 1:1 ratio. The main difference between the method at CCHMC and PPD was the reference 
gene. A plasmid containing psi-gag and the reference gene was used for quantitation.  
Flow Cytometry Method for Detection of ALDP+ Cells in Peripheral Blood 
Relative to CALD HSCs with a mutated ABCD1 gene, the transduced CALD HSCs and their progeny will 
over-express ALDP when analysed by flow cytometry, allowing for a calculation of the relative numbers 
of ALDP+ cells, defined as the percentage of cells that stained above background (i.e., above 
endogenous ALDP levels in non-transduced cells) in drug product, peripheral blood or CD14+ cells. 
For intracellular staining of ALDP, fresh (up to 96h after collection) cells are permeabilised with a 
detergent or alcohol to allow antibodies against intracellular antigens to enter the cell, followed by 
indirect staining, where ALDP is reacted with an unlabelled primary antibody, followed by a 
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody specific for the primary antibody.  
Both CCHMC and PPD methods used peripheral blood monocytes, which serve as a surrogate marker 
for HSCs and their progeny. Both methods were qualified using whole blood from healthy donors as 
negative control and CD34+ cells transduced with Lenti-D LVV as positive control. 
At CCHMC, the assay can consistently detect down to 1.5 % ALDP+ cells with a precision of 72-106% 
and can reliably quantify ~ 4% ALDP positive cells – considering occasional outliers.  
At PPD, the LLOQ was determined to be 3% ALDP+ cells. Additionally, simultaneous staining with an 
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 IgG2a antibody CD14 enabled gating of CD14+ 
cells without using magnetic bead separation first. Samples from healthy donors give a baseline of < 
1% ALDP+ cells. Similarly, CALD patients prior to eli-cel administration also have non detectable or < 
1% ALDP+ cells. 
Screening and confirmation of replication competent lentivirus (RCL) 
Two methods for RCL were used to screen blood samples from subjects who had received eli-cel: an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and a qPCR assay. 
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method utilising a commercially available kit for the 
detection of HIV-1 protein in human plasma or serum was qualified. The HIV-1 method was found to 
lack sensitivity and result in repeated false positive results due to interferences. The qPCR method was 
therefore used instead. In study ALD-102, all samples from subjects’ certain subjects, and samples at 
month 3, 6 and 12 of other subjects were analysed only with the ELISA assay. All results from these 
subjects were negative.  
A qPCR assay for the detection of in DNA from human blood was adopted as a method to screen for 
RCL. The method was validated. All samples tested with this method were RCL negative. Two samples 
in study ALD-104 had detectable levels, however below the limit of quantification (<10 copies/0.2 µg 
DNA).

A bioassay was intended for the confirmation of RCL. Since all samples were negative at screening, this 
assay was not used for samples included in this MAA.  
Integration site analysis (ISA) 
ISA determines patterns of integration of Lenti-D LVV in gDNA from peripheral blood of subjects 
treated with eli-cel and identifies the relative contribution of individual IS over time to define an 
increase or decrease in the contribution of individual IS. ISA was based on two published methods 
(Schmidt et al. 2001, 2007) and performed as a qualified and validated method at GeneWerk 
(Heidelberg, Germany).  
From 2014 up to 31 May 2019, ISA was done by standard linear amplification PCR (LAM-PCR) and non-
restricted LAM-PCR (nrLAM-PCR); together referred to as [nr]LAM-PCR. [nr]LAMPCR was the assay of 
choice in the early stages of our clinical studies because of its sensitivity in detecting low-abundance 
integration sites (IS) in samples with a low VCN. However, the use of restriction enzymes in [nr]LAM-
PCR can introduce amplification biases that can result in inaccurate estimations of IS frequencies 
(abundance).  
For [nr]LAM-PCR, peripheral blood gDNA was subjected to PCR using biotinylated primers that 
hybridize to the 3'-region of the LTR of the vector. This was followed by magnetic capture of the 
biotinylated PCR-products, double-strand DNA synthesis, restriction digestion as relevant, and addition 
of linker adaptors containing a molecular barcode. The digested fragments were then subjected to 
exponential PCR using nested vector- and adaptor-specific biotinylated primers. The PCR products were 
then subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis to identity unique, mappable 
integration sites and to determine their relative frequency amongst all IS. The data was then analysed 
to determine whether predominant clones were present, with a semi-quantitative readout.   
As of 01 June 2019, samples were analysed by shearing extension primer tag selection ligation-
mediated polymerase chain reaction (S-EPTS/LM-PCR). S-EPTS/LM-PCR substantially minimizes the 
risk that individual IS may be masked, as may happen with [nr]LAM-PCR if the next restriction site is 
very close in distance to the vector integrant and thus not able to be mapped to the host genome (S-
EPTS/LM-PCR Validation Report Summary, 24 June 2020).  
For S-EPTS/LM-PCR, sheared gDNA was purified, and primer extension was performed using an LTR 
specific biotinylated primer. The extension product was again purified, followed by magnetic capture of 
the biotinylated DNA. The captured DNA was then ligated to linker cassettes, including a molecular 
barcode and the ligation product amplified in the first exponential PCR, using biotinylated vector- and 
linker-cassette-specific primers. The biotinylated PCR-product was magnetically captured and pooled. 
The eluted product was used as template for a second exponential PCR and the product was purified 
and subjected to deep sequencing by MiSeq technology (Illumina) followed by bioinformatics analysis 
to identify unique, mappable integration sites. Positive controls in the validation were genomic DNA 
from clone L2E9 bearing an integration site in RERE gene and clone L3D7 showing an integration site in 
PTPN13 gene as well as genomic DNA derived from a polyclonal lentiviral vector-infected bulk 
population. The method was validated for specificity, linearity, within and between run accuracy and 
precision with acceptance criteria being CV ≤20%. The limit of detection was at a clonal distribution 
0.05%, which corresponds to the detection of 34.09 RERE integration site copies within a pool of 
68,181.8 integration sites.  
Regardless of screening method used, a verification of Relative IS-Frequency of any IS identified as of 
interest, according to protocol-defined criteria (e.g., detected at a frequency of >30% at any 
timepoint, or persistently >10% in Study Protocol ALD-104 v4), is analysed further by qPCR using 
customised IS-specific primers. Customised primers were designed for each IS of interest, and their 
relative contribution to the overall vector copies in the sample, was determined by comparison with the

total number of vector sequences as determined by using primers specific for the psi-gag region of the 
LVV.  
Very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) method 
Fasting serum VLCFA levels were quantified in subjects at screening and at pre-defined intervals post 
eli-cel infusion, to monitor for changes. The validated method used capillary gas chromatography-
electron-capture negative-ion mass spectrometry of fatty acids, based the published method 
(Lagerstedt et al. 2001). Levels of C26:0, C26:1, C24:0, C22:0 and C22:1 were determined, as well as 
the ratios of C24:C22 and C26:22. No validation report was provided. 
 
Conditioning, lymphodepletion and PK monitoring 
 
Myeloablation of the subjects before drug product infusion is required to deplete endogenous HSCs, 
thus allowing repopulation of the subject with HSCs containing the transgene without dilution due to 
the presence of residual unablated cells. Current literature indicates that myeloablation is required for 
effective reconstitution with transplanted HSCs; reduced intensity conditioning generally has shown 
lower rates of donor cell reconstitution. The conditioning included lymphodepletion before Eli-Cel 
infusion because CALD is associated with lymphocytic infiltration. Two different lymphodepletion 
regimens were used; busulfan and cyclophosphamide in study ALD-102 or busulfan and fludarabine in 
study ALD-104, which reflected clinical practice and the introduction of a less toxic conditioning 
regimen. Regardless of conditioning regimen, sufficient lymphodepletion was achieved to allow eli-cel 
treatment.  
ALD-102 
During conditioning, the target daily busulfan AUC range was 4250 to 5250 μM*min and in 26 out of 
31 subjects busulfan AUC was within target range, as estimated by the cumulative busulfan exposure, 
based on measured concentration from the first dose of subsequent dose if required. One subject was 
excluded due to data entry error and the remaining 5 subjects had daily busulfan AUC’s below the 
target range. In order to clarify whether the conditioning was insufficient, the ratio of PB VCN at Month 
6/DP VCN was plotted against estimated average busulfan AUC, denoting no apparent correlation.  
ALD-104 
During conditioning, the target busulfan AUC range was 5340 to 5964 μM*min/L/day and in 6 out of 13 
subjects busulfan AUC was within target range. The remaining 7 subjects had daily busulfan AUC’s 
below the target range. In 6 of these subjects, busulfan doses were gradually increased following low 
initial AUC values and subsequently AUC fell within target range. One subject with initial busulfan AUC 
above target range fell below after dose adjustment. All subjects experienced effective myeloablation 
and afterwards production of gene modified cells, also the seven patients who had busulfan daily 
average AUC below target interval. 
Special populations 
No data is available in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function. All patients were male, as the 
disease affects predominantly males. 
Eli-cel is dosed on the basis of the number of CD34+ cells per kg body weight, a practice that is 
followed for bone marrow transplantation, including treatment using allo-HSCT for children who have 
CALD. No correlation was observed between body weight and PB VCN or PB %ALDP+ cells. No dose 
adjustments are required for overweight subjects.  
Given the target population, no elderly were included in clinical trials with eli-cel.

Interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Eli-cel is not expected to interact with the 
hepatic cytochrome P 450 family of enzymes or drug transporters. 
Patients should not take anti-retroviral medicinal products from at least one month prior to 
mobilisation until apheresis is completed. 
The safety of immunisation with attenuated viral vaccines during or following eli-cel treatment has not 
been studied. In clinical studies, patients received attenuated vaccines following eli-cel treatment. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
In the pivotal study ALD-102, median PB VCN was 0.751 c/dg in PBLs, and 0.932 c/dg in CD14+ cells 
after 1 month. After 24 months, median PB VCN was 0.436 c/dg in PBLs, and 0.485 c/dg in CD14+ 
cells. The median percentage ALDP+ cells in peripheral blood was 18.75% and 8.35% after 1 and 24 
months, respectively. The median percentage ALDP+ cells in CD14+ cells from peripheral blood was 
29.50% and 17.65% after 1 and 24 months, respectively.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics 
Eli-cel adds functional copies of the ABCD1 cDNA into patients’ HSCs through transduction of 
autologous CD34+ cells with Lenti-D LVV. After eli-cel infusion, transduced CD34+ HSCs engraft in the 
bone marrow, and subsequently differentiate into various cell types, including monocytes that migrate 
to the brain where they further differentiate into long-lived macrophages and cerebral microglia that 
can produce functional ALDP and replace deficient microglial cells. The functional ALDP can then enable 
the local degradation of VLCFAs in the brain, which in turn can stabilize the disease by preventing 
further inflammation and demyelination. Following successful engraftment with genetically modified 
cells, the expression of functional ALDP is expected to be lifelong. 
No dedicated pharmacodynamics study was performed, instead various 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were measured in all clinical studies of eli-cel (ALD-
102, ALD-104, LTF-304) and serum VLCFAs was also measured in the historical control study ALD-103 
with allo-HSCT as treatment. In the drug product, the median DP VCN was lower in study ALD-102 
(1.20, span 0.5-2.7) than in study ALD-104 (1.70, span 1.2-3.1) and the median DP%LVV+ cells were 
45% (span 19-67%) in study ALD-102 and 63.5% (span 41-84%) in study ALD-104. The median 
number of vector copies per transduced cell (DP VCN/DP%LVV+Cells) was 2.60 (1.8-4.5) in study 
ALD-102 and similar in study ALD-104 (2.65 (2.2-3.7).

Vector copy numbers per cell in peripheral blood was measured both in leukocytes and CD14+ 
monocytes (considered the best proxy for VCN levels in microglia cells in CNS) and was gradually 
declining from initial values of 0.75 to 0.9 over the initial 12 months after treatment, after which it 
stabilised at about 0.5 in both cell types through month 60. In the study ALD-102, by-subject VCN in 
PBLs and CD14+ over time demonstrated intra-individual and interindividual variation, which was 
attributable to high values observed in two subjects. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 45/136 
 
Proportion of ALDP positive cells (%ALDP+) was substantially increased through month 60 compared 
to low baseline values, but gradually declined throughout the measurement period from its highest 
values at month 1 post treatment for leukocytes, whereas in monocytes it appeared to stabilise from 
month 12.  
The serum very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) concentration was gradually decreased over the 24 
months in study ALD-102 reaching the largest decrease of -20%, as measured by C26:0 LysoPC. In 
study ALD-104, -22% in C26:0 LysoPC was measured in the 8 patients with month 12 data available. 
However, this decrease was considerably lower than the corresponding results of -61% at month 24 
achieved after allo-HSCT in study ALD-103.  
When analysing the potential relationship between vector copy numbers in peripheral blood with 
effects on VLCFA lowering, there was no correlation. Neither was any correlation seen between cell 
dose and time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment. In addition, no correlation was seen between 
clinical outcome (as measured by MFD-free survival) and vector copy number in the drug product. 
However, it was noted that for 2 of 3 patients not reaching the primary endpoint MFD-free survival at 
month 24, the drug product vector copy number was among the lowest observed at 0.5 c/dg. 
The applicant states that the presence of the transgene is expected to be lifelong after eli-cel infusion. 
Detectable PB VCN up to 60 months after eli-cel infusion, has been demonstrated, but the IQR and 
mean %ALDP+ cells in PB seem to decline over time. The long-term data are, however, limited by few 
subjects. 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional pharmacokinetic characterisation of the product is not possible and not expected for 
GTMPs (Gene Therapy Medicinal Products). As stated in the GTMP guideline (EMA/CAT/80183/2014), 
PK studies should focus on the distribution, persistence, clearance and mobilisation of the GTMP and 
address the risk of germline transmission. These are described in the pharmacodynamics section and 
consequently in section 5.1 of the SmPC instead of section 5.2, which is acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
Cell sorting 
The cell sorting method – at both locations – is considered fit for its purpose. Differences of purity of 
the different cell types are seen for the two methods. There is no consequence of the purity on 
subsequent analyses as there is no difference in the transduction of the different nucleated leukocytes.   
Vector copy number 
The qPCR method at PPD is considered adequate for the measurement of VCN as sufficient sensitivity, 
linearity, specificity, intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy and long-term stability were 
demonstrated.  
The qPCR method at CCHMC and PPD use a different gene for normalisation. As the assays are based 
on genomic DNA the impact of this difference on assay outcome is likely to be minimal. All results were 
reported as copies/cell in the clinical studies.  
ALDP+ cells 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 46/136 
 
The CCHMC method has shown sufficient specificity, sensitivity, precision, consistency and 
reproducibility and can be considered qualified for the intended use. LOD was 1.5% ALDP+ cells, while 
LOQ was ca 4% using the CCHMC assay. 
Clarification on the PPD assay was provided, LLOQ was 3% ALDP + cells. Untransduced cells (healthy 
and CALD patients´) are below LLOQ. ALDP+ cells referred to low expressing ALPD cells, while 
ALDP++ were high expressing cells. The gating strategy had to be revised after observation of 
different staining profiles in study samples compared to the spiked samples used in the method 
qualification. It is understood that the revised gating strategy was applied to all clinical study samples. 
The assay is considered fit for the intended purpose.   
RCL 
The ELISA assay was not fully validated according to GL, in particular the criteria for setting the 
cutpoint were not based on 50 different donors. However, issues were identified with the assay, 
leading to the use of an alternative method. Clarification was provided on which data from study ALD-
102 was is solely based on the ELISA assay. Since all results were negative, the issue is not pursued.  
The qPCR method was confirmed to be identical to that described by Sastry et al. The method has 
acceptable reproducibility and sensitivity.  
Linearity, intra and inter-day precision and accuracy of the qPCR method are not specifically addressed 
in the method qualification. Since the method is sensitive and reproducible, it may nevertheless be 
considered appropriate for the use as a screening assay for RCL.  
The confirmatory co-culture assay is reproducible with positive controls of a well-described virus, the 
assay is deemed fit for its purpose. Of note, the assay was not used as all samples were negative at 
screening.  
Integration site analysis 
The [nr]LAM-PCR method was only described in the summary of clinical biopharmaceutics and was not 
validated nor GLP compliant, however, according to the applicant the methods were “fit-for-purpose” 
and conducted with a focus on high quality and reliability. Sufficient information is provided to give 
confidence in the assay and the outcome of the analysis. Therefore, and also given the specificities and 
complexities of the assay and subsequent analysis, the absence of validation and GLP compliance is 
accepted.  
The S-EPTS/LM-PCR was adequately validated; it is however not CE marked.  
Very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) method 
No details were provided on the validation of the VLCFA method. As this is a standard diagnosis 
procedure, this is acceptable, and the method is considered fit for its purpose. 
Conditioning, lymphodepletion and PK monitoring 
The conditioning included lymphodepletion before eli-Cel infusion because CALD is associated with 
lymphocytic infiltration. Two different lymphodepletion regimens were used; busulfan and 
cyclophosphamide in study ALD-102 or busulfan and fludarabine in study ALD-104. The applicant 
clarified that this reflected the evolving clinical practice, with the introduction of a less toxic 
conditioning regimen. Regardless of conditioning regimen, sufficient lymphodepletion was achieved to 
allow eli-cel treatment.  
The applicant provided the missing plots to support the adequacy of the conditioning. In study ALD-
102, the ratio of PB VCN at Month 6/DP VCN was plotted against estimated average busulfan AUC. No 
correlation was found.  
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 47/136 
 
In study ALD-104, the applicant investigated whether the conditioning was sufficient by monitoring of 
white blood cell counts. It indicated that all subjects in Study ALD-104 were effectively myeloablated, 
including subjects with busulfan AUC below target range.  
Special populations 
Limited data is available on special populations. Organ function, gender, age or race are not expected 
to have an impact on the PK/PD.   
The patients in the development programme constitute a homogenous population and the small 
numbers do not allow to identify intrinsic factors related to safety or efficacy. The pharmacokinetics in 
elderly and patients with impaired renal- or hepatic function has not been investigated, which is 
acceptable. Due to the nature of the disease, age is not of relevance. Likewise, as the product does not 
exert conventional PK like small-molecules, impaired renal- or hepatic function is not expected to 
impact the exposure-safety or exposure-efficacy relationship. 
Bodyweight and the administered dose did not have a significant effect on PD outcomes, thus capping 
of the dose is not necessary in adolescents and overweight paediatric patients.  
Interactions 
The lack of interaction study is acceptable. The interaction potential is expected to be low given the 
nature of the medicinal product. Similarly, the lack of data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
is acceptable in view of the nature of the medicinal product. 
The contraindication for anti-retroviral products is related to the manufacturing of the product and is 
acceptable. 
Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics data 
The PD of Eli-cel has been established in accordance with the requirements of the Guideline on quality, 
non-clinical and clinical aspects of medicinal products containing genetically modified cells 
(EMA/CAT/GTWP/671639/2008 Rev. 1). Stem cell engraftment has been confirmed by investigating 
VCN in PBLs and CD14+ cells over time and production of pharmacologically active levels of target 
ALDP+ PBLs and CD14+ cells. 
With regards to drug product (DP) attributes, the median DP VCN was lower in study ALD-102 (1.20, 
span 0.5-2.7) than in study ALD-104 (1.70, span 1.2-3.1). This is at least partly related to the DP VCN 
specification lower limit being increased from 0.5 to 0.7 c/dg on 19 Jan 2017, when study ALD-102 
was ongoing and study ALD-104 had not started yet. The difference between the studies in DP VCN is 
also reflected in the median DP%LVV+ cells, being 45% (span 19-67%) in study ALD-102 and 63.5% 
(span 41-84%) in study ALD-104. 
In study ALD-102, the peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes VCN and CD14+ VCN over time was higher 
during the initial 6-12 months after eli-cel gene therapy but stabilised at a lower level thereafter. By 
month 1 after receiving eli-cel, median (min, max) VCN was 0.751 (0.10, 1.88) c/dg for PBLs and 
0.932 (0.11, 1.82) c/dg for CD14+ cells. By month 60, the median (min, max) VCN was 0.64 (0.14, 
1.51) for PBLs and 0.66 (0.14, 1.57) for CD14+ cells.  
In study ALD-104, by month 1 median (min, max) VCN was 1.25 (0.69, 1.88) c/dg for PBLs and 1.59 
(0.82, 2.81) c/dg for CD14+ cells. By month 6, which was the latest data cut-off point for the MA 
application, the median (min, max) VCN was 1.57 (1.00, 3.13) for PBLs and 1.59 (1.26, 3.82) for 
CD14+ cells. Thus, it appears that peripheral blood and CD14+ cells vector copy numbers were 
somewhat higher in study ALD-104. In both studies, high variability in PB VCN and CD14+ cells were 
attributable to a few subjects.

In study ALD-102 and LTF-304, the median %ALDP+ cells in peripheral blood increased from 0.87% at 
baseline to 18.75% at month 1 and then gradually decreased down to 4.25% at month 60, albeit with 
high intersubject variability. For the CD14+ cells, the median %ALDP+ cells appeared somewhat more 
stable, increasing from 1% at baseline to 29.5% at month 1 and still at 21.25% at month 60 (also with 
high inter-subject variability). Similar results were seen for the initial 6 months of study ALD-104. 
Since ALDP is not a secreted protein, normal values in different cell types in healthy individuals are not 
known. The assay for cells expressing transgenic ALDP was designed to yield cells producing normal 
levels of ALDP from endogenous ABCD1 genes ALDP negative. In contrast, virtually all cells producing 
ALDP from the transgenic ABCD1 cDNA will be ALDP+ because the transgenic cells over-express the 
transgenic ALDP. It is further not known what percentage of ALDP+ cells are needed for a beneficial 
effect in CALD patients. The only conclusions that may be drawn is that the majority of eli-cel treated 
subjects have ALDP+ in CD14+ cells in peripheral blood. 
Thus, no intracellular normal values of ALDP are known and the percentage of ALDP-positive CD14+ 
cells of a mean 18-28% over month 1-60 after eli-cel treatment may only indicate a higher than 
normal presence of ALDP in the positive cells. 
The applicant states that the presence of the transgene is expected to be lifelong after Eli-infusion. 
Detectable PB VCN up to 60 months after Eli-cel infusion, has been demonstrated, but the IQR and 
mean %ALDP+ cells in periphery blood seem to decline over time. Thirteen patients have been 
observed > 60 months. The applicant has presented updated results showing persistence of 
transduced HSCs over time. VCN levels do not appear to decrease extensively over time, neither in 
PBLs nor CD14+ cells. Results for %ALDP+ Cells are less clear and indicate a decrease at month 60 for 
%ALDP+ cells in PBL. Monitoring of the maintenance of efficacy is an important measure post-
approval.   
With regards to the effects on lowering of serum VLCFAs, it is noticed that the percent change from 
baseline at month 6, 12 and 24 for C26:0 LysoPC (+5%, -6%, -20%) and C26:0/C22:0 ratio (-11%, -
14%, -15%) was considerably lower in study ALD-102 compared to the corresponding values from 
study ALD-103 TPES population (C26:0 LysoPC: -46%, -63%, -61%, C26:0/C22:0 ratio: -40%, -38%, 
-29%).When comparing the VLCFA results from ALD-103 it may be concluded that allo-HSCT shifted 
these values towards the range of female ALD carriers (C26:0/C22:0 ratio lowest value at month 12: 
169 (min-max 125-342), C26:0 LysoPC lowest value at month 12: 0.05 (min-max 0.03-0.06)) and eli-
cel treatment in study ALD-102 did the same, but to a lesser degree (C26:0/C22:0 ratio lowest value 
at month 24: 355 (min-max 161-603), C26:0 LysoPC lowest value at month 12 and 24: 0.06 (min-
max 0.04-0.09)). However, neither treatment was even close to normalising the VLCFA values. 
The applicant states that it is not known if there is a threshold for VLCFA toxicity and that serum levels 
of VLCFAs do not correlate with the clinical severity or phenotype of ALD in males. Even though 85% of 
heterozygote ALD women have elevated VLCFAs, still very few women develop CALD. In conclusion, 
the level of reduction of serum VLCFA levels do not enable a prediction of the likelihood of clinical 
benefit for the treated CALD subjects. 
The PD markers generally displayed maintained levels over long-term follow up to month 60 in study 
LTF-304. 
The pharmacodynamic endpoints PB VCN and %ALDP+ cells are investigated in the studies ALD-102, 
ALD-104 and LTF-304. However, fewer exploratory PD endpoints were investigated in ALD-104 and 
LTF-304. All PK/PD correlations were presented initially only for study ALD-102. The applicant provided 
an updated analysis with data from study ALD-104, which supported prior conclusions from study ALD-
102.

In both ALD-102 and ALD-104 (although without statistical significance due to the low number of 
subjects for study ALD-104), DP VCN correlated both with PB VCN and %ALDP+, which is indicative of 
engraftment of the transduced cells. Consequently, PB VCN also correlates with %ALDP+. There was 
however no clear correlation of PB VCN with VLCFA levels.  
No correlation was observed between cell dose and day of either neutrophil or platelet engraftment.  
The applicant states that the lack of correlation of cell dose with the Day of neutrophil or platelet 
engraftment in Study ALD-102 suggests that even the lowest dose received (5.0 × 106 CD34+ 
cells/kg) is adequate for eli-cel to effectively reconstitute the haematopoietic system of subjects.  
There was also no clear correlation between PD measures such as DP VCN and clinical outcome. 
However, it is noted that the DP VCNs were among the lowest (0.5 c/dg) for one subject in study ALD-
102 who developed MFD and also for one other subject who received allo-HSCT after being 
discontinued form study ALD-102. For the other subject who was discontinued to receive allo-HSCT, 
the DP VCN was 1.2 c/dg, which corresponds to the median DP VCN for study ALD-102.  
Two of the three subjects in study ALD-102 who didn’t achieve MFD-free survival at month 24 had DP 
VCN among the lowest (0.5 c/dg) in the study. The applicant states that from the Oct 2020 data cut-
off, study ALD-102 results show an ‘optimal outcome’ with DP VCN ≥0.7 c/dg and subjects with 
‘suboptimal outcome’ (here defined as MFD, or study withdrawal, or NFS change ≥ 2 at any time) 
tended to cluster amongst subjects with the lowest PD parameters. It is noted that among the N=6 
subjects with DP VCN below 0.7 c/dg in study ALD-102, the mean Loes score change from baseline at 
latest assessment was 8.1 (min/max: 0-18.5, median 6.75) vs a mean 4.0 change from baseline for 
the whole study population (N=32) in ALD-102. This is supportive of the decision in 2017 to change 
the DP VCN specification lower limit from 0.5 to 0.7 c/dg. This change has led to higher DP and PD 
data for ALD-104 than ALD-102, with the median DP VCN being 1.60 vs 1.20 and substantially higher 
median VCN and %ALDP+ in CD14+ cells at month 12 (1.64 vs 0.50 c/dg, 38.6% vs 17.2%). Looking 
at the preliminary clinical results, the superior PD data in study ALD-104 have not translated into an 
apparent better clinical outcome so far, as measured in median Loes score at month 12 (6.5 (N=8) vs 
3.0 (N=32)). The applicant has clarified that clinical decisions with regards to follow-up or patient care 
/ additional treatment may not be based on PD marker data, since no clear correlation between PD 
markers and clinical outcome has been established.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Because of the nature of Skysona, conventional PK data based on absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
and excretion is not expected. Acceptable methods were developed to investigate the 
pharmacodynamics in terms of vector copy number, ALDP protein expression and for safety, the 
detection of replication competent lentivirus. The conditioning regimens were also found acceptable.  
The applicant has shown that about 50% of CD34+ cells in the drug product are transduced with the 
transgene in both clinical studies on eli-cel (ALD-102 and ALD-104). Furthermore, the transgene is 
localised in peripheral blood leukocytes and CD14+ cells, the latter corresponding to the CD14+ cells 
migrating to the CNS and contributing to the therapeutic effects of eli-cel. However, it has not been 
convincingly demonstrated that this leads to a clinically relevant increase in % of ALDP+ cells or 
lowering of VLCFAs in plasma, nor is it known to which extent plasma levels correspond to levels in the 
CNS. Thus, the PD results confirm that the drug product contains the transgene, but no relation to 
clinical effects have been demonstrated.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The main evidence of efficacy comes from study ADL-102. Data from the ongoing study ALD-104 and 
long term follow up ALD-304 support the safety and efficacy of the product. Studies ALD-101 and ALD-
103 are historical control studies describing disease progression and neurological decline in untreated 
CALD patients or allo-HSCT treated patients.

2.5.1.  Dose-response studies  
No dose-response study was performed.  
Dosing rationale: 
The dose of eli-cel drug product is a single intravenous dose of ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg patient 
weight.  
The applicant states that the minimum CD34+ dose accepted as safe practice and associated with 
favourable engraftment kinetics in allo-HSCT is approximately 1.5 × 106 to 3.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg. 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 51/136 
 
However, optimal neutrophil and platelet engraftment has been reported to occur at doses around 5.0 
× 106 CD34+ cells/kg.  
To date, a total of 45 subjects (32 subjects in Study ALD-102 and 13 subjects in Study ALD‑104) have 
received doses of 5.0 to 38.2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg, and the lack of correlation of cell dose with the 
time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment suggests that even the lowest dose received (5.0 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg) is adequate for eli-cel to effectively reconstitute the haematopoietic system of 
subjects. Thus ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is the recommended dose for eli-cel. 
No upper dose limit is specified. For subject safety, only the minimum number of 
mobilisation/apheresis cycles are performed to collect sufficient cells required for drug product 
manufacturing to meet the minimum dose. Therefore, it is not practicable to determine a maximal 
tolerable cell dose. To the applicant’s knowledge, there is no maximum recommended dose of CD34+ 
cells for infusion of autologous cell products in the literature. Adverse events due to high CD34+ cell 
dose have not been reported in studies with allo-HSCT or in eli-cel clinical studies. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Pivotal study ALD-102 
Study ALD-102 is an international multi-site, non-randomised, open label, single-dose, single-arm, 
prospective phase 2/3 study in male subjects with CALD treated with eli-cel. 
The study is ongoing; it started in 2013 and the Interim study report with the Data cut-off: 17 January 
2020 was produced for the Marketing authorisation application. 
Methods 
Study participants  
Male subjects aged 17 years and younger with active cerebral ALD as defined by elevated VLCFA 
values and active central nervous system (CNS) disease established by central radiographic review of 
brain MRI demonstrating Loes score between 0.5 and 9 (inclusive) on the 34-point scale, and 
Gadolinium enhancement (GdE+) on MRI of demyelinating lesions. The neurologic function scale (NFS) 
of ≤1. The main exclusion criterion was availability of a willing 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor 
(excluding female heterozygotes). 
Treatments 
Mobilisation and Apheresis 
Subjects were mobilised with G-CSF for 4 to 6 days.  
Apheresis was performed per standard clinical site practice. Up to 3 total collections could be 
performed as part of any one mobilisation cycle until the target of 12 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg was 
obtained for transduction. 
Conditioning 
Pre-conditioning assessments were performed 11 days prior to eli-cel infusion (defined as Rel Day -11; 
with a window of -3 days, i.e. Rel Day -14 through Rel Day -11) prior to myeloablative conditioning. If 
neurological decline was observed, as evidenced by a NFS > 1 or a Loes Score > 9, the subject was 
discontinued from the study.

EMA/332184/2021  
Page 52/136 
 
Conditioning only began once eli-cel was dispositioned for clinical use and the drug product was at the 
clinical site. Myeloablative and lymphodepleting conditioning was performed on an in-patient basis 
using first busulfan IV followed by cyclophosphamide IV. 
Weight-based dosing of busulfan IV was administered on Rel Days -10, -9, -8, and -7 and weight-
based dosing of cyclophosphamide IV was administered on Rel Days -5, -4, -3, and -2. 
Eli-cell treatment 
 
Infusion of eli-cel was given approximately 48 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide.  
The dose administered was ≥ 5.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg. 
Prohibited concomitant therapies 
Medications used to lower VLCFA levels (e.g., Lorenzo’s oil, statins) and other investigational therapies 
were excluded during study participation. In addition, subjects were not to start a new low-fat diet 
during study participation. There were no other excluded concomitant medications or vaccines. 
Objectives 
The objective of the current study was to demonstrate that treatment with eli-cel is able to stabilize 
the disease at a level of neurological function that preserves the capacity for independent living  for 
subjects with CALD, i.e. that the patients didn’t develop any major functional disabilities (MFDs).  
The second objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of eli-cel in subjects with CALD. 
Success criterion 
In accordance with prior Regulatory Agency advice, the success criterion for this study was based on a 
comparison of the ALD‑102 primary efficacy endpoint for the Initial Cohort to a clinically meaningful 
benchmark, such that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact CI of Month 24 MFD-free survival 
must be > 50% in order for the primary endpoint to be met. 
This clinically meaningful benchmark of 50% is supported by the Study ALD-101 untreated study 
population, who were GdE+ at any time, as well as data from the ALD-101 allo-HSCT treated 
population, now published in the literature (Raymond et al., 2018). There is additional supportive 
context from disease-specific literature that reports on overall survival rather than MFD-free survival 
(Baumann et al., 2003; Beam et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2011; Peters et al., 2004). As patients can and 
do progress through MFDs to death, the results of these studies can be   further informative to this   
benchmark. In Study ALD-101, the Month 24 MFD-free survival rate in untreated GdE+ subjects within 
2 years of their first GdE+ MRI was 21% (exact 95% CIs of 6.1% to 45.6%). Thus, this benchmark 
value is above the upper bound of the 95% CI of the Month 24 MFD-free survival in untreated subjects 
in Study ALD-101.  
In Study ALD-101, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact CI of the Month 24 MFD-free survival 
rate in GdE+, early disease (NFS≤1, Loes ≥0.5 and ≤9) subjects without a matched sibling donor and 
treated with allo-HSCT was 50.1% (mean 76% with exact 95% CI of 50.1% to 93.2%).   
An MFD-free survival rate at various timepoints ranging between approximately 50% to 90% is 
reported in existing literature for patients with CALD treated with allo-HSCT. Peters et al. reported that 
53.4% of subjects treated with early clinical disease had no neurological progression and remained 
functional; the 5-year survival for subjects with 0 to 1 clinical symptoms at baseline was 67% to 70% 
(Peters et al., 2004). Miller et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of 91% (95% CI 69% to 98%) for 
patients with a baseline NFS of 0, and 89% (95% CI 70% to 96%) for patients with a baseline Loes 
score <10. The follow-up median NFS for both cohorts was 0, with an interquartile range of 0 to 0 
(NFS of 0) and 0 to 1 (Loes score <10) (Miller et al., 2011). Both of these studies included subjects

with matched sibling donors; however, subjects with a willing 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor are 
excluded from the ALD-102 study. 
Similar rates are reported in two smaller studies; Beam et al and Bauman et al. Beam et al. reported 
an overall survival of 73% after approximately 4 years of follow-up post-allo-HSCT. Of the 6 patients 
who had baseline Loes scores ≤9, 5 (83%) patients were alive and functional (Beam et al., 2007). 
Baumann et al. reported 42% functional survival after approximately 3.7 years of follow-up. Of the 7 
patients who had baseline Loes scores of ≤9 and GdE+, 6 (85.7%) patients were alive and functional 
(Baumann et al., 2003). The subjects in these studies had similarities to the ALD-102 study 
population: both Beam et al. and Baumann et al. reported on subjects with baseline Loes scores ≤9 
and the subjects in the Baumann comparison were gadolinium positive at baseline. Thus, a mean MFD-
free survival rate greater than 70% would be consistent with the statistics reported in the literature. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
Proportion of subjects who were alive and have none of the 6 major functional disabilities (MFDs) at 
Month 24 Visit (i.e. Month 24 MFD-free survival). MFDs were defined as: 
o loss of communication 
o cortical blindness 
o tube feeding 
o total incontinence 
o wheelchair dependence 
o complete loss of voluntary movement 
In addition to experiencing any MFDs or death, the following events were also considered as a failure 
to meet the primary efficacy endpoint: requirement for rescue cell administration or an allo-HSCT, 
withdrawal from study, or lost to follow-up by Month 24. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included MFD-free survival over time, Overall survival, Proportion of 
subjects who demonstrated resolution of gadolinium positivity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 
i.e., GdE-) at Month 24, Time to sustained resolution of gadolinium positivity on MRI (i.e., GdE-). 
Sustained is defined as gadolinium resolution without a subsequent evaluation indicating gadolinium 
positivity, Change in total Neurologic Function Score (NFS) from Baseline to Month 24 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints at Month 24 included Proportion of subjects who maintained an 
NFS ≤ 4 without an increase of > 3 points from Baseline, Change in Loes score from Baseline, 
Proportion of subjects who maintained a Loes score ≤ 9 or did not increase their Loes score by≥ 6 
points from Baseline, Change from Baseline to Month 24 in neuropsychological tests (data not 
presented), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) score, Global Assessment Scores

Sample size 
The number of subjects planned to be infused with Lenti-D Drug Product is approximately 30. The 
sample size was not determined by formal statistical methods.  
The study was initially designed to enrol up to 15 subjects in order to obtain at least 12 evaluable 
subjects.  As of October 2015, under protocol versions 2.0-6.2, there were 17 subjects enrolled and 
treated with Lenti-D Drug Product. Analysis of these 17 subjects will be the basis for determining the 
success or failure of the study.

- 
Initial Study Cohort: includes the first 18 subjects screened in ALD-102 (under protocol 
versions 2.0-6.2). Within this cohort, 1 subject failed screening and did not receive any study 
treatment, while 17 subjects enrolled in the study and were treated with Lenti-D Drug Product. 
- 
Month 24 Evaluable Subjects for MFD-free Survival: defined as subjects treated with Lenti-D 
Drug Product and have been followed for 24 months (Rel Day of last contact (DLC) ≥730), or 
have completed the Month 24 visit, or had discontinued from the study but would have been 
followed for 24 months (Rel Day of data cut ≥730) if still in the study, at the time of the data 
cut for initial analysis. The 17 treated subjects in Initial Study Cohort constitute part of the 
Month 24 Evaluable Subjects.  
- 
Overall Study Cohort: includes all screened subjects at the time of the data cut. This cohort 
includes the Initial Study Cohort as well as the additional subjects who were screened 
afterwards.  
Planned analyses for this study include the following:  
- 
Initial Analysis: to be performed after the Initial Study Cohort (enrolled under protocol versions 
2.0-6.2) complete the study or when the sponsor deems appropriate. This analysis includes all 
data from Initial Study Cohort, Month 24 Evaluable Subjects for Month 24 MFD-free Survival, 
and the Overall Study Cohort, at the time of the data cut.  
- 
Final Analysis: to be performed when all subjects treated with Lenti-D Drug Product complete 
the study. 
Analysis populations were following:  
• 
The Intent-to-treat population (ITT) consisted of subjects who initiate any study procedures, 
beginning with stimulation by G-CSF. 
• 
The Transplant population (TP) consisted of subjects who received Lenti-D Drug Product.  
• 
The Successful Neutrophil Engraftment Population (NEP) consisted of subjects who achieved 
neutrophil engraftment defined as having 3 consecutive ANC laboratory values of ≥0.5×109 
cells/L (after initial post-infusion nadir) obtained on different days by 42 days post-infusion of 
Lenti-D Drug Product.  
Because the ITT, TP, and NEP populations were identical in this interim analysis, all results are 
reported for the TP, also referred to as the “Overall Cohort TP”. Some results are also presented for the 
“Initial Cohort TP”, defined as the first 17 subjects treated with drug product. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects who have success in Month-24 MFD-free 
survival, which is a binary endpoint. To be considered a success for the primary endpoint, a subject 
must meet all following criteria: 
1. Be alive at the Month 24 Visit. 
2. Have not developed any of the MFDs by the Month 24 Visit. 
3. Have not received rescue cell administration or allo-HSCT by the Month 24 Visit. 
4. Have not withdrawn from the study or been lost to follow-up by the Month 24 Visit. 
For the primary analysis, the number and percent of subjects who achieve Month 24 MFD-free survival 
was presented with the exact 95% CI (obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method) for the TP in the 
Initial Study Cohort and in the cohort of the Month-24 Evaluable Subjects for MFD-free Survival (the 
data cut for the Initial Analysis). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval of the 
Month 24 MFD-free survival rate must be >50% in order for the primary endpoint to be met.

For a sensitivity analysis, failures for Month-24 MFD-free survival only included failures that occur on 
or before Rel Day 730. This sensitivity analysis was only to be conducted when it is different from the 
primary analysis. Number and percent of subjects with failure was reported with 2-sided 95% CI.  
The analyses of the secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints were performed on the TP. The time-
to-event analysis of MFD-free survival and overall survival was based on the Kaplan-Meier 
methodology. Event rates and 95% CIs at 12 and 24 months, respectively, post Lenti-D Drug Product 
infusion (DPI), and the restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 24 months post DPI were also 
presented. For the endpoints stable NFS at Month 24 and stable Loes score at Month 24, evaluable 
subjects are defined as subjects who have non-missing Baseline values and have non-missing Month 
24 assessment results for the corresponding parameter. 
 
The primary safety endpoint was the proportion of subjects who have experienced either acute 
(≥Grade II) or chronic GVHD at Month 24 in the TP population. It was designated the primary safety 
endpoint mainly for comparisons with CALD subjects who received allo-HSCT, particularly in studies 
ALD-101 and ALD-103, which was detailed in the inter-study SAP. The general safety profile of 
treatment with Lenti-D Drug Product was summarised through the longitudinal evaluation of AEs, 
laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG and physical examination findings. Safety parameters were 
summarised across each time point. 
In general, there were no substitutions made to accommodate missing data points. Subjects who 
discontinued prior to the Month 24 visit were considered treatment failures in the primary efficacy 
analysis. No multiplicity adjustment was made in the primary analysis as it was performed on the 
initial cohort as prespecified. 
A separate inter-study SAP describes comparisons of data from this study and its long-term extension 
Study LTF-304 with data from a retrospective study of CALD (Study ALD-101) and an observational 
study of allo-HSCT-treated patients with CALD (Study ALD-103). 
Changes of the analyses 
The study was initially designed to enrol up to 15 subjects in order to obtain at least 12 evaluable 
subjects. As of October 2015, under protocol versions 2.0-6.2, there were 17 subjects enrolled and 
treated with Lenti-D Drug Product as well as 1 screen failure. Analysis of these 17 subjects will be the 
basis for determining the success or failure of the study. In order to obtain experience with the 
European contract manufacturing organisation and to continue to provide a treatment option for 
patients who could benefit from Lenti-D Drug Product in a controlled setting, the Study protocol was 
later amended to treat approximately 30 subjects. Despite the addition of this second cohort of 
subjects, the nature of the primary analysis (based on the cohort of the first 17 treated subjects) has 
not changed. A final analysis will be performed as supportive when all subjects complete the study.

Efficacy 
The study success criterion for efficacy: Month 24 MFD-free survival 
 
Success criterion for efficacy was based upon having a lower 95% CI of > 50.0% for the endpoint of 
Month 24 MFD-free survival for the Initial Cohort. This was based on comparison of the primary 
efficacy endpoint results for the Initial Cohort TP (N = 17) to a clinically meaningful benchmark.  
Table 8 MFD-Free Survival at Month 24 (TP) 
 
Abbrev.: allo-HSCT, allogeneic stem cell transplantation; MFD, major functional disability 
a Evaluable subjects are defined as subjects who have been followed for 24 months (i.e. Rel DLC ≥ 730) or have completed the 
Month 24 Visit, or discontinued from the study but would have been followed for 24 months if still on the study (i.e. Rel Day of data 
cut ≥ 730), at the time of the data cut. 
b Month-24 MFD-Free survival criteria defined as: alive at 24 months post infusion; have not developed any of the MFDs by 24 
months post infusion; have not received rescue cell administration or allo-HSCT by 24 months post infusion; and have not 
withdrawn from the study or lost to follow-up by 24 months post infusion. 
c Exact 95% CIs is obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
d In sensitivity analysis, only death and MFDs are considered failures. 
Initial Cohort 
In the Initial Cohort, 15/17 or 88.2 % (95% CI 63.6, 98.5) of subjects infused with eli-cel met the 
primary endpoint (Month 24 MFD-free survival). 
Because the lower bound (63.6%) is above the threshold of 50%, the study efficacy success criterion 
was met. 
In the Initial Cohort, 2/17 subjects failed to achieve the primary endpoint:  
One subject developed 4 MFDs (total incontinence at month 9, cortical blindness and loss of 
communication at month 12, and wheelchair dependence at month 21). This subject subsequently died 
at month 21 from disease progression. 
Another subject did not develop any MFDs but was withdrawn from the study at month 13 post-
treatment to undergo an allo-HSCT due to increased Loes score (+7), NFS (+1) and re-emergence of 
contrast enhancement on MRI (GdE+). At Baseline, this subject had a Loes score of 2.0, NFS of 0, was 
GdE+, and had a Loes Pattern 3 (associated with slower progression). At last evaluation in Study ALD-
102 before allo-HSCT, he had a Loes Score of 9.0, NFS of 1, was GdE+, and had Loes Pattern 2 
(associated with faster progression). Both subjects were treated at the same site, this subject was

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 63/136 
 
withdrawn a few months after the first subject noted above had his first MFD, thus the applicant states 
that it is possible that the rapid decline of the first subject contributed to the decision to remove this 
second subject from the study. 
Overall Cohort 
In the Overall Cohort, 20/23 or 87.0% (95% CI: 66.4, 97.2) of evaluable subjects infused with eli-cel 
also met the primary endpoint (Month 24 MFD-free survival), with the lower bound (66.4%) that is 
above the threshold of 50%. Meeting this pre-specified clinical benchmark indicates that treatment 
with eli-cel has a significant clinical benefit over no treatment.  
In the Overall Cohort, 3/23 subjects failed to achieve the primary endpoint, including the 2 subjects  in 
the Initial Cohort described above and an additional subject who was withdrawn by the investigator at 
month 16 due to increased Loes score (from 1 to 10, stable NFS at 0 and GdE-) to receive allo-HSCT.

Overall survival 
1 subject of 32 (described above) died 22 months after eli-cel treatment. 
Contrast enhancement 
Figure 4 Contrast Enhancement Status Over Time by Subject (TP) 
 
All subjects were GdE+ on study entry (Inclusion criterion #3), and GdE status was evaluated 
approximately every 3 months after drug product infusion. 
Contrast enhancement is a subjective determination by the neuroradiologist reading the MRI. In an 
attempt to limit the problem of subjectivity, all MRIs were read blindly by a central reader (Dr Loes). 
All subjects who had completed at least their Month 6 Visit became GdE- at some time after drug 
product infusion. However, GdE+ signal re-emerged intermittently in several subjects treated with eli-
cel, although it was frequently designated as “faint”, “weak”, or a “difficult call”. The clinical 
significance of re-emergence of GdE+ in subjects treated with eli-cel is unknown. There was no 
apparent association between GdE status post-infusion and clinical outcome in this study.  
Among the 3 treatment failures, one subject as noted above, who had rapid disease progression and 
died on study, was GdE- on all MRIs after his Month 1 Visit through his final MRI at Month 21 before 
death. Of the two subjects who withdrew to receive allo-HSCT, one was GdE+ at his last 2 MRIs before 
withdrawal, and the other was consistently GdE- for the last 6 MRIs before withdrawal. Seventeen out 
of 21 (81.0%) Month 24 evaluable subjects in the Overall Cohort were GdE- at Month 24. All 4 of the 
subjects who were GdE+ at Month 24 had stable NFS and also had stable Loes scores ranging from 2 
to 8 at Month 24. 
The time to sustained resolution of contrast enhancement (sustained GdE-) was analyzed for all 
subjects. Sustained resolution is defined as having at least two consecutive GdE- results by MRI 
without a subsequent evaluation indicating GdE+. Sixteen of 21 (76.2%) subjects had sustained GdE-

by Month 24. The median (min, max) Rel Day of first GdE- for those who achieved sustained GdE- was 
Rel Day 44.5 (29, 551). 
Change in Total NFS from Baseline to Month 24 
The majority of evaluable subjects (evaluable for Month 24) in the Overall Cohort (20/23, 87.0%) had 
an NFS of 0 at end of study Month 24 Visit. 20/23 (87.0%) evaluable subjects showed no change in 
NFS. 2/23 (8.7%) evaluable subjects had an increase in NFS of ≤3, resulting in an NFS of 1 at Month 
24, which was due to episodes of incontinence in one subject and vision impairment in the other. 1 
subject showed a rapid increase in NFS starting at Month 3. By Month 22 he had an NFS of 17 
including 4 MFDs (loss of communication, cortical blindness, wheelchair dependence, and total 
incontinence) and he subsequently experienced cardiorespiratory arrest and died. These 3 subjects 
with an increase in NFS were all in the initial cohort.

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint:  
Loes Score 
21 subjects were evaluable for Month 24 Loes endpoints. 
Sixteen of the 21 (76.2%) evaluable subjects had a stable Loes score at Month 24, defined as 
maintaining a Loes score ≤ 9 or not increasing their Loes score by ≥ 6 points since Baseline; 10 of 
these subjects had a change of 0 or 1.

Figure 6 Loes Score Over Time by Subject (TP) 
 
Eight subjects had a Loes score > 9, the cut-off for inclusion in this study, at their last follow-up visit. 
For some of these 8 subjects, changes in Loes score were observed at the Month 1 Visit, but the 
majority of changes occurred from Month 6 to Month 18 with some changes presenting later at Month 
24. 
Table 9 Change from Baseline to Month 24 for Select Efficacy Endpoints Stratified by 
Severity of Loes Score at Baseline 
 
As anticipated from previous literature (Moser et al. 2000; Pierpont et al. 2017), subjects in TP102 
with a Baseline Loes score of <4.5 had less evidence of disease progression at Month 24. Subjects with 
Baseline Loes scores of ≥4.5 to ≤ 9 (N=4) generally showed minimal disease progression as measured 
by NFS during this period, but did have larger changes in Loes score, WIQ and PedsQL (based on data 
collected in 2-3 subjects for WIQ and PedsQL). This was expected from reports in literature, but 
importantly the majority of these subjects still showed stabilisation of disease (see by-subject 
discussion in response to Question 78) suggesting eli-cel treatment was beneficial for subjects with 
Loes score ≤ 9.

Neuropsychological Tests 
Subjects underwent a panel of neuropsychological tests, as appropriate for their age, including age 
appropriate Weschler IQ tests. These analyses were exploratory, and the consistency and quality of 
data collected was variable between subjects and between sites. Many study subjects were treated and 
had their IQ evaluated in a country where their native language was not spoken. The scores that are 
obtainable from these tests include performance IQ (PIQ), perceptual reasoning (PRI), fluid reasoning 
(FRI), processing speed index (PSI), working memory index (WMI), verbal IQ (VIQ)/ verbal 
comprehension index (VCI) and full scale IQ (FSIQ).   
The PIQ/PRI/FRI was selected for focus due to this domain’s relevance to the CALD patient population. 
For these analyses, PIQ, PRI and FRI are grouped together, as they assess similar domains and are the 
main assessment of performance IQ for their respective tests. The PIQ/PRI/FRI (hereafter referred to 
as performance IQ [PrIQ]) tests require actual physical handling of certain objects, such as picture 
cards and puzzles, in front of the examiner or psychologist. These assessments attempt to overcome 
biases caused by language, culture, and education which could play a role in interpreting VIQ tests for 
some of the international subjects assessed in the study.

Ongoing Study ALD-104 
This is an ongoing open-label, multi-centre, single-arm, single dose 24-month study in paediatric 
patients with CALD receiving eli-cel After Myeloablative Conditioning Using Busulfan and Fludarabine. 
The study started in 2019 and Data Cut for Interim CSR was on 21 February 2020. At the interim data 
cut for this analysis, 13 subjects had been treated with eli-cel. Enrolment is ongoing. Approximately 35 
subjects are planned to be treated.

Differences in eligibility criteria and treatment compared to study ALD-102: 
• 
The DP VCN specification lower limit was increased from 0.5 to 0.7 c/dg on 19 January 2017. 
• 
The conditioning regimen in study ALD-104 consisted of busulfan and fludarabine used instead 
of bulsulfan and cyclophosphamide as in study ALD-102. 
Study objectives 
• To evaluate the efficacy and safety of eli-cel after myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and 
fludarabine in subjects with CALD 
Study endpoints 
The same as for study ALD-102, although for most endpoints, the month 24 evaluation timepoint has 
not yet been reached. 
Fludarabine Dosing 
Per ALD-104 Protocol V1.1 through ALD-104 Protocol V3.0, fludarabine dosing was as follows: 
On Rel Days -8 and -7 (where Rel Day 1 is defined as day of eli-cel infusion), fludarabine IV (30 
mg/m2) was to be given alone. 
On Rel Days -6, -5, -4, and -3, fludarabine IV (30 mg/m2) was to be given one hour before the first 
daily infusion of busulfan IV. 
With the introduction of ALD-104 Protocol V3.1 for study centres in the US and the UK, and ALD-104 
Protocol V4.0 for all other sites, fludarabine dosing was adjusted such that fludarabine IV (40 mg/m2) 
was to be given on Rel Days -6, -5, -4, and -3, one hour before the first daily infusion of busulfan IV, 
per institutional standards. 
Fludarabine dosing was reduced due to concerns of long-term immune reconstitution, following viral 
adverse events and in light of available literature related to fludarabine dosing in children (Harris et al. 
2018; Langenhorst et al. 2019).  
Statistical methods 
The number of subjects planned to be infused with Lenti-D Drug Product was approximately 20 
according to the SAP (the only version, dated 30 October 2019), but has been increased to 35 in a 
later amended protocol in order to accrue additional efficacy and safety information. 
Analysis populations, the primary endpoint definition, and statistical methods in general, are similar to 
those described for the pivotal study ALD-102. The exception is that for study ALD-104 there was no 
benchmark comparison planned for the primary endpoint, and no separate cohorts were defined for 
interim and final analysis. The planned analysis included interim safety analyses to support regulatory 
submissions and a final analysis when all treated subjects complete the study.

As of the interim data cut for this report, only 7 subjects have completed the Month 6 Visit and no 
subjects have completed the Month 24 Visit. Due to the limited time of follow-up, only preliminary data 
on select pharmacodynamic efficacy endpoints are presented in this interim report (please, refer to PD 
section for these results). 
During the approval procedure, efficacy and PD data for study ALD-104 from the data cut-off of 09 Oct 
2020 have been provided. In total 19 subjects have received eli-cel, all subjects remain on study, no 
MFDs, no deaths, no rescue cell treatment nor rescue allo-HSCT have been performed. The median 
(min, max) duration of follow-up is 8.64 (0.1, 16.8) months. Only 8 subjects have completed their 
Month 12 Visits, and no subjects have reached their Month 18 Visit or beyond. Thus, no efficacy data 
for the primary endpoint MFD-free survival at month 24 are available from this data cut-off. 
Supportive study:  
Ongoing study LTF-304 
A multi-center, non-interventional long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study for subjects with CALD 
who have been treated with eli-cel in the Sponsor’s parent studies, ALD-102 and ALD-104. After 
completion of the parent study (including approximately 2 years of follow-up), subjects are consented 
to enroll in Study LTF-304. During Study LTF-304, subjects are followed every 6 months from 2 years 
through 5 years post-drug product infusion and then annually from 5 years through 15 years post-drug 
product infusion. 
The study started in 2016 and the Data cut-off for interim analysis is 31 Jan 2020 
At the time of data cut-off, 21 patients from study ALD-102 had enrolled in the LTF-304 study, with a 
median (min, max) duration of follow-up of 56.44 (22.1, 70.7) months after drug product infusion.

NFS: 
Figure 9 NFS Over Time by Subject 
 
As seen in the figure above, 3 out of 18 (16.7%) subjects who had assessments after Month 24 had an 
increase in NFS of ≤ 3 at latest assessment compared to parent study ALD-102 Baseline: 
• One subject had an NFS of 0 from parent study ALD-102 Baseline until his Month 24 Visit, at 
which time he experienced episodes of incontinence, resulting in an NFS of 1. This had resolved 
by Month 30, and he maintained an NFS of 0 until his last recorded visit at Month 60, when his NFS 
increased to 1 due to nonfebrile seizures. 
• One subject had an NFS of 0 from parent study ALD-102 Baseline through the Month 48 Visit. At 
Month 54 (last visit prior to data cut date), the subject experienced vision impairment, and his 
NFS increased to 1. 
• One subject developed vision impairment starting at Month 18 (NFS of 1).This subject also 
experienced an SAE of Seizure (Listing 16.2.7.2) within 24 months of drug product infusion (Rel 
Day 722) but this event occurred after his Month 24 assessment for NFS (Rel Day 706) so did not 
contribute to his NFS score at Month 24. He continued to experience both symptoms through his 
last recorded visit before the interim database lock (Month 60; NFS of 2). His vision impairment 
and apparent seizure disorder were attributed to disease progression by the site PI (PI 
communication). 
Loes score  
15 subjects had assessments beyond Month 24, and 13 maintained a stable Loes score as of latest 
assessment in study.

Study ALD-103  
A Prospective and Retrospective Data Collection Study to Evaluate Outcomes in Males ≤17 Years of 
Age Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Cerebral 
Adrenoleukodystrophy 
The study started in 2015 and Last Subject Last Visit for Clinical Study Report was 06 December 2019 
Study conducted at multiple study centres: USA (5 sites), Germany (2 sites), UK (2 sites), Netherlands 
(2 sites), France (1 site), Italy (1 site), Spain (1 site), Argentina (1 site) 
Key eligibility criteria were male and ≤ 17 years of age and a confirmed diagnosis of CALD as defined 
by abnormal VLCFA profile and cerebral lesion on brain MRI. 
The following populations were evaluated for outcomes of allo-HSCT: 
• The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all subjects who initiated conditioning 
• The Transplant Population (TP): all subjects who received allo-HSCT 
Additionally, data were summarised for all allo-HSCT subjects who had Baseline characteristics similar 
to those of subjects treated in Study ALD-102. These populations are defined as follows: 
• Strictly ALD-102-Eligible Transplant Population (TPES), which includes subjects who received an allo-
HSC infusion and satisfied the following criteria: 
- 
NFS ≤1 at Baseline 
- 
0.5 ≤ Loes score ≤9 at Baseline 
- 
Gadolinium enhancement (GdE+) at Baseline 
• ALD-102-Eligible Transplant Population (TPE), which includes subjects who received an allo-HSC 
infusion and satisfied the following criteria: 
- 
NFS ≤ 1 at Baseline 
- 
Loes score ≤ 9 at Baseline 
- 
Loes score ≥ 0.5 or GdE+ at Baseline 
• GdE+ Transplant Population (TPG), which includes subjects who received an allo-HSC infusion and 
who were GdE+ at Baseline. 
In addition, certain safety and efficacy endpoints were summarised for the following subgroups: 
• Subgroups by donor type: subjects with a matched sibling donor (MSD), or without a matched 
sibling donor (NMSD) 
Efficacy endpoints were basically the same as for studies ALD-102 and 104 above.

Table 15 Summary of Key Patient Characteristics 
 
Overall, 82% had a myeloablative conditioning regime and 19% had a reduced intensity conditioning. 
The most commonly administered conditioning agents for allo-HSCT included busulfan (51 subjects; 
78%), cyclophosphamide (32 subjects; 49%), anti-thymocyte globulin (22 subjects; 34%), and 
alemtuzumab (17 subjects; 26%). Other conditioning agents were given in < 25% of subjects. 
Comparisons of Survival Between Untreated Versus Allo-HSCT Subjects 
There was a statistically significant association between treatment (Allo-HSCT yes/no) and Kaplan-
Meier estimated 5-year overall survival rate from CCALD diagnosis for all subjects (78% versus 55%, p 
= 0.0119), as well as for the subsets of subjects with progressive disease at baseline (i.e., baseline 
NFS > 1: 89% versus 25%, p = 0.0333; baseline GdE+: 84% versus 36%, p = 0.0015). However, 
allo-HSCT was not associated with significant improvement in estimated 5-year overall survival rates 
for subjects with early disease, nor in estimated 2-year overall survival rates in any subset analyzed, 
perhaps reflecting advances in nursing and rehabilitation care that has improved the short-term 
survival of severely sick patients with advanced CCALD. Nevertheless, results did suggest that 
analysing GdE+ subjects may increase the significance of any effect because GdE+ status is associated 
with rapidly progressive disease without treatment.

Table 16 Comparison of Kaplan-Meier Survival Estimates Between Untreated and HSCT 
Cohorts 
 
Kaplan-Meier analysis of MFD-free survival did not allow an earlier detection of efficacy of allo-HSCT 
treatment than did analysis of overall survival for all subjects with early disease at baseline (2-year 
MFD-free survival rates of 88% untreated versus 91% allo-HSCT treated, for subjects with baseline 
NFS ≤ 1 & Loes 0.5 to 9), presumably because many of these subjects had slowly progressing disease. 
However, it was anticipated that analysing the GdE+ subset of subjects with early disease would 
increase the significance of the analysis, as well as make it more clinically relevant, because allo-HSCT 
is currently standard of care for CCALD patients with early stage disease (NFS≤1 & Loes 0.5 to 9) and 
GdE+ status. Kaplan-Meier estimated 2-year MFD-free survival rates for subjects who fell into this 
category were 85% for allo-HSCT subjects (N=27, NFS ≤ 1, Loes between 0.5 and 9, and GdE+ before 
allo-HSCT) but it could not be meaningfully calculated in untreated group because of small sample size 
(N=1 GdE+ at CCALD diagnosis, N=3 GdE+ at any time). However, the Kaplan-Meier estimated 2-year 
MFD-free survival for all GdE+ untreated subjects regardless of baseline NFS and Loes scores was 
29%. Therefore, because the majority of GdE+ untreated subjects will have rapidly progressive 
disease, it is likely untreated subjects, if evaluated with sufficient frequency to detect GdE+ whilst still 
showing early disease, would also have low 2-year MFD-free survival rates.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The Transplant Population (TP), i.e. subjects who receive Lenti-D Drug Product in Study ALD-102 or 
Study ALD-104, and subjects who receive allo-HSCT in Studies ALD-101 and ALD-103, is abbreviated 
as TP-102, TP-104, TP-101, and TP-103, respectively.  
The Successful Neutrophil Engraftment Population (NEP) consists of subjects who achieved neutrophil 
engraftment defined as having 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil count (ANC) laboratory values of ≥ 
0.5 × 109 cells/L (after initial post-infusion nadir) obtained on different days by 42 days post-infusion 
of HSC. The NEP was used to compare hospitalisation after a successful NE from either Lenti-D Drug 
Product or allo-HSCT, only if the NEP is different from the TP. 
Three baseline parameters, NFS, Loes score, and gadolinium enhancement (GdE) status, are important 
prognostic factors for CALD disease progression in untreated patients. Therefore, efficacy and safety 
results in TP-102 and TP-104 were compared with populations in Studies ALD-101 and ALD-103 with 
“similar” baseline disease characteristics with respect to these three parameters.

Subgroups analyses were performed by donor category in subjects who received allo-HSCT. The 
categories included:  
• Subjects who have a matched sibling donor (MSD)  
• Subjects who do not have a matched sibling donor (NMSD).  
 
Statistical analysis methods for the inter-study comparisons were primarily descriptive in nature. In 
addition to the efficacy success criterion based on the proportion of subjects who achieved Month 24 
MFD-free survival in study ALD-102, a safety success criterion was defined for the inter-study 
comparisons.  
 
The safety success criterion was based on achieving a statistically significant reduction in the 
proportion of subjects who experienced either acute GVHD (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD in TP-102 
compared to TP-103 (p<0.05). Evaluable subjects for this analysis were those who received HSCI in 
Studies ALD-102 (TP-102) and ALD-103 (TP-103) who experienced either ≥ Grade II acute GVHD or 
chronic GVHD within 24 months post any HSCI or have been followed for at least 12 months after the 
latest HSCI. Subjects who experienced either ≥ Grade II acute GVHD or chronic GVHD within 24 
months post any HSCI were considered failures for this endpoint. The Fisher’s exact test was used for 
comparisons of the proportions. For all other comparisons, p-values were provided as descriptive 
measures. As one of the sensitivity analyses, the time to the first acute GVHD (≥ Grade II) or chronic 
GVHD was compared between TP-102 and the other analysis populations using competing risk analysis 
with engraftment failure (primary and secondary), transplant related mortality and death from other 
causes as competing risks. The cause-specific hazard model was used for the analysis.  
 
The number and percentage of subjects who achieved Month 24 MFD-free survival as well as the two-
sided exact 95% CI was presented. P-values for comparisons with TP-102 were obtained using Fisher’s 
exact test. To be considered a success for Month 24 MFD-free survival, a subject must meet all 
following criteria:  
1. Be alive 24 months post first HSCI.  
2. Have not developed any of the MFDs by 24 months post first HSCI.  
3. Have not received rescue cell administration or subsequent allo-HSCT by 24 months post 
first HSCI.  
4. Have not withdrawn from the study (for reasons other than study termination) or lost to 
follow-up by 24 months post first HSCI.  
This definition of MFD-free survival was different from the definition used in the CSR of Study ALD-101, 
where failure was defined as either having MFD or death by Month 24. Moreover, a wider window (-6 
to +6 months) was allowed for Study ALD-101 to accommodate the unscheduled nature of data 
collection in this retrospective study, so that failures by Month 30 were included in this analysis for 
ALD-101. 
 
MFD-free Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Death, MFD, and rescue cell 
administration or subsequent allo-HSCT were considered events; for all studies except ALD-101, 
subjects who did not experience any event were censored at their date of last contact (DLC). Due to 
the limited AE/SAE collection in ALD-101, subjects who did not experience any event in ALD-101 were 
censored at their last NFS assessment. The following results were to be presented:  
- 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles of event-free subjects with 
associated two-sided 95% CIs  
- 
Number and percentage of events and censored observations

Demographics 
For the ALD-102 study the median age at eli-cel treatment was 6.0 (4, 14) years and in the 
corresponding subpopulations (TPES) of the ALD-103 and ALD-101 studies, the median age was 8.0 
(4,14) at first allo-HSCT.

Kaplan-Meier Estimated MFD-free Survival: (TP-102, TPES-103) 
MFD-free survival was analyzed by Kaplan Meier analyses for several subpopulations. Comparisons of 
the Kaplan Meier analysis for TP-102 to TPES-103 are presented in Table and Figure below. MFD-free 
survival was also analyzed by allo-HSCT donor category and compared to TP-102. 
The estimated MFD-free survival rate 36 months after allo-HSCT for TPES-103 was 63.2% (95% CI: 
38.2, 80.4) compared to 90.3% (95% CI: 72.9, 96.8) for TP-102. While subjects in TP‑102 failed this 
endpoint due to MFD development (1/32 subjects, 3.1%) and second HSC infusion (2/32 subjects, 
6.3%, due to Investigator decisions), subjects in the TPES-103 failed due to death (3/27 subjects, 
11.1%: 1 due to GVHD, 1 due to cardiac arrest, and 1 due to septic shock) and second allo-HSCT 
(5/27 subjects, 18.5%, due to primary or secondary graft rejection). Thus, the main reasons for failure 
in the TPES-103 population are related to immuno‑incompatibility between donor and recipient. 
Notably, while the rate of MFD-free survival is stable over time by approximately 18 months after eli-
cel infusion for TP-102, TPES-103 has a decrease in survival rate after this time point, indicating that 
while most events do occur in the first 18 months after allo-HSCT, there are still some events that 
occur at later time points. This is consistent with results reported in the literature for allo-HSCT. 
Overall, the hazard ratio of 0.261 [95% CI: 0.069, 0.986]), suggests that eli-cel reduces the risk of 
failing the MFD-free survival endpoint by up to 73.9% compared to allo-HSCT treated subjects in TPES-
103. 
When TP-102 was compared to subgroups separated by donor type, it was observed that MFD‑free 
survival rate 36 months after HSC infusion for the TP-102 showed a trend to be higher than TPES-103-

MSD subjects, and is higher than TPES-103-NMSD subjects (Table 11). Overall, based on observed 
hazard ratios of 0.519 (95%CI: 0.086, 3.124) and 0.187 (95% CI: 0.046, 0.757), TP-102 reduces the 
risk of failing the MFD-free survival endpoint by 48.1% and 81.3% compared to MSD and NMSD 
subjects in TPES-103, respectively. 
These findings suggest that treatment with eli-cel confers improved MFD-free survival over time when 
compared to that of subjects receiving allo-HSCT who have the same Baseline disease characteristics. 
This difference is mainly due to events in the TPES subgroups associated with immuno-incompatibility 
between donor and recipient.

a Evaluable subjects are subjects who have completed the Month 24 Visit GdE assessment. 
All subjects with the same Baseline disease characteristics (i.e., TPES-103) as TP-102 who had 
completed at least their Month 6 Visit became GdE- at some time after allo-HSCT. One subject in this 
population experienced re-emergence of GdE+ at their Month 12 Visit, but was reported to be GdE- at 
all other visits, thus 100% (exact 95% CI: 75.3, 100) TPES-103 subjects were GdE- at Month 24. This 
proportion of GdE- at Month 24 is higher than what was reported for TP-102 (81.0% [exact 95% CI: 
58.1, 94.6]), but confidence intervals are overlapping.

Performance IQ data for TPES-103 subjects are sparse, which hinders comparisons, but of the subjects 
with Baseline PrIQ and at least 1 additional assessment post allo-HSCT, most appear to have minimal 
changes in Performance IQ which are stabilised by Month 24.

Median Performance IQ in TP-102 stayed within the normal range with only a small decline over time, 
and the results appear similar between TP-102 and TPES-103. Generally, median values stayed near 
Baseline. There is more variability in the median Performance IQ over time for TPES-103, presumably 
due to the smaller number of subjects; the median Performance IQ dips below the normal range at 
Month 36, but otherwise also remains within the normal range.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The indication applied for is: ‘Skysona is indicated for the treatment of early cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for 
whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not 
available (see section 5.1).’  
 
The proposed indication is agreed upon. 
It is concluded that although all patients in the clinical studies were males, a gender-neutral indication 
text is preferred to allow treatment also in rare cases of female childhood CALD patients. The SmPC 
includes the information in section 4.2 that female paediatric patients have not been included in the 
clinical studies.  
In support of this indication, efficacy results from one pivotal study (ALD-102, N=32) and one ongoing 
long-term follow-up study (LTF-304) with subjects with CALD treated with eli-cel have been submitted. 
In addition, a second treatment study ALD-104 is ongoing but hadn’t reached the cut-off timepoint for 
the primary efficacy endpoint at the time of approval.

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 92/136 
 
As historical control groups, the retrospective study ALD-101 contains both untreated boys and boys 
treated with allo-HSCT and study ALD-103 is a contemporaneous study with boys treated with allo-
HSCT. For long-term follow up of efficacy and safety, the ongoing LTF-304 study will contain all boys 
who were treated with eli-cel in the clinical studies. A planned registry will enrol boys treated with eli-
cel post-approval or allo-HSCT. 
Single-arm design of the studies with no comparator is an important limitation of the clinical 
development programme. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a 
therapeutic option that can stabilise progression of CALD, with the best outcomes observed if it is 
performed at the early stages of cerebral involvement. The severity of the disease, the rarity of the 
disease, the limitations of treatment options, the inability of transplant to be blinded, and the potential 
impact of time required to identify a donor match on cerebral disease progression precluded the 
conduct of a randomised controlled trial in the target patient population, this is acceptable and agreed 
during scientific advice given. 
Dose-response 
No dose-response studies have been performed, which is acceptable given the rarity and severity of 
the disease.  
The applicant states that the minimum proposed dose of ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg eli-cel is the 
minimal dose that has been reported to lead to optimal neutrophil and platelet engraftment. 
Furthermore, there are no maximal recommended dose of CD34+ cells for infusion and no AEs related 
to high CD34+ cell doses have been reported in the literature. However, in line with Zynteglo, the 
Skysona SmPC 4.2 states that ‘In clinical studies doses up to 38.2 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg have been 
administered’. This is supported. 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
 
Pivotal study ALD-102 
The main inclusion criteria were male 17 and younger with active CALD defined by elevated VLCFA 
values, Loes scores 0.5 to 9 on MRI, GdE+, NFS≤1. It is noted that a genetic diagnosis of ALD was not 
included in the inclusion criteria. However, the demographics data on individual subjects confirm that a 
genetic diagnosis based on detection of an ABCD1 gene mutation had been performed for all included 
subjects. The genetic diagnosis is also included in the proposed Indication text, which is endorsed. The 
inclusion criteria related to early disease (Loes score, GdE+ and NFS) reflect the experience from allo-
HSCT treatment of early CALD and are acknowledged. 
Main exclusion criterion was availability of a willing 10/10 HLA-matched sibling donor. This exclusion 
criterion is reflected in the last sentence of the proposed Indication: “…for whom a human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not available”. 
The applicant states that the conditioning regimen used in this study, busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 
is a standard regimen used in allo-HSCT for CALD to achieve myeloablation and immunosuppression. 
The conditioning regimen is described in SmPC section 5.1. 
The success criterion for study ALD-102 comparison to a clinically meaningful benchmark, has been 
accepted at scientific advice given. The efficacy results are also compared to the untreated cohort in 
ALD-101 and the allo-HSCT treated cohorts of studies ALD-101 and ALD-103. 
The major endpoints MFD-free survival, NFS, Loes score have been specifically developed for CALD 
studies to represent outcomes that are clinically relevant in this condition. The selection of endpoints is 
in accordance with published results from successful trials using allo-HSCT to treat CALD. The primary 
and secondary endpoints were accepted in the EMA Central Scientific advice of 2018.

Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 93/136 
 
The study was not dimensioned on a formal power calculation, which is acceptable for a study in this 
limited patient population in a rare disease. Success criterion was defined based on a comparison of 
the primary efficacy endpoint (Month 24 MFD-free survival rate) to a clinically meaningful benchmark 
of 50%, which was agreed in the protocol assistance procedure. 
The sample size was increased 3 times during the study. The applicant explains the amended sample 
size was needed in order to obtain study data on the investigational product from European 
manufacturing sites. Listing 16.1.6 in the submission for the study ALD-102 shows subjects receiving 
the investigational product from 3 specific manufacturing sites. 
Statistical methodology applied was appropriate given the simple study design. Analysing only 
observed cases of success in Month-24 MFD-free survival, with no received rescue cell administration 
or allo-HSCT, is endorsed. Analysis of the primary endpoint based on the TP population instead of the 
ITT is not supported in principle in this condition, however this is not of concern for the prespecified 
primary analysis as the TP and ITT population are the same. Presentation of the four MFD-free survival 
criteria is complemented by subject listing of individual major functional disabilities. Comparison of the 
primary endpoint with the clinically meaningful benchmark of 50% has previously been accepted by 
the CHMP. 
It is acknowledged that the primary analysis is performed as prespecified, based on the initially 
planned sample size, although 17 subjects were enrolled in the study instead of 15 originally planned.  
Selection of GVHD at Month 24 as the primary safety endpoint is redundant due to necessity of a 
holistic approach in evaluation of the safety data. In addition to the analysis of proportions, time to 
GVHD was analysed in the inter-study comparisons. 
Changes from the analysis planned in the study protocol were presented in the SAP but not changes 
between the SAP versions. There is no indication that the changes in the planned analysis were not 
data driven. The limitations of the study design pertained to the small sample size, no concurrent 
comparator arm, and selection of the primary efficacy endpoint designed for the study (i.e. with no 
adequate prior validation). Several of the methodological limitations are associated with general 
difficulties to design and conduct studies in rare patient populations with few or inadequate treatment 
options as is the case with CALD. In the primary efficacy analysis, subjects who discontinued prior to 
the Month 24 visit were considered treatment failures; however, the secondary endpoints were 
analysed based on non-missing values which violates the ITT principle and may bias the results. The 
impact of missing data on the study results was investigated in sensitivity analyses that showed similar 
trends as seen in the initial analysis performed on non-missing observations (see section on interstudy 
comparisons).  
In study ALD-102, the issue of multiplicity has been avoided by limiting the primary analysis to the 
initial cohort instead of including the entire study population, which may be acceptable given the 
results for the overall cohort, and the confidence interval approach of the analysis (i.e. comparison to a 
fixed benchmark). However, no multiplicity adjustments were made in the inter-study comparisons 
which allows the interpretation of the results for descriptive purpose only. An implication is that the 
selection of the endpoints presented in the SmPC section 5.1 has not been based on statistical grounds 
but is driven by the obtained results and their clinical relevance.  
Baseline 
Median age at enrolment into study was 6 years and age span was 3-13 years in the transplant 
population. The majority of patients were 2-12 years and only 1 subject in each cohort was 13 years 
old at baseline. The age span at eli-cel infusion was 4-14.

EMA/332184/2021  
Page 94/136 
 
Regarding the age span in the indication; there is experience with younger children (0-3 years) 
undergoing apheresis and conditioning from autologous and allogenous HSCT. Experience from allo-
HSCT of CALD support the extrapolation of data to patients aged less than 3 years. No dose 
adjustment is needed for patients aged less than 3 years. The applicant has clarified that since CALD is 
detected based on radiologic signs of demyelination and normally, the myelination in the brain is not 
complete until the age of 12 months at the earliest, this is the earliest timepoint for a screening brain 
MRI as part of the diagnostic workup for CALD. NFS may be assessed from the age of 18 months. The 
Committee considers that the diagnosis of CALD will provide a limit of the lower age at treatment and 
no lower age limit is therefore needed in the Indication text.  
Regarding the extrapolation from males to females; the Committee found evidence of very rare cases 
of female patients with cerebral symptoms of ALD with onset during childhood (Haas et al: Neonatal‐
onset adrenoleukodystrophy in a girl, Neonatal‐onset adrenoleukodystrophy in a girl, Ann Neurology, 
1982;12(5):449-457, and Lourenco et al, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in heterozygous female 
patients: women are not just carriers, Arq Neuropsiquiatr 2012;70(7):487-491. Thus, CAT considers 
that the treatment with Skysona should not be restricted to males and that female childhood CALD 
patients should be included in the indication text. 
At baseline, only 1 of 32 patients had NFS 1, and 31/32 had NFS 0. The median Loes score at baseline 
was 2 with a range of 1-9. The median time from informed consent to eli-cel infusion was 67 days 
(span 58-89 days). 
It is acknowledged that the ITT, TP and NEP populations are identical, and that the efficacy analysis 
therefore follows the ITT approach. 
Efficacy results 
The success criterion for the initial cohort of 17 patients was met. 15/17 (88.2 %, 95% CI 63.6, 98.5) 
of treated subjects met the primary endpoint of Month 24 MFD-free survival. Since the lower bound of 
the confidence interval (63.6%) was above the threshold of 50%, the study efficacy success criterion 
was met. The overall cohort showed similar results with 20/23 or 87.0% (95% CI: 66.4, 97.2) of 
treated subjects meeting the primary endpoint of Month 24 MFD-free survival with the lower bound of 
CI being 66.4%. This indicates that treatment with eli-cel is better than no treatment. 
The secondary endpoints MFD-free survival over time and overall survival (1 subject died at month 22) 
didn’t add any important information to the results from the primary endpoint.  
The secondary endpoint resolution of gadolinium contrast enhancement at month 24, as considered 
possibly reflective of resolution of neuroinflammation, revealed somewhat conflicting results. Sixteen of 
21 (76.2%) subjects had sustained GdE- by Month 24 with the median time to first GdE- for those who 
achieved sustained GdE- was 45 (29-551) days. On the other hand, an additional 5 subjects displayed 
re-emergence of GdE+ at some MRIs between month 6 and 24. The clinical significance of re-
emergence of GdE+ is not known, but may be related to repair of the blood-brain barrier or 
remyelination, as has been seen in other similar conditions, e.g. MS. There was no association between 
GdE status and clinical outcome in this study. 
Twenty out of 23 (87%) of evaluable subjects had an NFS of 0 at month 24 and 2/23 had an NFS of 1 
(episodes of incontinence, visual impairment). The subject who died from disease progression had an 
NFS of 17 at the last assessment.  
Sixteen out of 21 subjects who were evaluable had a stable Loes score at month 24, defined as ≤9 or 
≤6 points increase from baseline. 10/21 had a change of ≤1. Of all 32 subjects, 9/32 didn’t have a 
stable Loes score at their last assessment before data cut-off. The few (n=4) subjects with a baseline 
Loes score ≥ 4.5 had a greater worsening of Loes score (+7.5, vs +1.0) and Performance IQ (-23 vs -

Page 95/136 
 
2.5) from baseline to month 24 than subjects with a baseline Loes score of <4.5 (n=28). Baseline Loes 
<4.5 seems to be predictor of better outcomes (month 24 MFD-free survival 93%, overall survival 
100%, stable NFS 100%, no changes in NFS for 92%, stable Loes score 87%). This confirms the data 
from Pierpont et al. (2017) on similar differences for allo-HSCT treated CALD subjects. To inform the 
treating physicians on the less favourable outcome in patients with a higher baseline Loew score, the 
following sentence has been added to SmPC section 5.1: ‘A small subgroup of patients who had higher 
Loes scores at baseline tended to have a less favourable outcome.’ 
Performance IQ, an exploratory endpoint, was chosen as the main IQ result, since all patients did not 
have English as their native language and the performance IQ test overcomes such difficulties better 
than other parts of the full IQ test. This strategy is accepted. Data are presented for Performance IQ 
for all subjects in ALD-102 as individual plots over time. It appears from these plots that most subjects 
remained within the normal IQ range of 100 ± 15 points (i.e. 85-115 points). This is in line with what 
is seen after allo-HSCT. A few subjects (n=2) had a baseline IQ below 70 and stayed below 70 after 
treatment. A few (n=2) had a baseline IQ of above 70 and decreased below 70 after treatment. A 
persistent decrease in IQ down to <70 (i.e. cut-off for intellectual disability) may be regarded as a 
significant change in cognitive function. The outcome data on IQ adds granularity to the primary 
endpoint MFD-free survival and supportive outcome measures such as NFS and Loes score by 
providing measures of cognitive function.  
As expected, patients who had a Loes score above 9 at any timepoint deteriorated to a greater extent 
in their IQ during follow-up than those whose Loes stayed below 9. In comparison, subjects in TPES-
103 didn’t provide much longitudinal performance IQ data. Only 8 of 20 subjects provided IQ data for 
24 months or longer. Among these few patients, performance IQ tended to be rather stable over time. 
Similar graphs as were observed for performance IQ were shown for full IQ. In addition, the applicant 
has compared the in-house IQ data with IQ data from Pierpont et al. (2017), and their conclusion is 
that a similar trend towards some decline in IQ after allo-HSCT is seen as seen after eli-cel treatment.  
Furthermore, the applicant has provided data from the Vineland II Adaptive Behavior Composite 
(VABS), which assesses adaptive behaviour in 4 domains: Communication, ADL, socialisation, motor 
skills with a mean composite score of 100 ± 15 (standard deviation). The VABS is normally used to 
measure adaptive behaviour to support the diagnosis of intellectual and developmental disabilities, 
autism, and developmental delays. This test reflects everyday functioning and was recorded for up to 
month 24 in the ALD-102 study. No VABS scores were collected in study ALD-103. VABS scores were 
more stable over time than IQ scores and here it was more obvious that particularly the subjects with 
Loes >9 at any timepoint deteriorated in VABS during the 24 months follow up after gene therapy but 
not the subjects with Loes below 9 during follow-up. The fairly stable VABS results over time indicate 
that these children manage their everyday life without much signs of developmental delay or autistic 
behaviour.  
The PedsQL with its subdomains physical, emotional, social, and school functioning are presented both 
for ALD-102/LTF-304 and TPES-103. However, it appears that these results show a great variability 
both between subjects and in individual subjects over time, which makes any interpretation difficult. 
The applicant has performed correlation analyses between Loees score changes and neuropsychological 
data, and PK/PD parameters and neuropsychological data. Negative correlations was seen between 
Loes score change from baseline and the two neuropsychological scores Performance IQ change from 
baseline and (correlation coefficient=-0.55, P=0.0014) and PedsQL change from baseline (correlation 
coefficient=-0.53, P=0.0030), but not between Loes score change and Full IQ change. For 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic markers and neuropsychological parameters, no correlations were 
seen, neither between total cell dose, median peripheral blood (PB) VCN, nor median PB %ALDP+ cells 
and the neuropsychological parameters full IQ, performance IQ and PedsQL.

EMA/332184/2021  
Page 96/136 
 
In addition, no correlation was seen between age at treatment and change from baseline of the three 
neuropsychological parameters. 
There was no apparent difference between drug product dose and VCN, age and Month 6 PD data for 
the 7 subjects with a Loes score >9 during the study and the whole study population, in these 7 
subjects, mean eli-cel dose was 11.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, mean eli-cel VCN 0.94 c/dg, mean age 6.6 
years, mean month 6 peripheral blood VCN 0.47 c/dg, mean peripheral blood ALDP+ 13.2%. 
Pediatric Quality of Life inventory generally showed a slight decrease from baseline to month 24, 
mainly driven by psychosocial health and emotional functioning. 
Taken together, the primary endpoint MFD-free survival is supported by secondary and exploratory 
endpoints reflective of radiological signs of neuroinflammation and demyelinisation (GdE and Loes) and 
neurological function (NFS). These results show that treatment with eli-cel resulted in a clinically 
relevant stabilisation of disease by month 24. It is also noted that a limited number (N=23) of subjects 
have contributed to the primary endpoint Month 24 timepoint MFD-free survival at the time of the data 
cut-off for the MAA. In their response to questions, the applicant has provided data from a later cut-off 
(Q4 2020) with N=30 subjects having reached the timepoint for the Month 24 primary endpoint. At 
this data cut-off, the proportion of (90%) MFD-free survival was 90% (27/30, 95% CI 73.5, 97.9).  
The applicant plans to capture neurocognitive function and school/work-life performance in the planned 
registry study REG-502, when these have been assessed as part of the standard of care of these 
children. Since the planned REG-502 study is a non-interventional study, these assessments cannot be 
required per protocol. 
Supportive study ALD-104 
Study ALD-104 started in Jan 2019, has treated 13 subjects, of which 7 have reached month 6 at the 
data cut-off 21 Feb 2020. However, no efficacy results have been presented from this interim analysis, 
only PD data up to month 6, which are presented in the PD section. 
It is noted that study ALD-104 used a different conditioning treatment than study ALD-102, i.e. 
fludrabine instead of cyclofosfamide in addition to busulfan. With respect to efficacy, the applicant has 
provided preliminary efficacy results for study ALD-104 from a later data cut-off (autumn 2020), 
showing among the 19 patients treated so far no deaths, no MFDs and neither any study withdrawals 
nor rescue cell administration or rescue treatment with allo-HSCT in early follow-up (0-15 months). 
The efficacy and safety data for the busulfan + fludarabine conditioning regimen are currently 
insufficient for a full B/R evaluation. However, it is agreed that the safety data generated for eli-cel in 
combination with this regimen should be reflected in the SmPC. 
Long-term follow-up study LTF-304 
From the ongoing long-term follow-up study LTF-304, efficacy data from the first 21 subjects enrolled 
showed that efficacy was generally maintained during the currently reported follow-up period of 56.4 
(22.1, 70.7) months. In LTF-304, no subjects had developed MFDs or died. Three subjects had a 
resolution of their GdE+ whereas 1 subject developed GdE+, 3 subjects had increased their NFS by 1 
point, Loes score was generally stable over time beyond Month 24. For IQ data, please see study ALD-
102 above. 
Concurrent historical control study ALD-103 with allo-HSCT 
Study ALD-103 was a retrospective and prospective concurrently run study to collect data on subjects 
treated with allo-HSCT for CALD. From the overall study population, the TPES subgroup was defined, 
which had the same eligibility criteria as the pivotal study ALD-102. Conditioning with the regimen 
Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide regimen appeared somewhat inferior to the Busulfan and Fludarabine

Page 97/136 
 
regimen (month 24 MFD-free survival: 64.7% vs 72.7%). A baseline Loes score above 9 was a clear 
prospective marker of treatment failure vs ≤9 (month 24 MFD-free survival: 33.3% vs 70.6%).   
Retrospective historical control study ALD-101: Untreated and allo-HSCT treated subjects 
The retrospective ALD-101 study collected data between 2011 and 2012, mainly from American 
centres. According to the protocol eligibility criteria patients were to be 3-15 years of age, inclusive, 
have increased VLCFA levels, a confirmed ABCD1 gene mutation or both and a Loes score of 0-15. 
They were to have a follow-up time for at least 2 years or until death, if earlier. The median age at 
baseline was the same for the untreated and allo-HSCT-treated cohorts, 8.0 years. More patients in the 
untreated cohort had baseline NFS of >1 (53% vs 25%) and slightly more had a Loes score of >9 
(39% vs 31%). 
Age span at CALD diagnosis was 2-15 in the untreated cohort, and 1-13 in the allo-HSCT cohort. Since 
CALD in uncommon cases has been diagnosed at the age of 1, and treatment should be started as 
early as possible after CALD diagnosis, a lower age cut-off appears non-appropriate. It should also be 
noted that the age at treatment was 2-18 in the allo-HSCT cohort.  
The overall 5-year survival from CALD diagnosis was 55% (N=72) in the untreated cohort vs 78% 
(N=65) in the allo-HSCT-treated cohort (p=0.0119). The comparison of 5-year survival or 2-year MSD-
free survival between the two cohorts was hampered by the fact that the inclusion criteria didn’t 
restrict the patient population to those with NFS ≤1, Loes score 0.5 to ≤9 and GdE+. When all these 
criteria were applied to the untreated cohort, the resulting subgroup was too small to enable any 
meaningful comparison. However, in the untreated cohort, it is clear from the data that GdE+ at 
baseline was a negative factor for 5-year survival (36%, N=15 vs 84% N=45 in allo-HSCT cohort, 
p=0.0015) and GdE+ at any time was an equally negative factor for 2-year MSD-free survival (29%, 
N=21). Likewise, a more advanced disease, as shown by NFS>1 at baseline had a negative impact on 
5-year overall survival of 25% (N=27) in the untreated cohort vs 89% (N=9) in the allo-HSCT cohort.  
Interstudy comparison between studies ALD-102, 103 and 101 
In the interstudy comparison between studies ALD-102, 103 and 101, the age at first HSCT treatment 
was similar and so were baseline disease characteristics between ALD-102 and the corresponding TPES 
subgroups of studies ALD-103 and ALD-101.   
Regarding the possible recruitment bias in terms of overlapping sites between studies ALD-102 and 
ALD-103, the applicant has explained that there were 4 sites recruiting for both studies and 2 of them 
recruited for ALD-103 while ALD-102 recruitment was active. These could be explained by pre-planned 
procedures. In general, sites preferred enrolling for ALD-102 only as long as recruitment was active 
which could create a bias for more positive outcomes in ALD-102. However, these two sites did only 
recruit for 1 study at a time.  
Regarding the primary endpoint Month 24 MFD-free survival, the result in study ALD-102 of 87.0% 
(95% CI 66.4, 97.2) was in line with that of matched sibling donors in the TPES-103 population 
(88.9% (95% CI 51.8, 99.7), whereas the non-matched sibling donor subpopulation in TPES-103 
showed a numerically worse result of 66.7% (95% CI 22.9, 92.5).  
However, in the completed studies ALD-103 and ALD-101, only 67 % (18 of 27) and 77% (20 of 26) of 
subjects, respectively, strictly matched to the ALD-102 population, were evaluable for Month 24 MFD 
survival. Similarly, numbers of subjects evaluable for the analysis of NFS, Loes score and GdE status, 
are in most cases, in all submitted studies, based on the non-missing observations. The applicant 
explained the low evaluability numbers for the Month 24 MFD-free survival by the prespecified study-
specific definitions of the evaluable population. However, the study specific definitions were not 
following the ITT principle, which is the reason for requesting sensitivity analyses. The applicant

therefore considered the most conservative approach to sensitivity analysis by counting non-evaluable 
subjects in TP-102 as having a negative outcome, while missing data for TPES-101 and TPES-103 were 
imputed as a success for the selected primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. The sensitivity 
analysis using the most conservative imputation approach did not change the conclusions on the main 
analysis for these parameters performed on non-missing observations. However, it was seen that the 
effect estimates are sensitive and prone to bias with increasing rate of missing data and should be 
interpreted cautiously. Another (supplementary) analysis was performed using parameters at the last 
available assessment instead of imputing missing data. The interpretation of the supplementary 
analysis is however questionable due to varying follow-up. 
In study ALD-102, MFD-free survival was stable over time after Month 24, whereas it was further 
decreased in subjects treated with allo-HSCT in study ALD-103, in which it stabilised only from Month 
36. Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimated Month 36 MFD-free survival was 90.3% (95% CI: 72.9, 96.8) in 
ALD-102/LTF-304 vs 74.1% (28.9, 93.0) for the TPES-103 MSD subgroup and 58.8% (27.5, 80.4) for 
the TPES-103 NMSD subgroup. For patients treated with eli-cel, the most relevant comparison is with 
the TPES-103 MSD subgroup when it comes to comparing with the currently overall best available 
treatment. The comparison with the TPES-103 NMSD subgroup demonstrates the currently available 
best treatment option for the subgroup (70%) of CALD patients with no available HLA-matched sibling 
donor, such as defined in the Indication for Skysona. The worse MFD-free survival at month 36 in the 
allo-HSCT subgroups were related to immuno‑incompatibility between donor and recipient, i.e. GvHD 
and second allo-HSCT due to graft rejection, and not to development of MFDs, i.e. disease progression, 
in the subjects. 
Similar results were shown for NFS, with stable NFS at Month 24 (defined as maintaining a NFS <=4 
without an increase of >3 points from Baseline) being 95.7% (95% CI 78.1, 99.9) versus 100% (73.5, 
100.0) and 100% (71.5, 100.0) for the ALD-102, 103 and 101 studies, respectively. 
However, a lower proportion (76.2%, 95% CI 52.8, 91.8) of boys in the ALD-102 study showed stable 
Loes score at month 24 compared to the TPES-103 of 92.3% (95% CI 64.0, 99.8), whereas in the 
TPES-101 subgroup these results were even worse (64.7%, 95% CI 38.3, 85.8). In the pooled TPES 
101/103 subgroup they were similar (76.7%, 95% CI 57.7, 90.1), indicative of no true difference 
between eli-cel and allo-HSCT-treated groups.  
Similarly, fewer patients in ALD-102 were GdE- at month 24 (81.0%, 95% CI 58.1, 94.6) compared to 
TPES-103 (100%, 95% CI 75.3, 100.0) and TPES-101 (100%, 95% CI 85.8, 100.0). Comparisons 
between the individual studies also showed that more subjects were GdE+ over the months after eli-
cel treatment than after treatment with allo-HSCT in ALD-103. These results may indicate a slightly 
inferior effect on neuroinflammation by eli-cel treatment compared to allo-HSCT. This from an efficacy 
perspective, supports the restriction in the indication to boys for whom an HLA-matched sibling donor 
is not available, as reflected in the indication, until longer-term data on maintenance of efficacy and 
cognitive function is available. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Treatment with eli-cel (Skysona) of 4-14 years old boys diagnosed with CALD has been shown to be 
superior with regards to MFD-free survival compared to no treatment in a retrospective untreated 
CALD historical cohort and similar in efficacy in comparison to allo-HSCT treated retrospective and 
contemporaneous cohorts, especially similar efficacy was shown for Skysona and those subjects 
treated with allo-HSCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor. In comparison to subjects who received 
allo-HSCT from a non-matched donor, which currently is the available treatment option for the around 
70% of the CALD boys, the MFD-free survival for eli-cel appears slightly superior.

In addition, comprehensive data from neuropsychological test results including age-appropriate 
Wechsler IQ test results, Vineland II Adaptive Behavior Scale Score (VABS) and Pediatric quality of life 
inventory (PedsQL) are available, supporting a stabilisation of cognitive function in the majority of 
children. The data have been supplemented with data from a later cut-off for the three clinical studies, 
confirming the results from the initial submission data cut-off. 
The efficacy data is therefore considered appropriate to conclude on a positive B/R balance for the 
sought indication. However, the additional data collected post authorisation in the ongoing Study LTF-
304 will be of value since the maintenance of efficacy over longer time than 60-80 months is currently 
unknown.    
The CAT considered the following measure necessary to inform further on the long-term efficacy of the 
product:  
In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Skysona in patients with cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), the MAH should submit final results of Study LTF-304.  
In order to further characterise the long-term safety and efficacy, the MAH should conduct, and submit 
the results of a prospective observational Registry Study of patients with CALD treated with Skysona or 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Stargazer; REG-502.) 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
2.6.1.  Clinical safety 
Three clinical studies contributed safety information on Skysona: Studies ALD-102 (ongoing, interim 
data cut: 17 January 2020), ALD-104 (ongoing, interim data cut: 21 February 2020), and the long-
term follow-up Study LTF-304 (ongoing, interim data cut: 31 January 2020). See Table ‘Overview of 
clinical studies’ in Section 3.3.5. 
The applicant provided updated data in response to the Day 102 LoQ (Studies ALD-102 (ongoing, data 
cut: 23 October 2020), ALD-104 (ongoing, data cut: 09 October 2020), and the long-term follow-up 
Study LTF-304 (ongoing, data cut: 02 November 2020). In addition, late-breaking safety information 
was provided up to 05 February 2021. 
Subjects in both parent studies ALD-102 and ALD-104 were eligible to enrol in study LTF-304 upon the 
completion of the Month 24 Visit of their respective study and were to be followed for an additional 13 
years under the separate follow-up protocol LTF-304. At the time of the interim analysis, 21 subjects 
from ALD-102 had enrolled in Study LFT-304 and no subjects from ALD-104. As of the current cut 
dates, 25 subjects from ALD-102 are enrolled. 
Two studies using allo-HSCT provided contextual safety data; Study ALD-103 is a completed 
prospective and retrospective data collection study of allo-HSCT. Study ALD-101 is a completed 
retrospective non-interventional data collection study of subjects either untreated or treated with allo-
HSCT. Adverse event comparisons to allo-HSCT were mainly made with ALD-103. The Transplant 
Population (TP) consisted of subjects who received a Skysona infusion or allo-HSCT in each study. 
Patient exposure 
The TP-population for the combined studies ALD-102 and 104 (TP-102/104) included 45 subjects who 
were enrolled and treated in Studies ALD-102 (32 subjects) and ALD-104 (13 subjects), respectively. 
Safety data on 6 additional ALD-104 subjects were provided at the Day 120 update.

All subjects treated with Skysona underwent myeloablation with busulfan and lymphodepletion with 
either cyclophosphamide (Study ALD-102) or fludarabine (Study ALD-104).  
All treated subjects received a single lot of Skysona with a dose of ≥ 5.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg and 
met the minimum cell dose requirement per protocol. 
Twenty-five subjects from Study ALD-102 continue to participate in the ongoing Study LTF 304 as of 
the 02 November 2020 data cut date; 1 subject discontinued after approximately 54 months of follow-
up (subject declined further follow-up). The median total duration of follow-up of the ALD-102 and LFT-
304 studies combined is 38.59 (13.4, 82.7) months. 
In Study ALD-103, subjects were exposed to a variety of conditioning regimens according to 
institutional guidelines, including busulfan (96.6%) with either cyclophosphamide (47.5%) or 
fludarabine (64.4%) for lymphodepletion. In addition, some subjects received other conditioning 
agents such as anti-thymocyte globulin (47.5%) and/or alemtuzumab (23.7%). Nine of 59 (15.3%) 
subjects in Study ALD-103 required a second allo-HSCT; 1 of these subjects subsequently underwent a 
third allo-HSCT. Subjects in TP-103 had a median (min, max) follow-up time of 23.0 (0.9, 49.5) 
months. 
Adverse events 
The timing and strategy of AE collection for Studies ALD-102/ALD-104 and LTF-304, as well as for 
Study ALD-103, are shown in the figure below. Rel Day was defined such that “Rel Day 1 (or Day 1)” 
was the day of Skysona infusion. 
 
Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as AEs starting during or after the first HSCI (i.e, Rel Day 1).  
Safety comparisons to ALD-103 were limited to the following: ≥ Grade 3 AEs; ≥Grade 3 AEs related to 
HSCI; and SAEs. Non-clinically significant laboratory AEs and haematological toxicities related to 
conditioning medication for first 30 days after any allo-HSC infusion were not collected.  
Neutrophil engraftment (NE) was defined as 3 consecutive absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 0.5 × 
109/L (after initial post-infusion nadir) obtained on different days by 42 days post-HSCT (Rel Day 43). 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
Skysona - Assessment report  
EMA/332184/2021  
Page 101/136 
 
Platelet engraftment (PE) was defined as 3 consecutive platelet counts ≥ 20 × 109cells/L obtained on 
different days while no platelet transfusions were administered for 7 days immediately preceding and 
during the evaluation period.  
No primary or secondary NE failure was observed in evaluable TP-102/104 subjects. Two subjects from 
Study ALD-104 were considered unevaluable for NE because they had not yet achieved NE or been 
followed until at least Rel Day 43. 
Primary or secondary NE failure was experienced by 10/38 (26.3%) evaluable subjects by Month 24 in 
TP-103, all of whom were NMSD subjects. Six of these subjects had primary engraftment failure and 4 
subjects had secondary engraftment failure. Nine of these subjects went on to receive second allo-
HSCTs, and 1 subject underwent a third allo-HSCT after experiencing primary engraftment failure after 
both first and second allo-HSCTs. 
Table 25 Neutrophil engraftment (TP-102/104, TP-103) (Evaluable Patients, Day 120 
Update) 
 
Thus, as of the data cuts, all subjects infused with Skysona have had successful neutrophil 
engraftment, and none have required rescue cell therapy.  
The applicant also provided additional and updated data presentations that also included all treated 
patients (not just those considered ‘evaluable’ according to the SAP) and time to event methodology. 
These additional presentations were consistent with these data (see Table below).

Forty-nine of 51 Skysona treated subjects achieved NE; 2 subjects from Study ALD-104 had not yet 
achieved NE or been followed to at least Rel Day 43. No subjects treated with Skysona experienced 
either primary or secondary neutrophil engraftment failure, compared to 10/59 (16.9%) subjects 
treated with allo-HSCT, which included 6/59 (10.2%) subjects with primary engraftment failure and 
4/59 (6.8%) subjects with secondary engraftment failure. 
Table 26 Neutrophil engraftment (TP-102/104, TP-103) (TP Population, Day 120 Update) 
 
It was explored post-hoc whether changes in standard of care in allo-HSCT treated subjects over time 
had impacted the rates of NE failure in this population. However, 6 of 13 (46.2%) evaluable subjects 
treated after June 30, 2016 in the TP-103 population experienced primary or secondary engraftment 
failure by Month 24, ie a higher rate than in the overall TP-103 population (10/38 [26.3%]. These 
subjects all had no matched sibling donor.  
In TP-102/104, updated safety information shows all evaluable subjects (47/47 [100%]) had 
successful PE, with a median (min, max) PE on Rel Day 32 (14, 108). Four subjects from Study ALD-
104 were considered unevaluable for PE because they had not yet achieved PE or been followed for at 
least 24 months.  
In TP-103, 12 of 59 subjects were not considered evaluable for PE by Month 24 because they had 
primary or secondary engraftment failure or died. The 47 evaluable subjects all had successful PE, with 
median (min, max) PE occurring on Rel Day 26 (13, 67). 
Additional and updated analyses that also include all treated patients and time to event methodology 
showed consistent results (see Table below).

Adverse Events Attributed to Mobilisation/Apheresis 
Twenty-three of the 45 subjects (51.1%) experienced 36 AEs attributed to mobilisation/apheresis by 
the Investigator and all of these were reported in the Mobilisation to Conditioning period. The most 
frequently reported SOCs and PTs included:  
• 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (8/45 [17.8%]): The most frequently reported PTs included 
Hypomagnesaemia and Hypokalaemia, each in 5 subjects.  
• 
Gastrointestinal disorders (7/45 [15.6%]): The most frequently reported PTs included Nausea 
in 4 subjects and Vomiting in 3 subjects.  
• 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders (5/45 [11.1%]): The most frequently reported PT was 
Anaemia in 4 subjects.  
• 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5/45 [11.1%]): The most frequently reported 
PT was Bone pain in 4 subjects. 
All AEs attributed to mobilisation/apheresis were nonserious and all were Grade 1 or 2 in severity 
except for one Grade 3 AE of Hypokalaemia. 
Adverse Events Attributed to Conditioning 
The vast majority of the reported AEs in TP-102/104 were attributed to conditioning by the 
investigator. For example, 45 subjects reported 816 AEs in the C to <NE period, of which 684 events 
were deemed to be related to the conditioning.  
AEs were most frequently reported in the following SOCs (percentages provided reflect C to < NE 
incidence): Gastrointestinal disorders (45/45 [100%]), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (44/45 
[97.8%]), Metabolism and nutrition disorders (36/45 [80.0%]), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (28/45 [62.2%]). Subjects most frequently experienced AEs of Nausea (41/45 [91.1%]), 
Thrombocytopenia (41/45 [91.1%]), Anaemia (39/45 [86.7%]), Stomatitis (39/45 [86.7%]), and 
Neutropenia (37/45 [82.2%]). The distribution of the PTs was similar between the 2 studies 
considering the small patient numbers.  
The applicant discussed whether any relevant differences in safety profile were observed between the 
2 conditioning regimens used between the study ALD-102 (busulfan and cyclophosphamide) and ALD-
104 (busulfan and fludarabine). Data to date reflect, in general, a comparable profile between the 
conditioning regimens used given the small population and the characteristics of the used agents. 
However, 4 of the 19 subjects in the ongoing Study ALD-104 were not yet available for PE as of the 
data cut and there were at least 3 subjects with relatively long times to PE: these subjects in Study 
ALD-104 achieved PE after Rel Day 60 (Rel Day 104, 108, and 106 respectively). In addition, two of 
these 3 subjects reported SAEs of pancytopenia (still ongoing). Given the limited safety data available, 
a full B/R evaluation on this conditioning regimen is not yet possible. 
The majority of events were non-serious. In the initial MAA,  17 subjects experienced 26 SAEs 
attributed to conditioning, however (all of which resolved) that included 11 events of Febrile 
neutropenia, 8 events of Pyrexia, and 1 event each of Stomatitis, Otitis media, Decreased appetite, 
Device related infection, Streptococcus bacteraemia, Oral mucositis, and Constipation. 
There is close proximity in time, however, of Skysona administration in relation to the conditioning 
regimen (once the cyclophosphamide regimen was completed, this was followed by 1 rest day before 
Skysona infusion). In total, 532 of the 816 AEs that were overall reported in the period C to <NE 
(regardless of causality) were reported during or after D1. Of the 684 events attributed to conditioning 
by the investigator, 447 were reported during or after D1.

A side-by-side presentation of AEs (by SOC and PT) that emerged in the period ‘C to D1’ vs. ‘D1 to 
<NE’, respectively and a discussion of any patterns of interest was provided but did not reveal any new 
safety concerns. 
Adverse Events Treatment-Emergent to Skysona 
In the initial MAA for TP-102/104, all subjects (45/45) experienced at least 1 TEAE (occurring during or 
after administration of Skysona). A total of 5/45 (11.1%) subjects had TEAEs that were considered by 
the Investigator to be drug product related TEAEs. 
Two events were non-serious Grade 1 AEs of Vomiting that started and resolved on Rel Day 1, likely 
related to DMSO used as a cryopreservative in Skysona drug product. Three events were SUSARs: one 
case of Grade 3 SAE of viral cystitis in ALD-102 due to BK virus from Rel Day 42 to 48, which resolved 
with supportive treatment; and 2 SAEs of pancytopenia due to delayed haematopoietic reconstitution 
in ALD-104. Enrolment in this study was halted in October 2019 but resumed in February 2020.  
Both SAEs were considered to be possibly related to Skysona and are still ongoing events. The role of 
alternative possible causative factors (parvovirus, immune-related causes) remains unclear. Both 
subjects are clinically stable, however, with below-normal platelet levels.  
Post-engraftment cytopenias that required growth factor treatment were reported. Thirty of 45 
subjects in TP-102/104 received G-CSF in the period after NE (D120 Listing 46.2.8.19.3). In 22 of 
these subjects, G-CSF was administered continuously from prior to NE to shortly after NE. In general, 
post engraftment use of G-CSF was brief in duration and often associated with a clinical finding (e.g., 
febrile neutropenia) with the exception of the 2 subjects who experienced delayed haematopoietic 
reconstitution. In these subjects, G-CSF was administered more than 100 days after the subjects 
achieved NE. These two subjects received eltrombopag due to decreased platelets.  
All 45 patients were treated with antibiotic during the conditioning therapy (thus C to <NE). The 
majority (39, 86.7%) were treated with antibiotic due to an adverse event however, in the majority 
(n=35) of these patients, the adverse event was not directly related to an infection but rather a 
symptomatic treatment in cases where infections could not be excluded (diagnoses of e.g. ‘Pyrexia’, or 
‘Febrile neutropenia’. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include warning for prolonged cytopenia and this has 
also been included in the safety specification as an important identified risk. 
• 
Comparison of ≥Grade 3 TEAEs: Skysona and Allo-HSCT 
AE collection between TP-102/104 and TP-103 was considered only comparable for≥ Grade 3 TEAEs 
through Month 12 (excluding haematological toxicities related to conditioning medication), as well as ≥ 
Grade 3 TEAEs related to HSCT and TESAEs through Month 48. 
• 
In the Vascular disorders SOC, no subjects in TP-102/104 experienced an event, while 28/59 
subjects (47.5%) in TP-103 experienced 36 ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs. Twenty nine of these 36 events 
were Hypertension which was experienced by 28/59 (47.5%) subjects. Of these 28 subjects, 4 
were in the MSD subgroup and the remaining 24 subjects were in the NMSD subgroup. 
Hypertension is most likely a side effect of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine which is 
commonly used for post-allo-HSCT immunosuppression. 
• 
In the Infections and infestations SOC, 4 of 45 subjects (8.9%) in TP-102/104 experienced 6 ≥ 
Grade 3 TEAEs, whereas 34 of 59 subjects (57.6%) in TP-103 experienced 78 events. More 
subjects experienced ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs of infection attributed to conditioning in TP-103 (16/59 
[27.1%]) as compared to TP-102/104 (2/45 [4.4%]) which may be related to differences in 
the respective conditioning regimens used or difference in baseline characteristics.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
GvH disease 
No evaluable subjects (0/31) in TP-102 experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD by 
Month 24, compared to 26/50 (52%) subjects in TP-103 (see table and figure below). 
In the TPES-103 population, 10/27 (41.7%) developed either acute GVHD (≥Grade II) or chronic 
GVHD by Month 24 but for the subgroup of TPES-103 MSD patients (N=10), there were three (30.0%). 
Table 29 Proportion of subjects with either acute GVHD (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD by 
Month 24 – main analysis (TP-102, TP-103) (Initial MAA, evaluable patients) 
 
 
At the Day 120 data update, consistent with the data presented in the initial MAA, no Skysona treated 
subject (0/32 [0%]) in Study ALD-102 experienced acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD by Month 24 
compared to 26/50 (52%) evaluable subjects treated with allo-HSCT in Study ALD-103. 
For the TPES-103 population (N=27), 10/24 (41.7%) evaluable subjects experienced acute (≥ Grade 
II) or chronic GVHD by Month 24. 
Since no subjects experienced acute or chronic GVHD as of the updated data cuts, the median time to 
first acute or chronic GVHD continued not to be estimable and the data from TP-103 were unchanged 
from the original MAA.

An updated analysis of GVHD, using data from Q4 2020 for the entirety of the TP rather than subjects 
as defined in the SAP showed that no subjects treated with Skysona (TP-102/104) experienced either 
acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD. In contrast, among subjects who received allo-HSCT, 26/59 
(44.1%) subjects in TP-103 and 10/27 (37.0%) subjects in TPES-103 experienced either acute (≥ 
Grade II) or chronic GVHD.

In an additional competing risk sensitivity analysis with engraftment failure (primary and secondary), 
transplant related mortality, and death as competing risks. No GVHD events were observed by Month 
24 in TP-102 resulting in an estimated cumulative incidence function (CIF) of 0% at Month 24 as 
compared to the estimated CIF of 37.8% (95% CI: 25.0, 50.5) in TP-103. The CIF estimate for TP-103 
MSD (N=11) was 29.3% (95% CI: 6.0, 58.4) and for TP-103 NMSD (N=48): 39.4 (25.1, 53.4).  
Treatment-emergent infections 
In TP-102/104, 20/45 (44.4%) subjects experienced TEAEs in the Infections and infestations SOC, 
predominantly during NE to M12 (15/45 [33.3%]). 
The majority of infections in TP-102/104 were nonserious, not opportunistic, and either self-limited or 
resolved with standard therapy. None of the infections except for a case of viral cystitis was considered 
related to Skysona by the investigator.  
In Study TP-103, there were 4 fatal infections experienced by 3 subjects. 
Other events of interest 
At the time of the interim data cut, there were no AEs or events of interest attributable to the use of 
an LVV for the ex vivo transduction of autologous cells, i.e. no confirmed detection of replication of 
competent lentivirus (RCL), or malignancy. 
However, one subject in the ongoing Study LTF-304 (who received Skysona in Study ALD-102) has 
shown a gradual, persistent expansion of a single clone. Integration site analyses (ISA) has shown a 
persistent high relative IS-frequency of 3 IS (with one of the IS in the MECOM gene) in a single clone 
over time, with a relative clonal contribution of ~14% in PBLs and ~41% in myeloid cells at Month 60 
and 49% to 59% at Month 65 (see table below). As of the Year 6 evaluation, samples collected during 
Year 6 Visit qPCR analyses showed that IS-specific VCN estimated a clonal contribution of ~30% in 
peripheral blood leukocytes and ~77% in myeloid lineage (CD15+ cells).  
Since MAA submission, one additional subject from Study ALD-104 has developed a predominant clone 
with 4 IS, including an IS in MECOM.  
Transcription analysis of these subjects reveals dysregulation of the MECOM gene, resulting in 
increased levels of a subset of MECOM transcripts.  
Both subjects continue to be followed but remain clinically stable with no evidence of malignancy (see 
also Section Laboratory findings for further details on ISA analyses).  
Insertional oncogenesis is included in the safety specification as important potential risk.

Long-term safety - adverse events in Study ALD-304 
In the initial MAA, results were presented for the 21 enrolled subjects from Study ALD-102 as of the 
data cut date (31 January 2020). Subjects from Study ALD-104 have not yet enrolled. Subject are to 
be followed through to Year 15 post-drug product infusion (the parent study includes approximately 2 
years follow-up after drug product infusion) and the current median follow-up time is 56 months.  
As of the cut-off date, no subjects experienced GVHD or underwent a second stem cell transplantation.  
No deaths or AEs related to Skysona have been reported during this study.  
Seven SAEs in 4 subjects were reported: 3 SAEs of Seizure, and 1 SAE each of Fatigue, Depression, 
Suicidal ideation, and Pyrexia. None of the events were considered related to Skysona. 
The Day 120 Safety Update revealed 2 additional SAEs in this study: both SAEs of Seizure and not 
related to Skysona. As stated above, ISA revealed 1 subject in LTF-304 with a predominant clone.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
One death (1/45, 2.2%) was reported in TP-102/104. Subject experienced rapid CALD disease 
progression starting 2 weeks after treatment with Skysona (Loes score increase from 6.5 at Baseline to 
13.5 at Day 14) with SAEs of Neurological decompensation eventually followed by Cardio-respiratory 
arrest on Rel Day 666.  
One additional subject died due to complications of allogeneic transplantation after receiving allo-HSCT 
off study.  
Neither of the deaths were considered related to Skysona. 
Up to the interim cut-off date, 15/59 (25.4%) subjects died in TP-103 (12 after first allo-HSCT and 3 
after second allo-HSCT), 9 of whom had transplant-related mortality (TRM). The 6 non-TRM deaths 
were attributed to progressive disease/CALD in 3 subjects, and in 3 subjects the cause of death or 
attribution was unknown. 
Two of the 15 deaths occurred in MSD subjects. One case was attributed to GVHD. The other subject 
died from Septic shock attributed to unknown cause. 
No deaths were reported in LFT-304 up to the cut-off date for the interim analysis.

In TP-102/104, 27/45 (60%) subjects experienced 63 TESAEs from D1 through Last Follow-up. the 
overall SAE profile was largely consistent with the effects of conditioning. The most frequently 
experienced TESAEs were related to Blood and lymphatic system disorders (12/45 [26.7%]), General 
disorders and administration site conditions (10/45 [22.2%]), Infections and infestations (7/45 
[15.6%]), and Gastrointestinal disorders (5/45 [11.1%]). 
Three subjects had SAEs that were considered possibly related to Skysona. 
Two of the SAEs that were assessed by the Investigator to be possibly related to Skysona were the 
events of pancytopenia previously discussed (from study ALD-104).  
In study ALD-102, one SAE, an event of Cystitis viral (Grade 3), was assessed by the Investigator as 
possibly related to Skysona. This subject (with a medical history of adrenal insufficiency), was 
diagnosed with BK virus haemorrhagic cystitis on Rel Day 44 and fully recovered following 
symptomatic treatment. Overall, a causal relationship to Skysona seems unlikely.  
All TESAEs resolved with the exception of the SAEs ongoing at the time of death in one subject, the 
SAEs of pancytopenia in two subjects. Updated narratives reported that both events of pancytopenia 
are not resolved. One of the subjects was treated with immunosuppressants with no response. Both 
subjects were clinically stable with no need for platelet transfusions or eltrombopag but still had below-
normal platelet levels.   
The reported cases of pancytopenia are reflected in the SmPC. 
In addition, there is an ongoing SAE of Grade 3 myelitis transverse in one subject. The event was 
considered not or unlikely related to Skysona by the investigator. The aetiology remains unclear but 
there was no evidence of an immunogenic reaction.  
The proportion of subjects with serious infections was more than 2-fold higher in TP-103 than in TP-
102/104 (22/59 [37.3%] vs 7/45 [15.6%], respectively), and the number of serious infections was 
more than 5-fold higher (47 events vs 8 events, respectively). Many serious infections in TP-103 were 
opportunistic (14 SAEs), reflective of the subjects’ chronically immunocompromised state, while 1 
serious opportunistic infection was reported in TP-102/104 (Cystitis viral). The majority of TESAE 
infections (38/47 events) in TP-103 were in 16 subjects in the NMSD subgroup.  
There were no TESAEs reported in the Vascular disorders SOC for TP-102/104; however, 7/59 (11.9%) 
subjects in TP-103 experienced 8 TESAEs in this SOC, with 6 of these 7 subjects in the NMSD 
subgroup. Two subjects had serious events of hypertension, a known consequence of 
immunosuppressants, and 4 subjects had 4 events that were thrombotic (e.g., cerebral infarction, 
deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis, and veno-occlusive disease), which may be linked the endothelial 
effects of immunosuppression.  
Two subjects in TP-103 experienced 3 TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator. One 
NMSD subject experienced a TESAE of Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and an MSD subject 
experienced 2 TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator, haemolytic anaemia and 
encephalopathy.

Note: PTs (and their associated SOC) are included for all SAEs that were observed in the D1 to M48 study period 
and are sorted based on decreasing frequency by SOC and then PT (and then alphabetically) based on TP-103 
overall. Subjects at risk for each period (N in column header) is defined to be the subjects who entered the study 
period. If event started in one reporting period and continued into the next reporting period, it was counted only in 
the first period. If event started and stopped in one reporting period and then recurred in the next reporting period, 
it was counted in both periods. Subjects were counted once for each SOC and PT even if they had multiple instances 
of the event in one period. For SAEs with worsening severity in which the AE started in the first period and 
worsened in the next period, the subject was counted in both periods. All events reported in the database are 
counted in the number of events. 
 
In the ongoing study LTF-304, 7 SAEs in 4 subjects were reported in the initial MAA: 3 SAEs of seizure, 
and 1 each of fatigue, depression, suicidal ideation, and pyrexia. None of the SAEs was considered 
related to Skysona.  
Five additional subjects reported new TESAEs have been reported since the initial MAA data cuts, 3 
subjects from the ongoing Study ALD-104 and 2 subjects in the ongoing Study LTF-304 (originally 
enrolled in ALD-102). The cases in Study ALD-104 referred to Pseudomonal bacteraemia (attributed to 
conditioning), Pyrexia (attributed to catheter removal) and febrile neutropenia (attributed to 
conditioning). All events resolved. In Study LTF-304, there were 2 SAEs of seizure, not considered 
related to Skysona.

In addition, a late-breaking data cut from the safety database on 05 February 2021 identified 5 new 
SAEs. These were 2 cases of seizure, one case of pyrexia, one case of viral upper respiratory tract 
infection, and one case of Pseudomonal bacteraemia and Stenotrophomonas infection. None of these 
events were considered related to Skysona by the Investigator but consistent with the effects of 
conditioning and/or underlying disease. 
Laboratory findings 
Severe depletion of neutrophils and platelets was observed during and after conditioning as expected.  
In TP-102/104, 10 subjects had non-serious AEs of neutropenia reported within days of NE and 6 
subjects had non-serious AEs of thrombocytopenia reported within days of PE. Post-engraftment 
cytopenias were generally transient and resolved except for the 2 subjects in Study ALD-104 who had 
ongoing SUSARs of pancytopenia at the time of the interim data cut. One of these subjects remained 
reportedly stable with no need for platelet transfusions or eltrombopag but the event of pancytopenia 
was not considered fully resolved at the time of submission. On Rel Day 573, laboratory results showed 
WBC 3.1 × 109 cells/L, ANC 2.1 ×109 cells/L, haemoglobin 11.6 g/dL, platelets 27 × 109 cells/L. For 
the other subject, the event is also still ongoing. On Rel Day 510, laboratory results showed WBC 3.6 
× 109 cells/L, ANC 0.7 × 109 cells/L, haemoglobin 13.7 g/dL, platelets 127 × 109 cells/L with no need 
for platelet transfusions or eltrombopag. 
In both cases, the grade 3 Pancytopenia was considered at least possibly related to Skysona although 
other causal factors (the role of parvovirus or potential immune-related causes) could not be excluded. 
In TP-102/104, hypokalaemia during the C to NE period was the most common electrolyte disturbance, 
with PCS (threshold of ≤3 mmol/L) low values noted in 24/45 (53.3%). No subjects evaluable after 
Month 12 had potassium values meeting low PCS criteria. AE reporting was generally consistent with 
this observation.  
A total of 25 (55.6%) of all patients experienced at least one episode of Grade ≥3 hypokalaemia. The 
majority of the patients experienced hypokalaemia during the conditioning period (C to NE) and most 
often hypokalaemia could be attributed to either vomiting or diarrhoea which could likely be an 
adverse reaction to the conditioning treatment. Overall, hypokalaemia is commonly reported during 
both the mobilisation/apheresis and the conditioning treatment and this has been reflected in the 
SmPC.

Detection of Replication Competent Lentivirus 
All patients were screened and confirmed to be negative for lenti- and/or retroviral infections as a 
condition for receiving treatment with Skysona. As of the database lock, there have been no confirmed 
positive results for LVV-derived RCL in any subject treated with Skysona. In Studies ALD-102 and ALD-
104, RCL samples are tested through Month 12 as outlined in the protocol. If all results are negative, 
subsequent samples in these studies, as well as in the long-term follow up study LTF-304, are collected 
and archived. The RCL analysis was (or is) not performed routinely during LTF-304 but this has been 
sufficiently justified.  
Integration Site Analysis 
Clinical study subjects are being monitored by ISA at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, followed 
by every 6 months up to 5 years post-drug product infusion, and then at Years 7, 10, and 15. 
The initial MAA reported on the IS monitoring performed in the 32 subjects who were enrolled in the 
open-label clinical Phase 2/3 Study ALD-102 or its long-term follow-up Study LTF-304. In total, 
>334,400 unique IS were identified.  
Among these, IS in the SMG6 and MECOM genes were the most frequently detected in over 190 
different samples from all 32 subjects analysed. 
In updated results, multiple subjects had at least one IS within SMG6 (25/27 in Study LTF-304) or 
within MECOM (14/27 in Study LTF-304) in their top 10 genes. Multiple SMG6 IS was detected in the 
Top 10 most frequent IS in multiple subjects at multiple time points by screening ISA of peripheral 
blood, although none reached a relative IS frequency of >30% in more than two consecutive analysis 
time points. To date, none of these IS have been associated with a predominant clone. Insertion of an 
MNDU3 promoter-GFP transgene did not result in overexpression of the SMG6 gene in cultured CD34+ 
cells. 
One subject in Study LTF-304 (who received Skysona in Study ALD-102) has shown a gradual, 
persistent expansion of a single clone over time. The predominant clone had 3 integration sites (IS) in 
the genes ACER3, RFX3, and MECOM.  
As of the Year 6 evaluation, samples collected during Year 6 Visit qPCR analyses showed that IS-
specific VCN estimated a clonal contribution of ~30% in peripheral blood leukocytes and ~77% in 
myeloid lineage (CD15+ cells).  
Clinically, this subject has normal haemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell count and a neutrophil 
count at the lower end of the normal range.  
In addition, one subject who was treated with Skysona in Study ALD-104 has been identified with a 
predominant clone with 4 IS, including an IS in MECOM (ACTR3, RAP2C-AS1, ST3GAL6-AS1, and 
MECOM). This subject first met the criteria at approximately 6 months after treatment. At Month 12, 
cells arising from the progenitor cell account for ~64% to 81% of peripheral blood leukocytes and 80-
90% of CD15+ cells. The patient is clinically stable with mild thrombocytopenia due ongoing event of 
delayed haematopoietic reconstitution.  
Relative expression studies could not be performed for SMG6 expression. For MECOM, the results 
showed elevated expression of Total and Short MECOM transcripts in CD15+ cells in the above subject 
at Month 65 (when clonal dominance was observed), as compared to a normal human donor. Similarly, 
in another subject, Total and Short MECOM transcripts were found to be elevated in whole blood at 
Month 12 as compared to a normal donor control.  
The totality of the data collected from transcription analyses of the two predominant clones with IS in 
MECOM is consistent with dysregulation of MECOM expression, likely as a result of vector insertion.

Expression dysregulation at the MECOM locus could contribute to clonal expansion resulting in clonal 
predominance, although the mechanism is not clear. MECOM expression in both subjects was elevated 
relative to control cells, however the mechanism of this apparent dysregulation and the relationship to 
clonal expansion is not known. There is currently no indication that these subjects are overexpressing 
ALDP as a result.  
Both subjects showed a higher clonal distribution in CD15+ cells, suggesting a preference for the 
myeloid lineage. Data on neutrophilic function assays is not available.  
There has been no clinical or haematological evidence of malignancy in any of the subjects to date. 
Whole exome sequencing was conducted at Month 67 for one Subject (the latter) did not reveal any 
mutations of interest. Repeated investigation of a selected panel of 95 genes in this subject did not 
reveal pathogenic variants and cytogenetic analyses results were normal as well. No whole genome or 
exome sequencing data are available for the former subject to date. 
Insertional oncogenesis (e.g. myelodysplasia, leukaemia, lymphoma) has been included in the safety 
specification of Skysona as an important potential risk.  
ISA data will continue to be collected in the ongoing clinical trials, and in the planned registry study, to 
further the understanding of clonal dynamics in the long term.  
A cautionary statement is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC advising that patients be monitored with 
at least annual peripheral blood counts and additional testing (including bone marrow analysis) if 
needed. 
Safety in special populations 
CALD is a rare X-linked disease with paediatric onset, demographics reveal a homogeneous population 
without sufficient numbers of subjects in different demographic groups to enable meaningful 
comparisons. 
Immunological events 
There was no evidence towards a significant risk of hypersensitivity reactions with Skysona, however, 
study subjects received myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and either cyclophosphamide (Study 
ALD-102) or fludarabine (Study ALD-104). 
In general, the risk of an adaptive immune response to the transgene product or the vector needs to 
be considered for a gene therapy product. Regarding the vector, since pre-exposition is excluded and 
no repeated administration is intended, the lack of data is acceptable. The applicant has also 
sufficiently justified that an assay to detect and measure anti-ALDP antibodies could be omitted as the 
risk of immunogenicity in terms of anti-ALDP antibody formation is very low.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies were performed with Skysona. There were no AEs observed in 
subjects suggestive of any potential drug-drug interaction with Skysona.  
Given the theoretical potential for anti-retroviral medications to interfere with transduction of mobilised 
autologous cells and/or subsequent integration by the LVV, patients should not take anti-retroviral 
medicinal products from at least one month prior to mobilisation until at least apheresis is completed.

Discontinuation due to AES 
There were no AEs leading to withdrawal or discontinuation in Studies ALD-102 and ALD-104, nor in 
ALD-304 as of the cut-off date. All treated subjects remain on study.  
Study ALD-101 
Study ALD-101 was a retrospective non-interventional study (data collected April 2011 to March 2012), 
to characterize the natural history of CALD and identify specific subset(s) of the overall population that 
would most likely benefit from Skysona. This retrospective chart review study included both patients 
who received allo-HSCT transplants and those who were untreated. 
Only limited comparisons were made with the AE profile of allo-HSCT in this study, as Study ALD-103 
included more contemporaneous and comprehensive safety data collection. In summary, the untreated 
cohort included 72 and the allo-HSCT cohort 65 subjects. During the data collection period, 40/72 
(56%) of subjects in the untreated cohort died with underlying disease progression reported as the 
primary cause of death in 31/40 (78%). The incidence of serious infections in this cohort during this 
period was 7%. In the allo-HSCT cohort, 16/65 (25%) died during the data collection period with 
disease progression (7/16, 44%) and infection (5/16, 31%) as the most common causes of death.  
The incidence of graft failure was 18% (12/65). Subjects without an HLA-matched donor were most 
likely to suffer engraftment failure: 8/32 (25%) subjects with mismatched unrelated donors, l/5 (20%) 
subjects with mismatched related donors. 
Despite prophylaxis, the incidence of GVHD was 59%, with acute GYHD in 45% subjects and chronic 
GVHD in 21% of subjects with the potential to undergo GVHD. The incidence of GVHD was highest 
amongst those with an HLA-mismatched, unrelated donor (22/27; 82%).

2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Current safety database 
The data supporting the safety profile of Skysona are limited to 45 subjects with CALD that have been 
treated in single-arm studies, 32 in Study ALD-102 and 13 in Study ALD-104. Limited long-term 
follow-up data are provided by Study LTF-304.  
Treatment with elicel is preceded by haematopoietic stem cell collection (mobilisation with G-CSF and, 
if needed, plerixafor followed by apheresis and myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and either 
cyclophosphamide (ALD-102) or fludarabine (ALD-104). The exposure to mobilisation and conditioning 
agents prior to Skysona infusion should thus be considered in the evaluation of the safety data.  
Two completed studies using allo-HSCT were included to provide contextual data. The most 
contemporary one, Study ALD-103, is a prospective and retrospective data collection study of allo-
HSCT and provided safety comparisons for ≥ Grade 3 AEs; ≥Grade 3 AEs related to HSCI; and SAEs. 
Study ALD-101 is an older, retrospective non-interventional data collection study of subjects either 
untreated or treated with allo-HSCT.  
All subjects treated with Skysona received a single lot with a dose of ≥ 5.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg and 
were followed for a total median (min, max) time of 56.44 (22.1, 70.7) months post-drug product 
infusion for the initial MAA.

Safety data 
In TP-102/104, all subjects followed to at least Rel Day 43 had successful NE, with a median (min, 
max) NE on Rel Day 13 (11, 41). In TP-103, 53/59 (89.8%) subjects achieved primary NE, with a 
median (min, max) NE on Rel Day 17 (12, 36). No primary or secondary NE failure was observed in 
evaluable TP-102/104 subjects. Overall, 43/45 subjects achieved PE by Rel Day 60. One subject 
achieved PE on Rel Day 108, and one subject is still pending. Both of these subjects developed SAEs of 
pancytopenia which were still ongoing at the time of the initial data cut. Updated narratives were 
requested which revealed that the events remain ongoing although neither subject requires 
transfusions or growth factor support.   
Pancytopenia has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC as well as included in the safety 
specification as an identified risk. 
Primary or secondary NE failure was experienced by 10/38 (26.3%) evaluable subjects by Month 24 in 
the allo-HSCT study TP-103, all of whom were NMSD subjects. In TP-103, 12 of 59 subjects were not 
evaluable for PE by Month 24 because they had primary or secondary engraftment failure or died. The 
47 evaluable subjects all had successful PE, with median (min, max) PE occurring on Rel Day 26 (13, 
67). However, these analyses were based on interim data and ‘evaluable subjects’ only. Additional and 
updated analyses that also include all treated patients and time to event methodology were requested. 
In this analysis, 49 of 51 Skysona treated subjects (96.1%) achieved NE compared to 53 of 59 
(89.8%) of allo-HSCT patients. No subjects treated with Skysona experienced either primary or 
secondary neutrophil engraftment failure (compared to 10/59 (16.9%) subjects treated with allo-
HSCT). Most subjects treated with Skysona, 47/51 (92.2%) subjects, achieved PE, compared to 47/59 
(79.7%) subjects treated with allo-HSCT. Four subjects in Study ALD-104 had not yet achieved PE or 
been followed for at least 24 months.  
The SmPC has been updated to reflect the analyses based on the entire TP population. 
In TP-102/104, almost all subjects experienced AEs that were attributable to mobilisation/apheresis. 
Frequently reported PTs included hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, nausea, vomiting, anaemia, and 
bone pain. Also, subjects frequently experienced TEAEs consistent with the effects of conditioning 
(e.g., thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, and alopecia). 
However, given the close proximity in time of Skysona administration in relation to the conditioning 
regimen (once the cyclophosphamide regimen was completed, this was followed by 1 rest day before 
Skysona infusion), some additional AE presentations were requested which did not reveal new 
concerns.  
An assessment of AEs between the ALD-102 and ALD-104 studies shows, in general, a comparable 
profile considering the small patient population. Some differences were notable (such as 
gastrointestinal AEs) consistent with the respective agents used. The applicant also considers the NE 
and PE data between the two regimens to be comparable. This can be partially agreed considering 
median values but numerically, there seem to be more outlier subjects with later PE in ALD-104; the 
median (min, max) Rel Day of PE was Rel Day 32 (16, 60) in Study ALD-102 and Rel Day 29 (14, 108) 
in Study ALD-104. Four of the 19 subjects in the ongoing Study ALD-104 were not yet available for PE 
as of the latest data cut. However, there were at least 3 subjects with relatively long times to PE) in 
Study ALD-104 achieved PE after Rel Day 60 (Rel Day 104, 108, and 106 respectively). In addition, 
two of these subjects were reported with SAEs of pancytopenia (still ongoing). Thus, relevant safety 
information obtained with ALD-104 is included in the SmPC. However, given the absence of sufficient 
efficacy data and the limited safety data available, a full B/R evaluation on this conditioning regimen is 
not yet possible.

A total of 5/45 (11.1%) subjects had TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be drug 
product related TEAEs. These included Grade 1 events of vomiting likely related to DMSO used as a 
cryopreservative in Skysona drug product; one severe case of haemorrhagic cystitis, and the above-
stated two cases of ongoing pancytopenia. Post-engraftment cytopenias that required growth factor 
treatment were reported and 30 of 45 subjects in TP-102/104 received G-CSF in the period after NE. 
In most of these subjects, G-CSF was administered continuously from prior to NE to shortly after NE, 
was brief in duration and often associated with a clinical finding (e.g., febrile neutropenia). This with 
the exception of the 2 subjects who experienced delayed haematopoietic reconstitution and who 
received G-CSF for more than 100 days after the subjects achieved NE. These 2 subjects also received 
eltrombopag due to decreased platelets.  
All 45 patients were treated with antibiotic during the conditioning therapy (thus C to <NE). The 
majority (39, 86.7%) were treated with antibiotic due to an adverse event however, in the majority 
(n=35) of these patients, the adverse event was not directly related to an infection but rather a 
symptomatic treatment in cases where infections could not be excluded (due to e.g. ‘Pyrexia’, or 
‘Febrile neutropenia’). 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include a warning for prolonged cytopenia and that cases 
of pancytopenia have been reported, and these events are included in the safety specification as an 
important identified risk. In addition, delayed platelet engraftment has been included in the safety 
specification as a potential risk.  
A contextual comparison for AEs between TP-102/104 and TP-103 could only be made for≥ Grade 3 
TEAEs through Month 12 (excluding haematological toxicities related to conditioning medication), as 
well as ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs related to HSCT and TESAEs through Month 48. The pattern of Grade 3 non-
haematological AEs that were attributed to conditioning by the Investigator was generally similar 
between TP-103 (36/59 [61%]) and TP-102/104 (29/45 [64.4%]). A higher percentage of subjects 
experienced ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs of infection attributed to conditioning in TP-103 (16/59 [27.1%]) as 
compared to TP-102/104 (2/45 [4.4%]) which may be related to differences in the respective 
conditioning regimens used or difference in baseline characteristics. None of the infections except for 
the case of viral cystitis was considered related to Skysona by the investigator. In Study TP-103, there 
were 4 fatal infections experienced by 3 subjects (see deaths below). 
No evaluable subjects (0/31) in TP-102 experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD by 
Month 24, compared to 26/50 (52%) evaluable subjects in TP-103. However, as these analyses are 
based on ‘evaluable subjects’ only, some clarifications and supplementary analyses were requested 
and the SmPC was updated to reflect the analyses based on the entire TP population. Time to first 
acute (≥Grade II) or chronic GVHD event analyses were also performed to supplement the proportional 
primary endpoint, in line with scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/82607/2018).  
One death (1/45, 2.2%) was reported in TP-102/104 and a second subject died after receiving allo-
HSCT off study. None of the deaths was considered related to Skysona. In comparison, 15/59 (25.4%) 
subjects died in TP-103 (12 after first allo-HSCT and 3 after second allo-HSCT), 9 of whom had 
transplant-related mortality (TRM). 
Overall, 27/45 (60%) subjects experienced 63 TESAEs from D1 through Last Follow-up. The overall 
SAE profile was largely consistent with the effects of conditioning. The applicant provided an updated 
narrative for a reported case of transverse myelitis, together with a discussion whether Skysona could 
have triggered an immune reaction but this appears to be unlikely.  
Limited long-term safety data were presented for 21 subjects enrolled in the ongoing open-label 
extension study LTF-304. As of the initial cut-off date, no subjects experienced GVHD or underwent a

second stem cell transplantation. Seven SAEs in 4 subjects were reported, none of which were 
attributed to Skysona. 
There were 5 subjects who reported new TESAEs as of the new data cut (Q4 2020). In addition, the 
applicant reported 5 new (additional) SAEs as Late Breaking Information. Overall, 6 of these new SAEs 
related to serious events of infection/pyrexia/neutropenia and 4 events related to seizures. Adding 
these late-breaking events, the proportion of subjects with SAEs of infection seems to be similar for 
both the ALD-102 and ALD-104 studies, i.e. numerically not favouring the new conditioning regimen. 
However, the numbers are small, and this would need to be further followed.  
At the time of the interim data cut, there were no other AEs or events of interest attributable to the 
use of an LVV for the ex vivo transduction of autologous cells, i.e. no detection of replication of 
competent lentivirus (RCL), or malignancy.  
ISA analyses in the 32 treated subjects from ALD-102 with available ISA results as of 04 February 
2020 (up to 6 years of follow-up) showed 334,492 unique IS being detected in 191 samples. Some 
gene locations were detected amongst the Top 10 IS per subject per visit at multiple times both 
between and within subjects, with IS in the SMG6 and MECOM genes being the most frequently 
detected. 
One subject has shown a persistent high Relative IS-Frequency of 3 IS (with one of the IS in the 
MECOM gene) in a single clone over time. Since the initial MAA, one additional subject from Study 
ALD-104 has also been identified with a predominant clone with 4 IS, including an IS in MECOM. 
In a late-breaking update (31 March 2021), the applicant has provided updated information from the 
Year 6 evaluation (January 2021) for one of these subjects. ISA results confirmed the persistence of 
the predominant clone previously identified at Month 65. Analysis of subpopulations of blood cells 
showed that this clone was most highly represented in cells of the myeloid lineage, increasing in its 
clonal contribution to CD15+ cells from approximately 21% to 25% at Month 48 to 74% to 81% at 
Year 6. As this clone thus exceeded a clonal contribution to CD15+ cells of 50% at both Month 65 and 
Year 6 Visits, it satisfied the protocol definition of being a persistent predominant clone in this cell 
population.  
The subject’s clinical status is unchanged with normal haemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell 
count and a neutrophil count at the lower end of the normal range and will continue to be monitored 
closely. 
Relative expression studies showed elevated expression of Total and Short MECOM transcripts in 
CD15+ cells in this subject at Month 65 (when clonal dominance was observed), as compared to a 
normal human donor. Similarly, in another subject, Total and Short MECOM transcripts were found to 
be elevated in whole blood at Month 12 as compared to a normal donor control.  
There is currently no indication that these subjects are overexpressing ALDP as a result.  
The applicant concludes that these findings are consistent with dysregulation of MECOM expression, 
likely as a result of the insertion of the LVV into the MECOM gene. The mechanism for the increased 
MECOM expression is unclear. While the applicant is suggesting that is unlikely that the MNDU3 
promoter is directly controlling MECOM expression, this is the most plausible explanation in line what 
has previously been reported for X-CGD and Wiskott Aldrich clinical trials. The position of the 
integration of the two dominant clones in these subjects is in the same region of MECOM (intron 2) of 
dominant IS in patients with X-CGD and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome that eventually developed AML 
after 2-3 years from the initial clonal dominance. Internal viral promoters have been described in 
preclinical models to influence expression of nearby genes even when placed internally in self-

inactivating vectors. On the other hand, X-CGD and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome may carry additional 
intrinsic risk factors as compared to X-ALD cells.  
Thus, it is possible that these dominant clones will remain benign, such as in most cases of clonal 
haematopoiesis in aging, without evolving in leukaemia. There is no clinical or haematological evidence 
of malignancy to date.  
Cases of haematologic malignancies due to insertional oncogenesis following gene therapy have been 
reported to occur with retroviral vectors but not the modified LVV to date. The potential risk of 
insertional oncogenesis will need to be handled in the RMP, however.  
The potential need for additional post-authorisation follow-up for Skysona has been previously 
discussed with the applicant, as outlined in e.g. various scientific advice procedures. In addition to the 
ongoing study LTF-304, the applicant proposes to conduct the post-approval registry study REG-502 
(see also Section 3.4.9 below).  
Given that the ISA analyses form an area of significant safety interest, the applicant will continue to 
collect ISA data in the setting of studies and evaluate its association with clinical events. In study LTF-
304, ISA is to be scheduled every 6 months for 5 years and then annually to Year 15. In the planned 
study REG-502, ISA is also offered on an annual basis until the end of the study. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
 
Overall, the current safety data are considered favourable in the context of the intended population. 
Additional safety data will be required for the long-term follow-up of the product in accordance with 
risks described in the safety specification. In addition, the additional safety data from the ongoing ALD-
104 study will be of value to further inform the prescriber on the safety of the product in combination 
with other conditioning regimens than the one used in the pivotal ALD-102 study. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, based on the current limited data, the safety profile of Skysona appears to be acceptable; 
however, it should be considered that, similar to allo-HSCT, treatment with Skysona is preceded by 
significant procedural and medical interventions, including haematopoietic stem cell collection and 
myeloablative conditioning. The safety of Skysona seems clearly favourable over allo-HSCT for those 
subjects without a matched sibling donor. There are outstanding uncertainties related to long-term 
safety, including the potential risk of insertional oncogenesis, since two patients have been shown to 
have a dominant clone, albeit without clinical symptoms. 
In addition to the ongoing study LTF-304, the applicant proposes to conduct the post-approval registry 
study REG-502. Additional safety data will indeed be required for the long-term follow-up of the 
product in accordance with risks described in the safety specification. In addition, the additional safety 
data from the ongoing ALD-104 study will be of value to further inform the prescriber on the safety of 
the product in combination with other conditioning regimens than the one used in the pivotal ALD-102 
study. 
Overall, the safety profile of Skysona is considered favourable for a positive Benefit/Risk balance from 
a safety point of view considering the intended patient population. The CAT considered the following 
measures necessary to further inform the long-term safety profile of the product: 
- In order to further characterise and contextualise the long-term safety and efficacy of Skysona in 
patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), the MAH should conduct, and submit the results 
of a prospective observational Registry Study (REG-502) of patients with CALD treated with Skysona or

allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) according to an agreed protocol 
(Stargazer). 
- In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Skysona in patients with cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), the MAH should submit final results of Study LTF-304. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CAT/CHMP Opinion. The IBD will be the EBD. The new EURD list 
entry will therefore use the European Birth Date (EBD) to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that elivaldogene autotemcel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, considers elivaldogene autotemcel to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group; the use of 
minimum particulars for the bag infusion label was agreed.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group: 
The Group accepted the exemption requests to use English only for the labelling components/package 
leaflet. Furthermore, the Group also agreed with the provision of the use of the national languages for 
the Lot Information Sheet and for the package leaflet at the time of consent to treatment. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Skysona (elivaldogene autotemcel) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 
2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: Skysona is indicated for the treatment of early cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for 
whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not 
available (see section 5.1). 
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare, X-linked, metabolic disease in which dysfunction or lack of the 
ALD protein (ALDP) is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily D member 1 
(ABCD1) gene. ALDP is a peroxisomal transport protein involved in the transport and degradation of 
very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), leading to accumulation of VLCFAs, which occurs most prominently 
in the adrenal cortex and white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Cerebral ALD (CALD) is the most 
severe form of ALD, affecting approximately 30-40% of boys with ALD, typically during childhood. 
CALD is characterised by inflammation of white matter and rapidly progressive cerebral demyelination 
leading to progressive, irreversible loss of neurologic function. Disease progression and neurologic 
decline in patients with CALD have been documented in natural history studies; patients experience 
critical deficits across multiple neurological domains within a short period after onset of clinical 
symptoms (Suzuki et al. 2005). In children diagnosed with CALD, learning and behavioural problems 
are often observed at the time of disease onset in early- to mid-childhood (median age 7 years) with 
progressive gait, vision, and hearing impairments within 6 to 15 months of symptom onset (Suzuki et 
al. 2005). This is typically followed by rapid neurologic functional decline (Moser et al. 2007) (CSR 
ALD-101). If untreated, nearly half of patients with CALD die within 5 years of symptom onset. 
For boys with a genetic diagnosis of ALD, regular MRIs of the brain are used to detect early signs of 
onset of CALD (i.e. contrast enhancement, white matter involvement) which indicate that a patient is 
at high risk for rapid progression. When signs of CALD have developed, the patient should be treated. 
The aim of allo-HSCT or Skysona, which is an autologous HSCT with ex vivo lentiviral vector gene 
transfer of the ABCD1 gene, is to halt neuroinflammation and cerebral demyelination and maintain 
independent living for the affected boys. No effects of allo-HSCT have been seen on other disease 
manifestations of ALD, such as adrenal insufficiency, and the slowly developing spinal and peripheral 
nerves neuropathy in adulthood. It is anticipated that Skysona will only have beneficial effects on the 
cerebral inflammation part of the disease, just as has been observed for allo-HSCT treatment. 
Males who do not develop childhood cerebral ALD may still develop more benign variants of the 
disease, the most common being a more slowly progressive adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which 
typically develops during the 2nd to 3rd decade of life. A few adult males may develop the cerebral form 
of the disease, but with different disease characteristics (including psychiatric symptoms) than the 
childhood CALD. Furthermore, in adults, the cerebral symptoms are often superimposed on the 
myeloneuropathy. Women are normally only carriers of the ABCD1 gene mutation and will transfer the 
mutation to their offspring. However, women may develop mild AMN in adult age and there are a few 
case reports of girls with childhood CALD. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a therapeutic option that has been 
used for a few decades and that can stabilise progression of CALD. The best outcomes are observed if 
it is performed at early stages of cerebral involvement, i.e. MRI scoring Loes ≤9 and Neurological

Page 125/136 
 
Function Scale (NFS) ≤1. Allo-HSCT has potential complications, including risks for transplant-related 
mortality, graft failure, graft-versus-host disease, and infection. These risks are decreased in patients 
who have a human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor; which fewer than 30% of patients have. 
There is a high unmet medical need for efficacious therapies for CALD that have an improved safety 
profile compared to allo-HSCT, especially for those who do not have a matched sibling donor. 
The unmet medical need for patients with CALD has been acknowledged in the applicant’s request for 
accelerated assessment that had been granted.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy stems from study ADL 102. Data from the ongoing study ALD-104 and 
long term follow up ALD-304 support the safety and efficacy of the product. Studies ALD-101 and ALD-
103 are historical control studies describing disease progression and neurological decline in untreated 
CALD patients or allo-HSCT treated patients.   
The ongoing pivotal open-label, single-arm, multi-site study ALD-102 enrolled male subjects ≤17 
years with ‘early CALD’ (defined as having contrast enhancement on brain MRI (GdE+), the MRI score 
Loes 0.5-9 and NFS ≤1) and without an available matched sibling donor. This study used busulfan and 
cyclophosphamide as conditioning treatment. The study population is divided into the Initial cohort 
(N=17), mainly used for the primary endpoint and success criterion calculation, and the Overall cohort 
with all enrolled subjects (N=32), used in all other endpoints. At the time of data cut-off for study ALD-
102 (17 Jan 2020), 23 subjects in the overall cohort had reached the month 24 end of study or had 
withdrawn from the study. The primary endpoint of the main studies was proportion of subjects that 
were alive and free from major functional disabilities (MDF) at 24 months (MFD-free survival), with the 
6 major functional disabilities defined as complete loss of volunteer movement, wheelchair 
dependence, tube feeding, total incontinence, cortical blindness, and loss of communication. In 
addition to experiencing any MFDs or death, the following events were also considered as a failure to 
meet the primary efficacy endpoint: requirement for rescue cell administration or an allo-HSCT, 
withdrawal from study, or lost to follow-up by Month 24. Secondary endpoints included overall 
survival, NFS, Loes score, and being free from contrast enhancement (GdE-) at Month 24. Exploratory 
endpoints included neuropsychological tests, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) score, Global 
Assessment Scores, and pharmacodynamic endpoints: Vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood 
cells, Percent of peripheral blood cells expressing ALDP, change from Baseline to Month 24 in VLCFA 
levels in fasting serum. 
The ongoing supportive open-label, single-arm, multi-site study ALD-104 enrolled male subjects ≤17 
years with early CALD (defined as GdE+, Loes ≤9 and NFS ≤1) and without an available matched 
sibling donor. This study used busulfan and fludarabine (instead of cyclophosphamide) as conditioning 
treatment. At the time of data cut-off for MAA submission, 13 subjects had been treated, but none had 
reached the month 24 end of study. No efficacy results are presented from this study at this stage, 
only PD data and safety results. The endpoints were the same for this study as for ALD-102.  
The ongoing supportive non-interventional long-term follow-up study LTF-304 enrols all subjects that 
have concluded their participation in the two main studies (ALD-102 and 104) and continues to follow 
these subjects up to 15 years after Skysona treatment. At the time of data cut-off, 21 patients from 
study ALD-102 had enrolled in the LTF-304 study, with a median (min, max) duration of follow-up of 
56.44 (22.1, 70.7) months after drug product infusion. This study provides some maintenance of 
efficacy results and long-term safety. 
The concurrent control study ALD-103 was a prospective and retrospective data collection study to 
evaluate outcomes in males ≤17 years treated with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation

(allo-HSCT) for CALD. The study included in total 59 subjects. The subpopulation (N=27) TPES (Strictly 
ALD-102-Eligible Transplant Population) fulfilled the inclusion criteria from studies ALD-102 and 
ALD-104 (defined as GdE+, Loes ≤9 and NFS ≤1) and was used for comparison with Skysona 
treatment. From the TPES subgroup, two subgroups were defined based on donor type: subjects with a 
matched sibling donor (MSD, N=10), or without a matched sibling donor (NMSD, N=17). 
The retrospective, multi-centre historical control study ALD-101 collected data on natural course of 
disease in untreated patients or effects of allo-HSCT from boys 3-15 years old with a diagnosis of 
symptomatic CALD and a Loes score of >0 and <15 and at least 2 years follow-up. The study included 
72 untreated subjects and 65 subjects who received allo-HSCT. These results were used for obtaining 
benchmarks for Skysona, in particular to provide survival data from an untreated cohort. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal study ALD-102, the proportion of patients alive and free from loss of communication, 
cortical blindness, tube feeding,  total incontinence, wheelchair dependence, complete loss of voluntary 
movement (24 MFD-free survival) was 15/17 (88.2%, 95% CI: 63.6, 98.5) in the Initial cohort and 
20/23 (87.0%, 95% CI: 66.4, 97.2) in the Overall cohort. The ‘success criterion’ was based upon 
having a lower 95% CI of >50.0% for the endpoint of Month 24 MFD-free survival for the Initial Cohort 
(N = 17). This was based on comparison of the primary efficacy endpoint results to a clinically 
meaningful benchmark (study ALD-101 untreated cohort and published data). Since the lower 95% CI 
was above 50% (63.6%) for the initial cohort, the ‘success criterion’ for efficacy was met. In study 
ALD-101, only 1 patient in the untreated control cohort fulfilled the eligibility criteria in the ALD-102 
study (i.e. GdE+, Loes 0.5-9, NFS≤1), which prevented comparisons with an exactly matching 
untreated subgroup. However, other subgroups fulfilling the criteria partially confirm that the 2-year 
(MFD-free) survival is low in the untreated CALD patient. As an example, the untreated cohort in study 
ALD-101 who were GdE+ (N=21) had a 2-year MFD-free survival of 29% from the first GdE+ brain 
MRI scan. In study ALD-101, the overall 5-year survival from CALD diagnosis was 55% in the overall 
(N=72) untreated cohort. Based on the long-term experience from allo-HSCT treatment of CALD, being 
the current standard of care, these limitations of comparability with an untreated cohort are acceptable 
and the short- and mid-term benefit of Skysona treatment over no treatment is considered 
established. 
In study ALD-103, the allo-HSCT MSD (matched sibling donor) subgroup (N=9) had an 88.9% (95% 
CI:51.8, 99.7) Month 24 MFD-free survival, whereas the subgroup without a matched sibling donor 
(NMSD, N=9) had 66.7%  (95% CI: 29.9, 92.5) Month 24 MFD-free survival. 
The proportion of GdE- MRI scans at Month 24 was 81% in 21 evaluable subjects (95% CI: 58.1, 94.6) 
in study ALD-102. In the study ALD-103 TPES population, the corresponding proportion was 100% 
(95%CI: 75.3, 100.0) among the 13 evaluable subjects.  
The proportion of subjects experiencing a stable NFS (NFS <=4 without an increase of >3 points from 
Baseline) at month 24 was 95.7% (95% CI: 78.1, 99.9) in 23 evaluable subjects in study ALD-102. In 
the study ALD-103 TPES population, the corresponding proportion was 100% (95%CI: 73.5, 100.0) 
among the 12 evaluable subjects.  
The proportion of subjects experiencing a stable Loes score (≤9 or not increased by ≥6 points from 
Baseline) at month 24 was 76.2% (95% CI: 52.8, 91.8) in 21 evaluable subjects in study ALD-102. In 
the study ALD-103 TPES population, the corresponding proportion was 92.3% (95% CI: 64.0, 99.8) in 
13 evaluable subjects. The few (n=4) subjects with a baseline Loes score ≥ 4.5 had a greater 
worsening of Loes score (+7.5, vs +1.0) and Performance IQ (-23 vs -2.5) from baseline to month 24 
than subjects with a baseline Loes score of <4.5 (n=28).

EMA/332184/2021  
Page 127/136 
 
Performance IQ for all subjects in ALD-102 show that most subjects remained within the normal IQ 
range of 100 ± 15 points (i.e. 85-115 points). A few subjects (n=2) had a baseline IQ below 70 and 
stayed below 70 after treatment. A few (n=2) started at a baseline IQ of above 70 and decreased to 
below 70 after treatment.  
In peripheral blood, PK/PD parameters including VCN, ALDP+ cells and reductions of VLCFAs are 
persisting over longer time follow up, although reductions are seen over time. The median % change in 
the VLCFA C26:0 LysoPC from baseline to Month 24 was -20% (min, max: -59, +94) in 20 evaluable 
subjects in study ALD-102. In the study ALD-103 TPES population, the corresponding % change was -
61% (min, max: -75, +5), albeit as measured in only 5 evaluable subjects. The reductions of VLCFA 
seen after Skysona and allo-HSCT treatment do not normalise VLCFAs to normal values seen in healthy 
men, but rather towards the range of female carriers. 
From the ongoing long-term follow-up study LTF-304, efficacy data from the first 21 subjects enrolled 
showed that efficacy was generally maintained during the reported follow-up period of 56.44 (22.1, 
70.7) months. During their follow-up in LTF-304, none of the 21 subjects had developed MFDs or died. 
In study LTF-304, 3 subjects had a resolution of their GdE+ whereas 1 subject developed GdE+, 3 
subjects had increased their NFS by 1 point, and Loes score was generally stable over time beyond 
Month 24. In comparison, MFD-free survival was further decreased in subjects treated with allo-HSCT 
in study ALD-103, in which it stabilised only from Month 36. Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimated Month 
36 MFD-free survival was 90.3% (95% CI: 72.9, 96.8) in ALD-102/LTF-304 vs 74.1% (28.9, 93.0) for 
the TPES-103 MSD subgroup and 58.8% (27.5, 80.4) for the TPES-103 NMSD subgroup. The worse 
MFD-free survival at month 36 in the allo-HSCT subgroups were related to immuno‑incompatibility 
between donor and recipient, i.e. GvHD and second allo-HSCT due to graft rejection, and not to 
disease progression. 
From the latest data cut-off for the MAA, 51 subjects have been followed for a median (min, max) 
29.11 (0.1, 82.7) months and a total of 137.1 patient years. In studies ALD-102/LTF-304, the median 
(min, max) duration of follow-up was 38.59 (13.4, 82.7) months. Nearly half of subjects (20/51) have 
been followed for at least 3 years, with 11 subjects followed for at least 5 years. In study ALD-104, the 
median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 8.64 (0.1, 16.8) months and only 8 subjects had 
completed their Month 12 visits.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The methodological limitations that arise from the design of the studies are associated with general 
difficulties to design and conduct studies in rare diseases with limited patient populations, with few or 
inadequate treatment options as is the case with CALD. These limitations, in terms of small sample 
sizes, no concurrent comparator arm, and use of external controls, were all acknowledged during the 
PRIME development discussions. Limitations of the study designs allow the interpretation of results for 
descriptive purpose only. Selection of endpoints presented in the SmPC section 5.1 is not based on 
statistical grounds but on the clinical relevance of the obtained results. 
The maintenance of efficacy over longer time than 60-80 months is currently unknown. This will be 
followed in the two long-term follow-up studies LTF-304 and REG-502, which are considered key to the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the medicinal product. 
The efficacy of Skysona after the alternative conditioning treatment of busulfan and fludarabine as in 
study ALD-104 is currently also unknown, since this study is ongoing and the timepoint for the primary 
endpoint MFD-free survival has not been reached yet for any of the patients. Further data are being 
collected to address this in studies ALD-104 and LTF-304.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The Transplant Population (TP) consisted of subjects who received Skysona infusion or allo-HSCT in 
each study. 
In TP-102/104, all subjects followed to at least Rel Day 43 (with Day 1 defined as the day of drug 
product infusion) had successful neutrophil engraftment (NE), with a median (min, max) NE on Rel Day 
13 (11, 41). In TP-103, 53/59 (89.8%) subjects achieved primary NE, with a median (min, max) NE on 
Rel Day 17 (12, 36). No primary or secondary NE failure was observed in evaluable TP-102/104 
subjects. Overall, 43/45 subjects achieved platelet engraftment (PE) by Rel Day 60.  
In comparison, primary or secondary NE failure was experienced by 10/38 (26.3%) evaluable subjects 
by Month 24 in the allo-HSCT study TP-103, all of whom were NMSD subjects. In TP-103, 12 of 59 
subjects were not evaluable for PE by Month 24 because they had primary or secondary engraftment 
failure or died. The 47 evaluable subjects all had successful PE, with median (min, max) PE occurring 
on Rel Day 26 (13, 67). 
Updated analyses that also included all treated patients were consistent and showed that 49 of 51 
Skysona treated subjects (96.1%) achieved NE compared to 89.8% in TP-103; 2 subjects from Study 
ALD-104 had not yet achieved NE or been followed to at least Rel Day 43. Most subjects treated with 
eli-cel, 47/51 (92.2%) subjects, achieved PE, compared to 47/59 (79.7%) subjects treated with allo-
HSCT. Four subjects in Study ALD-104 had not yet achieved PE or been followed for at least 24 
months. 
Two subjects in Study ALD-104 had ongoing SAEs of pancytopenia but were clinically stable with no 
further need for platelet supportive treatments.  
Updated results for clinical laboratory evaluations showed severe depletion of neutrophils and platelets 
during and after conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide (ALD-102) and busulfan and 
fludarabine (ALD-104), respectively, in particular, as intended, initially. During the >M12 to M24 
period, 4/38 (10.5%) subjects experienced a potentially clinically significant (PCS) low leukocyte result 
(<4.0 x 109/L), 3/38 (7.9%) subjects experienced a potentially clinically significant PCS low neutrophil 
result (<1.0 x 109/L), and 1/38 (2.6%) subject experienced a PCS low platelet result ≤75 x109/L). 
After Rel Day 100, 15.6% of subjects had any Grade 3 or higher cytopenia, including decreased 
platelet count (8.9%), decreased neutrophil count (11.1%), and decreased haemoglobin (0%). 
Prolonged Cytopenias’ has been characterised as an Important Identified Risk and updates to section 
4.4 of the SmPC have been added. 
In TP-102/104, almost all subjects experienced TEAEs that were attributable to mobilisation/apheresis. 
Frequently reported PTs included hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia, nausea, vomiting, anaemia, and 
bone pain. Also, subjects frequently experienced TEAEs consistent with the effects of conditioning. 
A similar TEAE pattern was observed in TP-103. However, a higher percentage of subjects experienced 
≥ Grade 3 TEAEs of infection attributed to conditioning in TP-103 (16/59 [27.1%]) as compared to TP-
102/104 (2/45 [4.4%]). 
No evaluable subjects (0/31) in TP-102 experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD by 
Month 24, compared to 26/50 (52%) subjects in TP-103, 3/11 (30%) in the MSD group and 23/48 
(57.5%) in the NMSD group. An updated analysis for the entire TP showed no subjects treated with 
Skysona (TP-102/104) experienced either acute (≥ Grade II) or chronic GVHD as compared to 26/59 
(44.1%) subjects who received allo-HSCT in TP-103. For TPES-103 the percentage was 10/27 (37.0%) 
accordingly.

There were differences in the TESAE profiles of TP-102/104 and TP-103 illustrative of the need for 
post-transplant immunosuppression in allo-HSCT recipients vs autologous eli-cel recipients. 
The proportion of subjects with serious infections was more than 2-fold higher in TP-103 than in TP-
102/104 (22/59 [37.3%] vs 7/45 [15.6%], respectively), and the number of serious infection events 
was more than 5-fold higher (47 events vs 8 events, respectively). Many serious infections in TP-103 
were opportunistic (14 SAEs), reflective of the subjects’ chronically immunocompromised state, while 1 
serious opportunistic infection was reported in TP-102/104 (Cystitis viral). The majority of TESAE 
infections (38/47 events) in TP-103 were reported in 16 subjects in the NMSD subgroup.  
There were no TESAEs reported in the Vascular disorders SOC for TP-102/104. However, 7/59 (11.9%) 
subjects in TP-103 experienced 8 TESAEs in this SOC, with 6 of these 7 subjects in the NMSD 
subgroup. Two subjects had serious events of hypertension, a known consequence of 
immunosuppressants, and 4 subjects had 4 events that were thrombotic (e.g., cerebral infarction, 
deep vein thrombosis, thrombosis, and veno-occlusive disease).  
There were no TESAEs related to autoimmunity in TP-102/104; there was one reported ongoing SAE of 
transverse myelitis in Study ALD-104 but a causal relation to elicel was considered unlikely. 
2 subjects in TP-103 experienced 3 TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator. One NMSD 
subject experienced a TESAE of Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and an MSD subject experienced 2 
TESAEs attributed to autoimmunity by the Investigator, Haemolytic anaemia and encephalopathy.  
One death (1/45, 2.2%) was reported in TP-102/104 and a second subject died after receiving allo-
HSCT off study. None of the deaths was considered related to eli-cel.  
In comparison, 15/59 (25.4%) subjects died in TP-103 (12 after first allo-HSCT and 3 after second 
allo-HSCT), 9 of whom had transplant-related mortality (TRM). Thirteen of the 15 deaths were 
reported in NMSD subjects.  
As of the updated Q4 2020 cut-off date, no subjects experienced GVHD or underwent a second stem 
cell transplantation. Seven SAEs in 4 subjects were reported in the initial MAA, none of which were 
attributed to eli-cel. There were 5 subjects who reported new TESAEs as of the new data cut. In 
addition, the applicant reported 5 new (additional) SAEs as Late Breaking Information. Overall, 6 of 
these new SAEs related to serious events of infection/pyrexia/neutropenia and 4 events related to 
seizures. Adding these late-breaking events, the proportion of subjects with SAEs of infection seems to 
be similar for both the ALD-102 and ALD-104 studies.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data from the ongoing study ALD-104, which utilised a different conditioning regimen, were 
particularly limited at this stage and while the available data indicate comparable findings it is 
therefore not yet known whether the use of different lymphodepleting agents (cyclophosphamide vs. 
fludarabine) is an important extrinsic factor in eli-cel treated subject safety.  
Long-term safety data are still very limited. At the time of the interim data cut, there were no AEs of 
interest attributable to the use of an LVV for the ex vivo transduction of autologous cells, i.e. no 
detection of replication of competent lentivirus (RCL), or malignancy. However, one subject (2011) in 
the ongoing Study LTF-304 who received eli-cel in Study ALD-102 and one subject (2208) in Study 
ALD-104 have developed a predominant clone. The two genes most frequently identified with IS in the 
study population are SMG6 and MECOM and both subjects had an IS in the MECOM gene. Transcription 
analysis studies indicate increased MECOM expression, the mechanism of which and possible clinical 
significance in terms of risk for malignancy are currently unclear.

Recently provided (31 March 2021) updated information on Subject 2011 confirmed persistence of this 
predominant clone at the Year 6 evaluation for this subject (January 2021). The subject is clinically 
stable, with normal haemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell count and his previous mild 
neutropenia has resolved. 
Cases of haematologic malignancies due to insertional oncogenesis following gene therapy have been 
reported to occur with retroviral vectors but not the modified LVV to date.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The sought indication is: ‘Skysona is indicated for the treatment of early cerebral 
adrenoleukodystrophy in patients less than 18 years of age, with an ABCD1 genetic mutation, and for 
whom a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donor is not 
available (see section 5.1).’  
The target population is paediatric patients with CALD. In the clinical studies, males 4-14 years have 
been treated with Skysona. In addition, a few female cases have been described in the literature, and 
these are believed to have the same disease characteristics as the males, and thus the indication 
should include both sexes. The typical age for onset of MRI signs of demyelinisation and development 
of cerebral symptoms is 2-12 years, but there are rare cases with onset in children as young as 1 year 
and also in adolescents with the same disease characteristics as in children. Thus, patients younger 
than 3 years of age have not yet been treated with eli-cel; however, it is clear from literature on 
allogeneic and autologous transplantation that  patients can effectively and safely undergo the required 
apheresis, conditioning, and infusion from the age of 6 months. In addition, data from 3 subjects ≤3 
years of age in Study ALD-103 revealed prompt neutrophil engraftment with MFD-free survival at 
Month 24. No lower age cut-off for the Indication is needed since the clinical diagnosis of CALD 
including MRI detection of demyelination and neurologic function tests is age-limiting in itself. No child 
with a diagnosis of early CALD and without an available matched sibling donor should be excluded from 
treatment.  As newborn screening becomes more available and earlier diagnosis of cerebral 
manifestations is possible, these patients will benefit from neurologic disease stabilisation at the 
earliest signs of brain damage. For the upper age cut-off, it is considered that adolescents have the 
same disease characteristics as children, whereas the rare adult patients with CALD have somewhat 
different disease characteristics, often with psychiatric problems, and CALD in adults may be 
superimposed on adrenomyeloneuropathy. Adults have not been included in the studied population. 
Thus, it is considered that the upper age cut-off of less than 18 years is appropriate. In summary, it is 
considered that efficacy may be extrapolated from the studied population to the intended target 
population. 
Efficacy 
MFD-free survival, a direct clinical observation of neurologic function, shows a compelling effect of eli-
cel, with clinically meaningful results. NFS and neuropsychological testing, additional direct clinical 
observations of neurologic functions, show that most patients have minimal to no functional or 
cognitive decline, consistent with stabilisation of neurologic disease. MRI imaging biomarkers (Loes 
scores) reinforce these clinical observations.  
A variability of efficacy has been noted in the comparison of subgroups with higher or lower Loes score 
than 4.5 at baseline. The few (n=4) subjects with a baseline Loes score ≥ 4.5 had a greater worsening 
of Loes score (+7.5, vs +1.0) and Performance IQ (-23 vs -2.5) from baseline to month 24 than 
subjects with a baseline Loes score of <4.5 (n=28). A sentence is included in the SmPC 5.1 to inform

the physician that patients with a higher MRI disease burden in terms of demyelination (and measured 
as Loes scores) tend to have a less favourable outcome. However, it is considered that the benefit-risk 
balance is positive for the entire studied patient population. 
The primary endpoint MFD-free survival is considered a clinically relevant endpoint to capture survival 
without development of major disabilities arising from the rapid progression of cerebral demyelination. 
Given the poor prognosis in untreated CALD, eli-cel treatment is clearly superior to no treatment. In 
addition, the Month 24-MFD-free survival after eli-cel appears slightly superior than after allo-HSCT 
without a matched sibling donor (i.e. the NMSD subgroup of study ALD-103) and similar to that of allo-
HSCT with a matched sibling donor (i.e. the MSD subgroup of study ALD-103). 
After allo-HSCT, even when the donor is a matched sibling donor, there is a risk of engraftment failure 
and acute or chronic GvHD, which led to a decrease in the month 36 overall survival for the allo-HSCT 
MSD subgroup due to immunity-related death (chronic GvHD in at least one subject). Accordingly, eli-
cel seems to offer a clinically meaningful advantage over allo-HSCT. For the subgroup of patients who 
do not have an available matched sibling donor (NMSD), i.e. the intended target population for 
Skysona, eli-cel offers a clear advantage in terms of MFD-free survival up to month 48 after treatment 
with an MFD-free survival of 90% for eli-cel and 59% for the allo-HSCT subgroup NMSD.  
In addition to MFD-free survival data, neuropsychological data show a stabilisation of performance IQ 
for the majority of treated subjects, which shows that cognitive functions are preserved. The 
neuropsychological test results add to the whole picture of disease stabilisation after treatment for the 
majority of the patients. Clinical benefits are supported by pharmacodynamic endpoints showing the 
presence of integrated vector sequences (vector copy number, VCN) and the expression of the 
transgene (%ALDP+ cells), showing persistence of transduced haematopoietic stem cells over many 
years. Disease stabilisation is not immediate, but rather happens approximately one to two years after 
treatment, consistent with observations from allo-HSCT. 
In summary, results for the primary endpoint MFD-free survival at month 24 have been provided for 
30 Skysona-treated patients from the pivotal study ALD-102, exceeding the pre-specified benchmark 
for untreated patients and in line with the results from studies ALD-101 and ALD-103 on allo-HSCT 
treated patients with a matched sibling donor. In addition, performance IQ data show that cognitive 
functions are preserved in the majority of treated patients. 
The effect is durable for up to 5-6 years, as shown by sustained MFD-free survival, stable NFS and 
cognition over time over follow up. At the latest data cut-off, 51 subjects have been followed for a 
median (min, max) 29.11 (0.1, 82.7) months. In the pivotal study ALD-102 followed by the long-term 
follow up study LTF-304, the median (min, max) duration of follow-up was 38.59 (13.4, 82.7) months. 
Nearly half of subjects (20/51) have been followed for at least 3 years, with 11 subjects followed for at 
least 5 years.  
It is concluded that the efficacy results are considered sufficiently characterised for a full approval of 
the sought indication, which excludes patients with an available matched sibling donor (MSD).  
Safety 
Similar to allo-HSCT, treatment with eli-cel is preceded by significant procedural and medical 
interventions, including haematopoietic stem cell collection and myeloablative conditioning. Thus, in 
general, these risks of eli-cel are expected to be in line with the safety profile known to be associated 
with these procedures, and be reflected in the SmPC, including a description of which conditioning 
regimen was used in the pivotal study ALD-102. However, given that eli-cel consists of autologous 
transduced cells, this treatment compares favourably over allo-HSCT for subjects without a matched 
sibling donor.

Currently, data on the clinical effects only exist for patients treated in study ALD-102. In study ALD-
104, which started later, a different conditioning regimen of busulfan and fludarabine is used, and 
there have been two cases of pancytopenia and a possible tendency for later platelet engraftment in 
this study. Apart from this, the safety profile between the two conditioning regimens appear similar 
and the final results of this study will be submitted in accordance to the RMP. 
Eli-cel treated patients, as opposed to allo-HSCT treated patients, did not suffer from Graft-versus-
host-disease (GvHD) after treatment as compared to 26/59 (44.1%) subjects who received allo-HSCT 
in TP-103. Based on the entire TP population, 49 of 51 eli-cel treated subjects (96.1%) achieved 
neutrophil engraftment compared to 53 of 59 (89.8%) of allo-HSCT patients. No subjects treated with 
eli-cel experienced either primary or secondary neutrophil engraftment failure (compared to 10/59 
(16.9%) subjects treated with allo-HSCT). Most subjects treated with eli-cel, 47/51 (92.2%) subjects, 
achieved platelet engraftment at the time of the data cut-off date, compared to 47/59 (79.7%) 
subjects treated with allo-HSCT.  
One death (1/45, 2.2%) was reported in TP-102/104 and a second subject died after receiving allo-
HSCT off study. None of these deaths was considered related to eli-cel.  In comparison, 15/59 (25.4%) 
subjects died in TP-103 (12 after first allo-HSCT and 3 after second allo-HSCT), 9 of whom had 
transplant-related mortality (TRM). Thirteen of the 15 deaths were reported in subjects without a 
matching sibling donor. 
Thus, the current safety data seem favourable in the context of the intended population. 
After autologous HSCT with lentiviral vector-based gene transfer, there are long-term uncertainties to 
be addressed relating to efficacy and safety, e.g. potential loss of efficacy due to loss of the transgene 
and insertional oncogenesis.  
Formation of dominant clones has been detected in two subjects and the enrichment in the overall 
population in MECOM insertions has raised concerns with regards to the risk of insertional oncogenesis 
and the overall benefit-risk balance of Skysona. Transcription analysis of the affected subjects reveals 
dysregulation of the MECOM gene, resulting in increased levels of a subset of MECOM transcripts, the 
mechanism of which and clinical relevance is currently not clear. Recently provided (31 March 2021) 
updates one subject confirmed persistence of this predominant clone at the Year 6 evaluation. Both 
subjects continue to be clinically stable with no evidence of malignancy. 
While the applicant is suggesting that is unlikely that the MNDU3 promoter is directly controlling 
MECOM expression, this is the most plausible explanation in line what has previously been reported for 
X-CGD and Wiskott Aldrich clinical trials. The position of the integration of the two dominant clones in 
two subjects is in the same region of MECOM (intron 2) of dominant IS in patients with X-CGD and 
Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome that eventually developed AML after 2-3 years from the initial clonal 
dominance. Internal viral promoters have been described in preclinical models to influence expression 
of nearby genes even when placed internally in self-inactivating vectors. On the other hand, X-CGD 
and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome may carry additional intrinsic risk factors as compared to X-ALD cells. 
Thus, it is possible that these dominant clones will remain benign, such as in most cases of clonal 
haematopoiesis in aging, without evolving in leukaemia. 
The potential risk of insertional oncogenesis remains, however, and will need to be handled in the RMP.   
Current risk mitigations included in the SmPC 4.4 include at least annual monitoring for 
myelodysplasia, lymphoma or leukaemia with full blood counts. This appears to be appropriate.  
In addition, ISA monitoring will continue in the ongoing and planned clinical studies. The current data 
are not sufficient for evaluating the long-term safety including any potential malignancies related to 
the therapy. Accordingly, there is a need for comprehensive post-approval safety data.

The ongoing long-term follow-up study LTF-304 together with the planned post-authorisation PAES-
study REG-502 will follow eli-cel treated subjects for up to 15 years post treatment.  
The applicant’s plan to generate additional real-world clinical evidence in a post-approval setting, 
utilising the EBMT registry as the main data source for Study REG-502 has been previously discussed 
(most recently EMA/CHMP/SAWP/140510/2020). There are currently no established and active national 
disease CALD/ALD registries in existence that would fulfil the regulatory expectations for post-
marketing commitments. In view of the current state of development of the registry study design and 
lack of alternative existing disease-based registries, this is acceptable.  
However, it would be important to ensure that all necessary documents and procedures will be 
established in a timely manner so that these requirements will be met and allow the study conduct to 
get all the information required without delay.  
In general, the proposed Pharmacovigilance activities appear to be appropriate and proportionate to 
the risks to be addressed. 
Thus, the submitted data is considered appropriate to recommend a approval for the proposed 
indication, together with the obligation to perform two long-term follow-up studies LTF-304 and REG-
502. In addition, the applicant committed to provide long term follow up data from the ongoing clinical 
studies ALD-102 and ALD-104.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CAT review of the available data, the CAT considers that elivaldogene autotemcel is a 
new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.  
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CAT/CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0290/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.
