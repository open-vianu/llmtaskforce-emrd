1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration GmbH submitted on 8 October 2021 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ronapreve through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
A combination pack request was submitted to the Agency on 13th November 2020. In accordance with 
Eudralex, Notice to Applicants, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Section 5.5, "In very exceptional circumstances, 
which must be considered on a case by case basis, the marketing of distinct medicinal products in the 
same package may be indispensable for public health reasons. Such reasons cannot be related to 
convenience or commercial purposes". Further to consultation with ETF on 18th December 2020, the 
CHMP endorsed via written procedure, the outcome of the review process that the proposed 
combination pack was considered indispensable for public health, in order to facilitate patient access to 
the medicinal product in the current pandemic situation. The European Commission has been informed 
of this outcome and endorsed the acceptance of the combination pack in the context of the Covid-19 
emergency situation, stressing that the studies to support co-formulation shall be accelerated, and the 
progress of these ongoing studies must be reported to the EMA. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
- Treatment of COVID-19 in patients aged 12 years and older who do not require supplemental oxygen 
and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
- Prevention of COVID-19 in individuals aged 12 years and older. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included the EMA Decisions 
P/0347/2021 and P/0348/2021 on the agreement of paediatric investigation plans (PIPs). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIPs P/0347/2021 and P/0348/2021 were not yet 
completed as some measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in clusters of patients in the city of 
Wuhan, China. A novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus – severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – was identified in these patients, and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 
infection was later designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020) (Zhu, 2020). Millions of SARS-CoV-2 infections have been confirmed 
worldwide, and the rapidly spreading, worldwide outbreak has prompted the WHO to declare COVID-19 
a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 7 June 2021, over 172 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally by the 
WHO with the cumulative prevalence of 2331 cases per 100,000 population.  
In the WHO European region, over 54.5 million cases were confirmed so far with a prevalence of 5963 
cases per 100,000 population.  
Older adults are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. More than 80% of COVID-19 deaths 
occur in people over age 65, and more than 95% of COVID-19 deaths occur in people older than 45. 
Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have put various groups of people at increased risk 
of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, including many racial and ethnic minority groups and people 
with disabilities. A meta-analysis of 50 studies (42 were from the USA and 8 from the United Kingdom) 
reported that individuals from Black [Relative Risk (RR): 2.02; 95% CI 1.67-2.44)] and Asian (RR: 
1.50; 95% CI 1.24-1.83) ethnicities had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection compared to white 
individuals (Sze et al. 2020). Chronic underlying health conditions also place patients at increased risk 
for developing severe disease. These include cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; Down Syndrome; heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or 
cardiomyopathies; immunocompromised state (weakened immune system); liver disease; obesity (body 
mass index [BMI] of 30 kg/m2 or higher but < 40 kg/m2); severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2); 
pregnancy; sickle cell disease; cerebrovascular disease; and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (ECDC High Risk 
Groups; CDC People with Certain Medical Conditions). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped RNA viruses and are important human and animal pathogens. Two 
coronaviruses have previously been identified as zoonotic infections which have adapted to humans and 
caused severe respiratory illnesses with high fatality: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 1 
(SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) is a class I transmembrane envelope protein that forms a 
homo-trimer and mediates binding, fusion, and viral entry into host cells. The S protein is essential for 
virus infectivity and is the main target of the humoral immune response, as demonstrated by serology 
analysis of recovered COVID-19 patients (Long, 2020). The S protein mediates binding to the host 
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in membrane fusion and entry of the virus 
into susceptible cells (Hoffmann, 2020).  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 14/147
 
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplet 
transmission (Lai, 2020) (Lewis, 2020). A high background rate of lateral transmission has been 
observed in households with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infected individual quarantining alongside other 
household members (Madewell, 2020). Compared to other betacoronavirus infections, the incubation 
period of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., time before symptoms occur) has features that complicate the 
control of virus transmission: the period is highly variable (range 2 to 14 days) and it is often 
characterized by high viral loads and viral shedding (Ellington, 2020). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and prognosis 
The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit relatively mild symptoms or are 
asymptomatic (Hu, 2020) (Oran, 2020), suggesting that most cases can be managed in an outpatient 
setting. However, a subset of infections leads to hypoxemia and other serious respiratory conditions 
that require hospitalization or can be fatal (Guan, 2020) (Richardson, 2020) (Wu, 2020). Infection is 
more likely to lead to hospitalization among patients with pre-existing risk factors or comorbidities, such 
as older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic lung disease (CDC, 2021) 
(Lighter, 2020). Such risk factors also increase the likelihood of death following hospitalization (Wu, 
2020). There is also a subset of patients, approximately 10% to 35%, who recover from the acute 
SARS-CoV-2 infection but experience persistent symptoms, which occur beyond 4 weeks from the initial 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis (Greenhalgh, 2020) (Tenforde, 
2020). 
Studies among hospitalized patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby, 2020) (Westblade, 2020). Community-
based studies in non-hospitalized patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral load across both 
adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung, 2021). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, there is no approved outpatient treatment for COVID-19 in the EU. The mainstay for COVID-
19 prevention is vaccination, but no therapeutic is approved for acute prevention of unvaccinated or 
partly vaccinated individuals with a known or likely exposure and there is no non-vaccine-based 
intervention for acute and chronic prevention of COVID-19 in populations unlikely to respond to or be 
protected by vaccination, i.e., those with altered immunocompetence such as due to primary or 
secondary immunodeficiencies.  
Clinical management of COVID-19 consists of supportive care, which may include inpatient 
management, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support as required. Prevention 
measures include infection control consisting of widespread vaccination efforts, and non-therapeutic-
based approaches such as quarantining, social distancing, and wearing masks. Veklury (remdesivir) is 
conditionally approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and 
adolescents ≥12 years old and weighing ≥40 kg with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.  
About the product 
Casirivimab and imdevimab are human, IgG1 mAbs that bind simultaneously to the S protein receptor 
binding domain (RBD) and block its interaction with the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
(ACE2). When co-administered as combination therapy, casirivimab and imdevimab treatment is 
anticipated to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with a reduced likelihood of viral escape due to genetic 
mutations. Co-administered casirivimab+imdevimab combination therapy (“casirivimab+imdevimab,” 
also referred to as “REGN10933+REGN10987” or “REGN-COV2” throughout this report) is intended to

substitute or augment for the endogenous antibody response, especially in patients in whom this 
response is delayed or inadequate.  
The combination pack has been considered indispensable for public health by the CHMP and the 
European Commission, in order to facilitate patient access to the medicinal product in the current 
pandemic situation.  
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
- 
Treatment of COVID-19 in patients aged 12 years and older who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
- 
Prevention of COVID-19 in individuals aged 12 years and older. 
For the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, the proposed dosage in adult patients 
and in adolescent patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab 
and 600 mg of imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection. 
For pre-exposure prophylaxis, the proposed initial (loading) dose in adult patients and in adolescent 
patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg is 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of 
imdevimab administered as a single intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection. Subsequent 
doses, administered every 4 weeks, are 300 mg of casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab by 
intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection until prophylaxis is no longer required. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ronapreve, also referred to as REGN-COV2, is a combination pack containing two monoclonal antibodies 
as active substances, casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987).  
Casirivimab and imdevimab are two recombinant human monoclonal antibodies (IgG1κ and IgG1λ 
respectively) with unmodified Fc regions and produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes of the spike 
(S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV 2. This prevents RBD binding to the human 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thereby preventing virus entry into cells. Casirivimab 
and imdevimab were developed for co-administration to minimise the likelihood of virus escape. 
Ronapreve is presented as a solution for injection or infusion in vials: 
- Presentation EU/1/21/1601/001: Two co-packaged single-use vials of 6 mL containing 300 mg of each 
antibody in 2.5 mL (1 vial per antibody). This corresponds to a 300 mg strength and 120 mg/mL 
concentration for each antibody; 
- Presentation EU/1/21/1601/002: Two co-packaged multi-dose vials of 20 mL containing 1332 mg of 
each antibody in 11.1 mL (1 vial per antibody). This corresponds to a 120 mg/mL  strength and 
concentration for each antibody.  
The vials for these two presentations can be used for both intravenous route (concomitant 
administration) and subcutaneous route (consecutive administration). For intravenous use, the syringe 
and needle required for vial withdrawal and the infusion set are provided separately. For subcutaneous 
use, the syringes for administration, the 21-gauge transfer needle (for vial withdrawal) and the 25- or 
27-gauge administration needle are provided separately. 
 
Assessment report

Casirivimab and imdevimab are formulated with commonly used excipients: L-histidine, L-histidine 
monohydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 80, sucrose and water for injections. Ronapreve is 
preservative-free. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 are recombinant monoclonal antibodies (IgG1 isotype) consisting each of 
two disulfide-linked human gamma heavy chains, each covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a 
human kappa light chain (REGN10933) or lambda light chain (REGN10987). Based on the primary 
structure (in the absence of N-linked glycosylation), REGN10933 and REGN10987 possess a molecular 
weight of 145.23 kDa and 144.14 kDa, respectively, taking into account the formation of 16 disulfide 
bonds. There is a single N-linked glycosylation site (Asn300) on each heavy chain, located within the 
constant region in the Fc domain of REGN10933 and REGN10987 molecules. 
The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) within the heavy chain and light chain variable 
domains of REGN10933 and REGN10987 combine to form the binding sites for its target, the receptor 
binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of target cells 
expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but do not mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
The biological and physico-chemical properties have been described in detail. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Manufacture of REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulated active substances is conducted at the following 
locations: 
- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (RNS), Inc., 81 Columbia Turnpike, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA; 
- Roche/Genentech, Inc., 1000 New Horizons Way, Vacaville (VV), CA 95688, USA. 
Both manufacturing sites are multi-product facilities located in the US and are regularly inspected by 
competent authorities.  
EU GMP compliance has been documented for all sites involved. 
The manufacture of the active substances represents a standard manufacturing process for monoclonal 
antibodies. Each antibody is manufactured and formulated independently to produce the formulated active 
substance. In general, the manufacturing processes for the two individual antibodies consist of an identical 
platform seed train, production, and purification process (i.e. identical equipment, same cell culture media 
and chromatography resins). 
The active pharmaceutical ingredients are initially produced in a suspension culture of recombinant CHO 
cells that express either REGN10933 or REGN10987 protein molecules.  
The production process begins with thawing a frozen vial of the REGN10933 or REGN10987 WCB and 
transferring the cells into a shake flask. The cell culture is expanded through a series of seed train 
bioreactors that increase in volume. The contents of the final seed train bioreactor are transferred to the 
production bioreactor containing conditioned medium where the recombinant product is produced and 
secreted into the culture medium. The culture is harvested by a centrifugal separator followed by depth 
and polish filtration. The protein is then purified using a series of packed bed chromatographic and

membrane filtration techniques. Finally, dilution and excipient solutions are added to prepare the 
formulated active substances.  
The formulated active substances produced will be filtered and stored in cryovessels whereas the 
formulated active substance is dispensed and stored in biotainers. Shipping conditions are briefly outlined.  
All successive steps including relevant process parameters and in-process-testing are provided for both 
manufacturing sites. The purpose of each step is clearly stated and detailed description are provided for 
both sites in the respective dossier sections. 
Process parameters were categorised as non-critical (non-CPPs) and critical (CPPs) by assessing their 
impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs). If a parameter is considered to affect a CQA but has little or 
no effect on the CQA within the normal operating range (NOR), and the magnitude of impact on the 
attribute is not significant over the characterised range, the parameter is not considered critical. At both 
sites, CPPs have been identified. 
The Applicant confirmed that any changes to the classifications or control criteria detailed in Section 
3.2.S.2.2, and Section 3.2.S.2.4 will be submitted in post-approval submission variation applications. 
Reprocessing  is currently indicated for both manufacturing sites. The Applicant states this is performed 
according to the protocol. Validation has not been performed yet and would be conducted as concurrent 
validation. Upon the first instance during production of an active substance batch, the respective batch 
will be used for verification at manufacturing scale; product quality and stability will be evaluated 
according to a protocol. The protocol was provided and amended as requested. Conditions are sufficiently 
described and considered acceptable. 
In-process pools may be held for specified times at specified temperatures prior to further processing. 
The acceptable in-process hold conditions are the maximum validated hold times and temperatures 
supported by both biochemical in-process pool hold stability and microbial hold validation. This is 
acceptable.  
Chromatography resins and ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) membranes used in the purification steps 
are dedicated to REGN10933 and REGN10987. Chromatography skids, virus-retentive filtration, and 
tangential flow filtration (TFF) systems are automated. Details on the post-use cleaning and storage of 
the chromatography columns and the tangential flow filters are described. Cleaning and sanitisation 
procedures are sufficiently summarised for both sites. 
A combination of development, prior knowledge, clinical manufacturing experience and process validation 
was used to define the proposed commercial manufacturing process and process controls described in 
Module 3.2.S.2.2. A summary of the prior knowledge and manufacturing experience supporting the IPCs 
for REGN10933 and REGN10987 is provided. Considering the substantial experience of both 
manufacturing sites in manufacturing monoclonal antibodies, the approach is accepted. The proposed 
ranges (proven acceptable ranges (PARs)) and set points for commercial manufacturing as proposed are 
considered appropriate. The Applicant is recommended to provide results of the remaining ongoing small-
scale process characterisation studies conducted to support PARs and update the relevant CTD sections 
following the review of the corresponding data (see Recommendation 1). 
Control of materials

Raw materials used in the manufacture of REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulated active substances are 
listed. There are no raw materials of human origin used during REGN10933 and REGN10987 
manufacturing.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 18/147
 
Non-compendial materials used in the manufacture of REGN10933 and REGN10987 are tested by the 
material manufacturer.  
Source, history and generation of cell substrate 
A detailed description of the source history and generation of the cell substrate is provided giving no 
reason for concern.  
The  REGN10933, REGN10987 expression cell lines were generated. The selected cell lines were used for 
production of REGN10933, REGN10987, respectively, for toxicological and clinical studies. 
The cell banking system employed for REGN10933 and REGN10987 is a standard two-tiered system. 
Identity of MCB and WCB was confirmed via nucleotide sequencing and no evidence of viral or microbial 
contamination was observed. MCB and WCB were further characterised by sequencing, gene copy number, 
heavy chain and light chain gene integration sites, and integrity of the REGN10933 and REGN10987 
transcripts. Cell line stability has been sufficiently demonstrated. The test results are provided and indicate 
the suitability of the MCB and WCB. In addition, the underlying raw data were provided with the original 
study reports.  
A qualification protocol for implementation of future WCBs is described in the dossier. This is accepted. 
Overall, the MCB, WCB, end-of-production and limit-of-in-vitro-cell-age cell banks have been 
appropriately characterised, in line with ICH guidelines. Cell line stability has been sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
IPC tests and limits applied to the cell culture process and purification are summarised for each active 
substance manufacturing site. Depending on criticality, IPCs are tested against defined action limits or 
acceptance criteria.  
Bioburden and bacterial endotoxins sampling is performed throughout the process as IPCs. In addition, 
further IPCs have been defined for each step of the manufacturing process. For the upstream process, 
the maximum total expansion time for the production bioreactor is considered critical at both sites.  
The Applicant states that revisions to the IPC program may occur during the lifecycle of a product in 
accordance with the quality system. Revisions may be prompted by increased process knowledge.  
The Applicant confirmed that any changes to the classifications or control criteria detailed in Section 
3.2.S.2.2, and Section 3.2.S.2.4 will be submitted in post-approval submission variation applications.  
Excursions from acceptance criteria and action limits are addressed within manufacturing site quality 
system. The deviation management system documents quality events and, when required, determines 
the level of investigation based on risk. The deviation management system is used assess product impact, 
and determine root cause assessments, and corrective/preventive actions.  
Process validation 
Process validation was performed individually at the two proposed active substance manufacturing sites. 
The validation of the REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulated active substance manufacturing process 
included process performance qualification (PPQ) batches, extended hold times validation, limit of in 
vitro cell age, column and filter (lifetime, cleaning and storage) validation, medium, feed and buffer 
validation, shipping validation and ongoing process verification. Consecutive PPQ batches were 
manufactured and extended holds were performed for all PPQ batches. All validation criteria were met. 
Extended hold times during manufacturing steps were validated. Shipping validation of the FDS was 
performed.

Manufacturing process development 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 are manufactured using process for IgG molecules (i.e., identical equipment, 
same cell culture media and chromatography resins). The REGN10933 and REGN10987 materials were 
used in animal pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies.  
Initial production occurred in a bioreactor. This material was used during clinical development and 
preclinical studies. 
Phase-appropriate comparability of REGN10933 and REGN10987 lots was evaluated. These studies found 
that the quality attributes, potency, and stability of the REGN10933 and REGN10987 material are 
comparable.  
In order to increase the production capacity, the formulated active substance manufacturing processes 
for REGN10933 and REGN10987 were transferred and scaled up. This process uses the same cell line at 
scale. The manufacturing process follows the same overall process flow. A comparison of the formulated 
active substances manufacturing processes is provided in the dossier. The changes implemented are 
generally considered related to the upscale and additional facility fits. The process was used for emergency 
use procedures. 
Briefly, a scale-appropriate seed train is implemented to support inoculation and protein production in a 
fed batch suspension production bioreactor. A centrifugation step is used to clarify the harvest culture 
fluid. Downstream purification includes chromatography, viral inactivation steps and filtration.  
A comprehensive comparability program has been performed. Preliminary data has been provided during 
previous Rolling Review cycles. With the present submission, the section has been updated with completed 
comparability data and summary of results (e.g. comparison of accelerated stability data, stressed study, 
completed active substance extended characterisation). The comparability assessment is summarised in 
Module 3.2.S.2.6 Manufacturing Process Development. 
In-process, release, and extended characterisation testing were performed on REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 active substances. The results of the in-process testing were compared to acceptance criteria 
and predefined evaluation limits generated from historical data, as defined in the process validation 
protocol. The results from the release testing were evaluated against predefined limits derived from 
historical data from REGN10933 and REGN10987.  
Extended comparative characterisation defined in the comparability plan are summarised in the dossier 
section and the data supporting comparability is provided.   
The Applicant concluded that the quality of the REGN10933 and REGN10987 samples produced from the 
two manufacturing sites is comparable.  
Comparative stability studies under the stress storage condition of 45 °C for 35 days have been conducted. 
Side-by-side stress stability studies demonstrate that the formulated active substance are highly similar.  
Long-term and accelerated stability data are provided. 
Comparability in the context of manufacturing process development for REGN10933 and REGN10987 is 
considered acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure  
Extensive analytical characterisation was performed to provide a detailed understanding of the 
physicochemical properties of each anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein (REGN10933 and REGN10987). Quality 
attributes were all assessed. Post-translational modifications were also examined.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 20/147
 
Binding of REGN10933 and REGN10987 to SARS-COV2-S protein was evaluated using surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) technology (binding to SARS-CoV2 S protein). Results demonstrated that both antibodies 
bind with high affinity to SARS-CoV2 S protein. Binding to human FcRn was also assessed for both 
antibodies. Detailed method descriptions of methods used for characterisation are provided in the dossier.  
Analysis revealed that one of the two heavy chains of REGN10933 and REGN10987 contains N-linked 
glycans predominantly composed of a complex, fucosylated bi-antennary core structure, with 0, 1, or 2 
galactose residues at the glycan chain termini. 
Information on biological characterisation is currently limited to binding to target via SPR technology and 
a high-level summary on Fc mediated biological activity of REGN10933 and REGN10987. Both antibodies 
mediate concentration-dependent ADCC antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) activity but no 
CDC activity.  
Characterisation data (including representative curves) on neutralisation activity of REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 against wild type and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV2 are provided. 
Results from these analytical, biochemical, and biophysical characterisation assays were also used to 
assess comparability of the toxicology and clinical formulated active substance samples for each anti-
SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Overall, the quality of the toxicology and clinical formulated active substance lot 
samples for each anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein appeared highly similar with respect to all quality attributes 
examined. 
Impurities 
Known potential impurities arising from raw materials, the manufacturing process and degradation 
products were assessed.  
All process-related impurities of REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulated active substance manufacturing 
process were demonstrated to either be sufficiently cleared or reduced to quantities that do not exceed 
acceptable daily exposure levels.  
Product-related impurities include   forms, and species. Through manufacturing data and characterisation 
studies, it was demonstrated for both antibodies that product-related impurities are sufficiently controlled 
by the manufacturing process. Additionally, a comprehensive control strategy is in place through the 
release and stability testing programs to ensure product consistency. 
Overall, impurities are well controlled by IPCs, release criteria and removal capacities of the manufacturing 
process.  
Characterisation of REGN10933 and REGN10987 and evaluation of impurities is considered acceptable. 
 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, 
and container closure

Batch Analyses 
Batch information and release data on multiple lots of REGN10933 and REGN10987 are provided. Batch 
release data indicate robust reproducible manufacturing processes. All pre-defined acceptance criteria 
were met.  
In addition, information on preclinical batches is provided. The preclinical lots were used to create the 
initial reference standard for REGN10933 and REGN10987, respectively. 
Reference standard 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 reference standards are used in all routine in-process, release, and stability 
testing. In principle, candidate reference standard material for qualification may originate from any batch 
of GMP produced formulated active substance. 
A history of the reference standard used during development is provided. The initial reference standard 
for REGN10933 and REGN10987 were derived from tox batches. Based on data provided, process 
development material as reference standard for both sites is accepted. 
The current primary reference standards were tested according to the specification in place at the time of 
reference standard qualification, against the respective previous reference standard.  
Results for qualification of the primary and working reference material for REGN10933 and REGN10987 
are considered acceptable. 
Overall, the primary reference standards are considered appropriately characterised in-house primary 
reference materials for REGN10933 and REGN10987. 
Container closure system.  
The material meets Ph. Eur. requirements. Physicochemical testing is performed on the bottle and cap in 
accordance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.2.1, Plastic Containers for Aqueous Solutions for Infusion. The material met 
all required testing acceptance criteria. 
Based on acceptable biocompatibility and physicochemical testing, demonstrated lack of solvent loss and 
gas permeation, acceptable extractable and leachable evaluations, and demonstrated temperature and 
procedural control conducted using the same container closure, the container closure system has been 
demonstrated to be suitable. 
Different container closure systems for the formulated active substances are used at each site but both 
are commonly known from other monoclonal antibody products. This is acceptable. 
Stability 
 
Stability summary and conclusion 
The proposed shelf life for REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances manufactured at both sites is 
based on product-specific data, in conjunction with the Applicant’s extensive platform manufacturing 
experience and product knowledge, as well as long-term stability data from other IgG1 antibodies from 
the Applicant.  
Post-approval stability protocol and stability commitments 
A post-approval stability protocol and commitment are provided.

Little to no degradation is expected in REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products; therefore, 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances are expected to be stable at the long-term storage 
conditions, and the same shelf life is proposed for the active substances as for the finished products. 
Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, the proposed approach to justify REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 active substances shelf life, as well as long-term stability data from other IgG1 antibodies 
from the Applicant, are considered acceptable. 
Shelf life for REGN10933 and REGN10987 active substances is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
Description of the finished product 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products are in an aqueous buffered solution, pH 6.0, containing 
the following compendial excipients: L-histidine and L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate, 
sucrose, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI). The qualitative and quantitative composition in 
excipients is identical for REGN 10933 and REGN10987. Ronapreve formulation does not contain 
preservatives. 
The solution for each vial should be clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale yellow. 
There are two finished product presentations (see above) corresponding to 1332 mg of each antibody in 
20 mL multidose vial (11.1 mL withdrawable volume) and 300 mg of each antibody in 6 mL single-use 
vial (2.5 mL withdrawable volume). The same vial can be used for both infusion and SC routes.  
The two finished product presentations use the same Type I clear glass vial equipped with an 
elastomeric butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal cap with flip-off button. 
Formulation development 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, used in the preclinical toxicology studies to assess safety and tolerability 
in non-human primates following IV infusion and SC injection, were formulated at 120 mg/mL.  
Based on experience gained during previous product development activities, a platform formulation 
approach was used to identify a formulation.   
The results from the accelerated and stress stability studies demonstrated the same main degradation 
pathways for the REGN10933 and REGN10987 formulation.  
In addition, the formulation is compatible with the glass vials and the stoppers; and the formulation 
stability profile indicates acceptable long-term storage stability at 2°C to 8°C.  
There are no overages included in the formula. An overfill is required to ensure that there is adequate 
volume in the vial to provide the required dose.  
Physico-chemical properties are provided. 
The rationale to select the final composition/formulation is sufficiently described and accepted. The 
presented overview of the formulation development is acceptable. The formulation is considered robust. 
Manufacturing process development 
 Initial supplies for Phase I and Phase I/II/III (pivotal) clinical studies were manufactured by filling 
formulated active substances into fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags. Two vial presentations 
were used to supply pivotal clinical studies. There are no differences between the glass vials used to 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 23/147
 
supply clinical studies and the intended commercial glass vials. The same formulation was used 
throughout all finished product manufacturing processes.  
An overview of the clinical and commercial finished product manufacturing processes is provided. 
Information regarding the compatibility of the primary container closure system with the finished 
product solution is provided. 
The finished product manufacturing processes have been designed to ensure adequate product quality. 
No major changes were made between clinical and commercial processes. Acceptance criteria and/or 
action limits of IPCs were based on data acquired throughout development studies and clinical 
manufacturing. All major equipment used in clinical manufacturing remains the same for commercial 
manufacturing. 
Details of the development leading to the commercial finished product manufacturing process and 
process controls, as well as information about single-use (disposable) materials and sterilising filters are 
provided. 
Extractable and leachable studies were performed.  
The extractables identified were chemically similar to compounds that are detectable by the analytical 
methods used to assess potential leachables. Results of the confirmative finished product leachable 
study demonstrate that there are no leachables of toxicological concern associated with the 
manufacturing process. 
In order to expand production capacity for REGN10933 and REGN10987 the finished product 
manufacturing process was transferred to an additional manufacturing site, Roche. Both sites will 
manufacture both presentations of each antibody i.e. 300 mg and 1332 mg. The filling line is a multi-
product filling line previously validated and approved for other monoclonal antibodies. The fill/finish 
processes for REGN10933 and REGN10987 follow the same overall process flow. Differences in the 
processes due to facility fit are summarised in the dossier.  
 The manufacturing process consists of thawing, pooling/mixing, bioburden reduction filtration, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering, capping, tray loading and 100% inspection of filled vials. The filled 
vials are transferred a facility where labelling and secondary packaging takes place. Each monoclonal 
antibody is independently filled into separate vials. Target withdrawable volumes of 2.5 mL or 11.1 mL 
of sterile-filtered finished products are filled into 6 mL or 20 mL vials. The finished product vials are 
stored at 2–8°C. 
Comparability evaluation 
The analytical comparability exercise comprises of in-process, release and stability testing. Extended 
characterisation is not planned for the finished products comparison as attributes tested by extended 
characterisation are not anticipated to be impacted by differences in filling operations. Given the 
comprehensive comparability study performed at the active substance level, the approach for 
demonstrating comparability of REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products is considered acceptable. 
Post-change finished product lots of REGN10933 and REGN10987 are evaluated for comparability.  
Results for the initial comparability assessment of in-process and release data are submitted. 
Comparative stability is ongoing.  
Results for in-process testing for all finished product lots met the established limits demonstrating that 
the REGN10933 and REGN10987 processes operated as intended. In addition, release results for the 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products lots met all acceptance criteria.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 24/147
 
The side-by-side stress (45°C) stability studies indicated that the finished product lots have highly 
similar degradation profiles. 
Overall, comparability evaluation to support the use of REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished product is 
considered satisfactory. 
Container Closure System 
The finished product primary container closure system used at the initial fill site consists of a Type I 
glass vial and a 20 mm elastomeric stopper. Finished product primary container closure system used at

An overview of the currently available product-specific data and the overall approach for determination of 
shelf life is provided. 
In general, the finished product shelf life should be determined in accordance with ICH Q5C guideline 
“Stability testing of biotechnological/biological products”. However, given the current COVID-19 pandemic 
situation, the approach of the Applicant to define a shelf life for REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished 
products is considered appropriately justified and thus, accepted. In addition, the Applicant’s approach 
relates to the draft CHMP toolbox guidance on “scientific elements and regulatory tools to support quality 
data packages for PRIME marketing authorisation applications”. 
The proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2-8°C for REGN10933 and REGN10987 finished products is 
acceptable.  
Photostability studies conducted in accordance with ICH Q1B confirm that the vials should be kept in the 
original carton protected from light. 
In-use stability 
After initial puncture: 
- The medicinal product in the single-use 6 mL vial should be used immediately, any remaining product 
should be discarded. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 27/147
 
- The medicinal product in the multi-dose 20 mL vial, if not used immediately after initial puncture, can 
be stored for 16 hours at room temperature up to 25°C or for no more than 48 hours in a refrigerator 
(2°C to 8°C).  
For IV administration, the solution in vial requires dilution prior to administration, using 0.9% sodium 
chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection. The prepared infusion solution is intended to be used 
immediately. The chemical and physical in-use stability data has been demonstrated for 20 hours at 
room temperature (up to 25°C) and 72 hours at 2°C to 8°C. From a microbiological point of view, the 
prepared infusion solution should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times 
and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 
hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. If 
refrigerated, the intravenous infusion bag should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 
approximately 30 minutes prior to administration. 
For SC administration, the prepared syringes should be administered immediately. The chemical and 
physical in-use stability data has been demonstrated for 24 hours at room temperature (up to 25°C) 
and 72 hours at 2°C to 8°C. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use 
are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C, unless 
preparation has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.  If refrigerated, the syringes 
should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for approximately 10 - 15 minutes prior to 
administration. 
 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
No TSE-risk materials have been identified. Compliance with TSE-Guideline EMEA 410/01 rev03 has been 
demonstrated. 
 
Virus safety

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) is a class I transmembrane envelope protein that forms a 
homo-trimer and mediates binding, fusion, and viral entry into host cells. The S protein is essential for 
virus infectivity and is the main target of the humoral immune response, as demonstrated by serology 
analysis of recovered COVID-19 patients (Long, 2020). The S protein mediates binding to the host 
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in membrane fusion and entry of the virus 
into susceptible cells (Hoffmann, 2020). The S protein is composed of 2 functional subunits: the S1 subunit 
that contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), which binds to ACE2 on host cells, and the S2 subunit, 
which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Walls, 2020). Structural studies have mapped 
the interface between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and results suggest simultaneous binding of 2 
individual S protein trimers to a single ACE2 dimer (Yan, 2020). 
As the S protein is required for viral entry, blockade of its interaction with the ACE2 receptor may offer a 
powerful way to block viral infectivity and spread. Indeed, a vaccine study utilizing the S protein as an 
immunogen has shown prophylactic efficacy in the rhesus macaque model of COVID-19, with a several 
log-fold decrease in viral load versus naïve animals (Yu, 2020). 
The Applicant is developing the high-affinity human IgG1 anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), casirivimab and imdevimab (hereafter 
referred to as  REGN10933 and REGN10987, which bind specifically to the receptor binding domain of the 
spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralize virus infectivity by blocking binding to 
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).  REGN10933 and REGN10987 were developed for co-
administration (referred to as REGN-COV2) to minimize the likelihood of virus escape.  REGN10933 was 
isolated from Regeneron’s VelocImmune® human antibody mouse platform (Macdonald, 2014) (Murphy, 
2014). REGN10987 was isolated from B cells of human donors previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
Please note that besides REGN10933 and REGN10987 additional individual mAbs directed against SARS-
CoV-2 S protein were used throughout the non-clinical program (REGN10989, REGN10993 and 
REGN10943). Results and data presented for these additional mAbs are noted and are partially included 
in the non-clinical assessment report, however, are not evaluated by the assessor for the present rolling 
review procedure for REGN-COV2 (REGN10933 and REGN10987). 
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro binding and primary mode of action (R10933-PH-20155-SR-01V1 R10933-PH-20088-SR-
01V1, R10933-PH-20089-SR-01V1) 
The structural basis for REGN10933 and REGN10987 binding to the target SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding 
domain (RBD) was assessed using cryogenic electron microscopy. Single-particle cryo-EM of the complex 
of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD bound to Fab fragments of REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that the two 
antibodies can simultaneously bind to distinct regions of the RBD (Figure 1).

light chain of REGN 10987. Contact residues are represented as sticks, where red colouring represents 
oxygen and aqua colouring represents nitrogen atoms.  
 
Results from cross-competition studies using SPR technology further confirmed that REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 bind non-overlapping epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Moreover, sequence analysis using 
publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified through mid-August 2020 revealed that the RBD 
residues bound by REGN10933 and REGN10987 are highly conserved regions (i.e.≥99.96% and 
≥99.98%, respectively, at each position across 58,728 SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that were of 
sufficient quality for the analysis). In addition, the Applicant provided and update with more recent data 
demonstrating that the epitopes are highly conserved in currently (as of March 2021) circulating variants. 
The kinetic binding parameters for the interaction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein mAbs with monomeric 
and dimeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD as well as with stabilised, trimerized SARS-CoV-2 S protein were 
determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. Results at 25⁰C are presented in Table 
1.

(summarized in Table 2) was demonstrated for REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 using different 
ELISA formats.

Fc functions 
To understand whether REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 are capable of mediating effector 
function, ADCP activity and ADCC in primary human cell bioassays were assessed utilizing monocyte-
derived phagocytes and natural killer (NK) cells (3 independent donors). Results for the experiments with 
the NK cells are presented in Figure 3.

Furthermore, the ability to mediate CDC of target cells in presence of normal human serum was 
investigated. Results demonstrate that REGN10933, REGN10987, REGN-COV2, and REGN10989 do not 
mediate CDC against Jurkat/hCD20/SARS-CoV-2-S FL or Jurkat/hCD20 cells (data not shown). 
Neutralisation activity(R10933-PH-20091-SR-01V4) 
REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 neutralisation activity against SARS-CoV2 virus and Vesicular 
Stomatitis Virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2-Spike Protein was evaluated using cell-based assay 
formats. Briefly, non-replicating pseudoparticles (pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S, aa 14-1255) or virus (VSV-SARS-
CoV-2-S, aa 1-1255 or SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 isolate) were pre-incubated with either  REGN10933, 
REGN10987, REGN-COV2 or an IgG1 isotype control mAb and added to Vero (VSVs) or Vero E6 (SARS-
CoV-2) cells to assess neutralisation. Vero cell infectivity was detected by utilizing expression of 
fluorescent mNeon reporter (pseudoparticles) or immunostaining with anti-VSV polyclonal antibody 
(virus). Vero E6 cell infectivity by SARS-CoV-2 was detected by a plaque assay.  
REGN-COV2 and the individual mAbs mediate concentration-dependent neutralisation of pVSV-SARS-CoV-
2-S, VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S virus, and SARS-CoV-2 entry into Vero or Vero E6 cells, with IC50 and IC90 
values in the picomolar range (Table 3). 
 
Table 3. Summary of values for REGN10933, REGN10987, REGN-COV2 and REGN-10989 mediating 
neutralisation of viral entry into Vero or Vero E6 cells 
  
 
Neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD variants 
Additional in vitro studies were performed using pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles to evaluate the 
ability of REGN10933, REGN10987, REGN-COV2, and REGN10989 to neutralize putative escape mutants 
identified in vitro under antibody pressure with anti-S protein mAbs (R10933-PH-20100), as well as S 
protein variants identified from preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and publicly available sources of 
SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation. WT SARS-CoV-2 or the S protein variant, D614G, the predominant 
globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus (Yurkovetskiy, 2020), was used as the reference virus to calculate 
fold changes for each variant tested in these assays. Variants located outside the RBD were not evaluated. 
This is acceptable as they will likely not influence the binding and neutralisation activity of REGN-COV2. 
Non-replicating VSV pseudoparticles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants were incubated 
with REGN10933, REGN10987, REGN-COV2, or REGN10989 to assess the capacity of anti-S protein 
antibodies to block pseudoparticle entry into Vero cells. WT SARS-CoV-2 or the S protein variant, D614G, 
was used as the reference virus for these assays.

Results demonstrate that REGN10933, REGN10987, REGN-COV2, and REGN10989 mediate neutralization 
in a concentration-dependent manner (Table 4, R10933-PH-20091-SR-01V4).

Single mutations that reduced neutralization potency (IC50) of either REGN10933 or REGN10987 
individually (e.g., 51-fold decrease with E406D for REGN10933 and 463-fold decrease with N439K for 
REGN10987) did not reduce neutralization potency of REGN-COV2. Notably, REGN-COV2 combination did 
not demonstrate reduction in neutralization potency >6-fold with any of the variants tested.  
Further neutralization studies were performed using authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates of the various variants 
of interest/concern (Table 5), with IC50s and IC90s calculated for the gamma and delta variants (Table 
5, lower panel).

Development of viral escape mutants (in vitro) 
The Applicant performed in vitro viral escape mutant studies to evaluate the selection of SARS-CoV-2 S 
protein escape mutant due to presence of a range of concentrations of anti-S protein mAbs (REGN10933, 
REGN10987 and REGN-COV2). Treatment of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S virus with REGN10933 and REGN10987 
resulted in rapid virus escape, defined as ≥20% CPE, within 2 passages; whereas for REGN-COV2, 
mutations that impacted sensitivity to both antibodies were not identified in the population until passage 
6. Putative escape mutations were identified through sequencing analysis. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 36/147
 
In subsequent in vitro neutralisation studies using pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles pseudotyped with 
RBD-encoding putative escape mutations from passaged virus, mutations that impacted REGN10933 or 
REGN10987 potency were neutralized by combination. REGN-COV2 demonstrated potency against all 
tested escape mutants and wild-type pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles in the picomolar range, with 
IC50 values differing no more than 10-fold based on assay variability. A double mutant (K417R/K444Q) 
was required to see reduction in neutralisation potency by combination REGN-COV2, which impacted the 
IC50 by 89-fold.  
In vivo PoC studies (R10933-PH-20093, R10933-PH-20160, R10933-PH-20161-PD-01V1, R10933-PH-
20192) 
In vitro binding and cell-based functional studies were complemented by in vivo studies conducted in NHP 
rhesus macaque monkeys and Syrian Golden hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the rhesus macaque 
results in mild disease with none or limited clinical signs, multifocal lung lesions with mild to moderate, 
interstitial pneumonia. The virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract and virus quantitation 
at these sites therefore serves as the primary study endpoint for evaluating efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine 
/treatment candidates in this species. The Syrian Golden Hamster model manifests a more severe disease 
phenotype than rhesus macaques, characterized by rapid weight loss and severe lung pathology. Both 
animal models are considered established SARS-CoV-2 infection models. In an in vivo non-GLP study the 
Applicant evaluated REGN-COV2 for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus 
macaque model, using a mucosal route of exposure (R10933-PH-20093). The study evaluated intravenous 
dose administration three days prior to exposure (prophylactic arm) and 1 day after exposure (therapeutic 
arm) at different dose levels. There were no unscheduled deaths during the course of this study. 
Histopathological findings in the lungs, when present, were consistent with reported lesions for SARS-
CoV-2 in rhesus macaques. Oral and nasal swab samples were collected throughout the study and 
analysed via qRT-PCR to quantify viral load. Results from qRT-PCR suggest that high dose prophylactic 
treatment (50mg/kg) and therapeutic treatments (25mg/kg and 150mg/kg) effectively decreased viral 
burden. Viral loads declined more rapidly in treated animals than placebo control animals. Viral replication 
and viral shedding appeared to decrease more quickly in treated animals. Furthermore, RNAseq analysis 
was performed to assess for putative viral escape mutants in SARS-CoV-2 S protein in rhesus monkeys 
following prophylactic or therapeutic administration of REGN-COV2. All variants identified in the REGN-
COV2 treated animals were also present in the placebo group, with approximately half of these variants 
already being present in the inoculum.  
A subsequent in vivo study was conducted to further evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of REGN-COV2 for 
prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques (10933-PH-20160). Briefly, Rhesus monkeys 
were given a single IV injection of 50 mg/kg REGN-COV2 (25 mg/kg/antibody) or placebo 3 days prior to 
challenge with a total inoculum of 1.1E05 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 via combined IT/IN inoculation (Day 0). 
Results for both nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid show that monkeys given 
REGN-COV2 prophylactically demonstrate a reduction of gRNA and nearly complete ablation of viral sgRNA 
(reflecting newly replicating virus) when compared with animals receiving placebo. In summary, a single 
50 mg/kg IV dose of REGN-COV2 administered prophylactically 3 days prior to challenge with SARS-CoV-
2 reduces viral load in the upper and lower airways. These results confirmed the prophylactic treatment 
effect of REGN-COV2 indicated in the previous nonclinical study performed in rhesus macaque (R10933-
PH-20093). 
In addition, based on the pathology summary report provided, REGN-COV2 prophylactic treatment slightly 
reduced the severity of SARS-CoV-2 induced lung inflammation as well the incidence of number of lung 
lobes affected, suggesting possible efficacy in this rhesus macaque model of COVID-19. Furthermore, the 
Applicant studied the therapeutic and prophylactic effect of REGN-COV2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection using 
Syrian Golden Hamster as a model (R10933-PH-20161-PD-01V1) which is characterized by rapid weight

loss and severe lung pathology. Briefly, fifty 6-8-week-old male and female hamsters were randomized 
to dosing groups and given a single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of REGN-COV2 (0.5, 5, or 50 mg/kg), 
IgG1 isotype control (50 mg/kg), or placebo 2 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge (prophylactic) or 1 
day post-SARS-CoV-2 challenge (therapeutic). In both study arms, hamsters were intranasally challenged 
on Day 0 with 2.3x104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Study endpoints included body weights, clinical signs, and 
viral loads in the upper (oral swabs) and lower (lungs) respiratory tract of the animals and results are 
summarized in Figure 5.

Furthermore, the potential for a sub-neutralizing dose (0.0005 mg/kg) of REGN-COV2 to mediate ADE of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed in Syrian golden hamsters (R10933-PH-20192-SR). Hamsters (n=5 
to 7) were given a single IP injection of REGN-COV2 (0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg/kg [0.00025, 
0.0025,

PFU SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). 
Body weight was assessed daily as an indicator of morbidity, with the percentage change in body weight 
from baseline (day of challenge) graphed. Lung tissue was harvested at the end of the study to assess 
viral load (log10 copies/g), measured by qRT-PCR, and pathology, assessed using a 5-point scale of

inflammation severity. Details are outlined in R10933-PH-20192-SR. As seen in the previous hamster 
study, prophylactic administration of REGN-COV2 protected against weight loss and reduced the severity 
of lung inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The high dose (5 mg/kg) also reduced the incidences 
of lung inflammation and secondary changes such as type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (R10933-PH-20192-
SR Appendix). Viral load in lungs was also reduced at 5 mg/kg REGN-COV2 relative to placebo. 
Importantly, ADE of infection was not observed at a sub-neutralizing dose of REGN-COV2, as indicated 
by a lack of more severe weight loss, increased inflammation, or enhanced viral load relative to placebo. 
Likewise, no clear differences in efficacy between the IgG1 and IgG4P-GG isotype versions of REGN10933 
and REGN10987 were determined, further supporting lack of FCGR-mediated ADE. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infectivity can lead to enhanced viral replication, 
increased inflammation, or more severe disease as a result of the antibody Fc domain simultaneously 
binding virus particles and cell-surface Fc gamma receptors. 
The potential of REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2 to mediate ADE of virus infection was also 
investigated in vitro. Briefly, Fcgamma receptor positive (FCGR+) U937, THP1, IM9, K562, and Raji cells 
were co-incubated with pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles and a range of concentrations of  
REGN10933, REGN10987 and REGN-COV2, and assessed by flow cytometry to determine the 
percentage of cells containing pseudoparticles. Ramos cells, which were determined to be FCGR-
negative, served as a negative control. Results are summarized in Table 6.

Maximum percentage of viral entry is defined as the highest mean percentage of mNeon+ cells within live/singlets 
across the tested antibody dose range (3.05pM to 200nM). 
 
To assess the likelihood of ADE in a more physiologically relevant in vitro system, a study using SARS-
CoV-2 virus and FCGR-positive primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from 2 human donors 
was conducted (R10933-PH-21015). Neither REGN10933, REGN10987, nor REGN-COV2 demonstrated 
any evidence of mediating ADE, as evidenced by very low (<1.4%) viral antigen-positive MDMs, 
independent of whether the cells were untreated or incubated with anti-S protein mAbs or isotype control. 
Furthermore, the percentage of viral antigen-positive cells did not correlate with the concentration of anti-
S protein mAbs. Therefore, in contrast to studies with pseudoparticles and immortalized cell lines, studies 
with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and primary human monocytic cells did not show enhancement of viral uptake 
in the presence of the anti-S protein mAbs.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology endpoints (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory or neurobiological endpoints) were 
evaluated as part of the repeat-dose toxicity study conducted in Cynomolgus Monkeys (R10933-TX-
20064). There was no mortality or adverse clinical signs evident throughout the dosing period, and there 
were no drug-related changes in any of the parameters evaluated. There were no macroscopic or 
microscopic findings or organ-weight changes related to the administration of REGN10933 and/or 
REGN10987.  
 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies of pharmacodynamic drug interactions have been submitted. Considering the nature of the 
product this is acceptable. 
 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support clinical development, the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
toxicokinetics (as part of the GLP- repeat dose tox study) of REGN10933 and REGN10987 given alone and 
in combination as REGN-COV2 were characterized following individual or combined administration to 
cynomolgus monkeys. It is noted that IV and SC administration was evaluated for PK.  
Females were not included in the PK studies, but TK data from both males and females do not indicate 
sex differences. 
Methods of Analysis 
Drug concentrations in serum were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
for human IgG. The results for method validation demonstrate that the assay accurately measures levels 
of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, separately or in combination. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analysis (NCA). 
 
PK studies (R10933-PK-20071 (pilot), R10933-PK-20074) 
The PK of total REGN10933 and total REGN10987 when administered individually or in combination as 
REGN-COV2 is described as linear, as would be expected for mAbs directed against an exogenous target. 
Following a single IV or SC administration of REGN10933 and REGN10987 administered individually or in 
combination to cynomolgus monkeys, concentration-time profiles were characterized by an initial brief 
distribution phase (IV) or an absorption phase (SC), followed by a single linear elimination phase. 
Following SC administration of 10 mg/kg/antibody (total dose of 20 mg/kg REGN-COV2), mean time to 
peak concentration (tmax) in serum was observed approximately 4 days postdose, and the estimated 
bioavailability was 81.6%. Pharmacokinetic results are summarised in Table 7.

No studies on tissue distribution, metabolism and excretion have been conducted for REGN10933, 
REGN10987, or REGN-COV2. Considering the nature of the product this is accepted and in accordance 
with ICH S6(R1). 
 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A short-term safety study was conducted in a single species, consistent with ICH S6(R1) as REGN10933 
and REGN10987 are directed against an exogenous target. The cynomolgus monkey was chosen as the 
test species to allow for a robust evaluation of cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology 
endpoints and to facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment for estimating drug exposures in humans.   
In addition, ex vivo GLP-tissue cross-reactivity studies were conducted using panels of normal human and 
cynomolgus monkey tissues and selected human fetal tissues. 
Single dose toxicity 
Not applicable.

Repeat dose toxicity 
In a 4-week GLP study in male and female Cynomolgus monkeys aged 2.2-4 years (study R10933-TX-
20064), weekly IV injections of 50 mg/kg REGN10933 alone or REGN10987 alone, or weekly IV or SC 
injections of up to 150 mg/kg/antibody REGN-COV2 were well tolerated. Incidences of increased ALT, lens 
opacity and injection site abrasions were considered unlikely related to treatment, due to slight severity, 
single incidences, and (except for skin abrasion) similar findings in non-treated animals. 
Cytokine levels measured for 5 days following first dose were either below LLOQ (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and 
IFN-γ), or not considered treatment-related (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-8) due to low magnitude (within 
predose or control ranges) and sporadic findings. In addition, sporadic increases in plasma MCP-1 
concentrations above control levels were observed in 4 animals on Day 1, considered of uncertain relation 
to REGN10933 and/or REGN10987 administration.  
Based on the lack of adverse effects, the NOAEL is considered to be 50 mg/kg REGN10933 and 50 mg/kg 
REGN10987 when administered alone and 150 mg/kg/antibody (total dose of 300 mg/kg) for REGN-COV2, 
the highest doses evaluated. 
Based on exposure levels at NOAEL and predicted human exposure based on population PK models for  
REGN10933 and REGN10987, generated by interim data from clinical studies COV-2067, COV-20145 and 
COV-2069, the estimated margins were ≥38 at single therapeutic or prophylactic doses and ≥ and ≥17 
at repeated prophylactic doses  
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted for REGN-COV2. This is acceptable for an exogenous target and 
in line with ICH S6(R1). 
 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted for REGN-COV2. This is acceptable for an exogenous target 
and in line with ICH S6(R1). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
During the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (2.2 to 4.0 years 
old) (R10933-TX-20064), there were no drug-related macroscopic or microscopic changes in the testes, 
epididymides, ovaries, uterus, or vagina. The study did not identify any potential risks to fertility. Because 
REGN10933 and REGN10987 are directed against an exogenous target (SARS-CoV-2), dedicated 
reproductive and developmental toxicology studies or studies in juvenile animals were not conducted, 
consistent with the ICH S6(R1). This is also supported by the lack of cross reactivity with reproductive or 
foetal tissues in the tissue cross reactivity studies (see further below).  
Toxicokinetic data 
In the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study, continuous exposure to total REGN10933, total 
REGN10987, or total REGN-COV2 was maintained in all drug-treated animals throughout the treatment 
period with detectable concentrations observed in all drug-treated animals through the end of the recovery 
period. Dose-proportional increases in exposure were observed across the individual mAb and combination 
dose groups during the treatment and the recovery periods, indicating that linearity in PK was maintained 
throughout the study and there was no impact on the TK of the individual REGN10933 or REGN10987 
mAbs when given in combination. Results are summarised in Table 8.

and total REGN-COV2 in the Cynomolgus monkey (Study R10933-TX-20064) 
 
 
No apparent impact of ADA on total REGN10933 and total REGN10987 concentration-time profiles was 
observed in the definitive PK study or in the toxicology study. However, in the pilot PK study, 1 animal 
that received 1 mg/kg REGN10987 via IV injection exhibited a precipitous decline in serum concentrations 
of REGN10987 after dosing. Concentrations considered to be impacted by ADA were excluded from mean 
concentration calculations and NCA. 
 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerability of the IV administration of REGN10933 and REGN10987 alone or the IV or SC 
administration of REGN-COV2 was evaluated in the GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys (R10933-TX-20064). There were no drug-related macroscopic or microscopic 
findings at the IV or SC administration sites. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Serum samples were not analysed for potential ADA formation/ This  was assessed by visual inspection 
of individual concentration-time profiles in the single-dose pilot PK study (R10933-PK-20074), the single-
dose definitive PK study (R10933-PK-20071), and the 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study (R10933-TX-
20064). The overall impact of ADA was low and generally dose independent. The observed potential ADA 
responses in monkeys are not necessarily predictive of immunogenicity in humans and did not affect the 
ability to characterize the PK or safety profiles of REGN10933, REGN10987, or REGN-COV2 in the monkey 
studies. It is however not clear whether the method used to quantitate REGN-COV2 in monkey serum 
actually will report a reduction in REGN-COV2 exposure as a result of neutralizing ADAs.  
Immunotoxicity 
No drug-related hematologic changes or changes in plasma cytokine concentrations observed during the 
GLP 4-week repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, no drug-related 
macroscopic or microscopic findings were noted in the bone marrow, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, or 
liver. GLP-Tissue Cross reactivity studies (R10933-TX-20129, R10933-TX-20065)

In the ex vivo tissue cross-reactivity studies, there was no off-target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 
in any of the human or monkey tissues or human fetal tissues evaluated, which was anticipated as both 
mAbs bind an exogenous protein. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) was submitted including an acceptable justification for not 
providing ERA studies. Considering the nature of Ronapreve, which consists of large proteins, these are 
not expected to be stable or remain biologically active in the environment and unlikely to pose a risk to 
the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The applicant applied a comprehensive set of in vitro studies to analyse binding sites, structural analysis 
of the REGN-COV2-target-complex, binding affinities and concentration-dependent blocking of SARS-CoV-
2 RBD to human ACE2. Results demonstrated that REGN10933 and REGN10987 (casirivimab and 
imdevimab) bind specifically to non-overlapping epitopes of the RBD of the spike glycoprotein of 
SARS-CoV-2, thereby neutralizing virus infectivity by blocking binding to human angiotensin converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2). As no RBD residues are shared by REGN10933 and REGN10987, a single point mutation 
is unlikely to affect both epitopes, supporting the rationale for co-development (REGN-COV2) of the two 
mAbs. The results support the development of the combinational treatment using REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 (REGN-COV2), aiming to decrease the potential for loss of efficacy caused by (naturally) 
evolving variants during Covid-19 pandemic. 
Sequence analysis revealed that the epitopes bound by REGN-COV2 are conserved in (as of March 2021) 
circulating variants. 
Functional in vitro characterisation demonstrated that ADCP and ADCC, but not CDC activity are part of 
the mode of action of REGN-COV2. In addition, REGN-COV2 and the individual mAbs were shown to 
neutralise SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity in a dose dependent-manner in vitro. It is understood that these 
effector functions are anticipated and contribute to the mode of action. Based on current literature, the 
role of antibody effector function in protection against SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, however, it has been well 
established that it plays an important role in mAb therapeutic efficacy against other viruses. In addition, 
effector cells including macrophages and monocytes have also been shown to be important for antibody-
mediated protection from SARS-CoV-1 infection (Yasui et al., 2014).  
Overall, the anticipated biological activity for REGN-COV2 is considered demonstrated.  
Moreover, the development of viral escape mutants affecting the potency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs 
appear to be minimised due to the combinational treatment (REGN-COV2) as demonstrated by in vitro 
and in vivo macaque data.  
Notably, REGN-COV2 retained neutralisation activity in vitro against different RBD (aa R319-F541) 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in circulation as of October 2021. 
The variants/mutants were identified in vitro under antibody pressure with anti-S protein mAbs (R10933-
PH-20100), as well as S protein variants identified from preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and 
publicly available sources of SARS-CoV-2 virus in circulation. WT SARS-CoV-2 or the S protein variant, 
D614G, the predominant globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus (Yurkovetskiy, 2020), was used as the 
reference virus to calculate fold changes for each variant tested in these assays. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 44/147
 
Importantly, REGN-COV2 retained neutralization potency against the full sequences or key residues of 
the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.617.1/2 (Delta) variants of interest/concern 
as defined by the CDC (CDC, 2021). Likewise, REGN-COV2 neutralized the L452R and E484K mutations, 
which have been identified in multiple variants of interest/concern such as B.1.427/9 (Espilon) and 
B.1.526 (Iota), respectively, and have been flagged by the CDC as substitutions of therapeutic concern 
(CDC, 2021). None of the variants of interest/concern resulted in complete loss of neutralization of 
REGN10933 or showed any impact on REGN10987. 
Further neutralization studies were performed using authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates of the B.1.617.1, 
B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants of interest/concern. In alignment with neutralization data using pseudo-
particles, REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN-COV2 mediated neutralisation of authentic SARS-CoV-2 
isolates from the B.1.617.1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 lineages in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, 
REGN-COV2 retained neutralization potency against all tested authentic isolates of variants of 
interest/concern compared with reference virus (Washington-1 isolate). 
In summary, assessment of the REGN-COV2 combination for neutralization potency against full sequences 
or key residues identified in the S protein of variants of interest/concern (CDC, 2021) (McCormick, 2021) 
has demonstrated that the combination retains potency against all of these variants. The applicant will 
continuously monitor emergent variants and inform the Agency on REGN-COV2 neutralization activity 
against circulating SARS-COV2 RBD variants, once available. 
Monotherapy with individual anti-S protein mAbs, but not combination REGN-COV2, results in the rapid 
selection of viral escape mutants in vitro and a functional impact on neutralisation potency of the individual 
mAbs, whereas the potency of REGN-COV2 was retained within 10-fold. These results further support the 
development of the combinational anti-SARS-CoV-2 S mAbs as the development of escape mutants, 
appear to be minimised due to the combination of REGN10933 and REGN10987. 
In vitro studies conducted to assess the potential risk for ADE of viral infection indicate that REGN10987 
alone or in combination with REGN10933 (REGN-COV2) mediates entry of pVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S 
pseudoparticles into two out of five FCGR+ cell lines.  REGN10933 alone did not mediate entry of pVSV-
SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles into any of the tested cell lines. The clinical translation of these results 
and their relevance is however currently unclear.  
To assess the likelihood of ADE in a more physiologically relevant in vitro system, a study using SARS-
CoV-2 virus and FCGR-positive primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from 2 human donors 
was conducted. Neither REGN10933, REGN10987, nor REGN-COV2 demonstrated any evidence of 
mediating ADE, as evidenced by very low (<1.4%) viral antigen-positive MDMs, independent of whether 
the cells were untreated or incubated with anti-S protein mAbs or isotype control. Lack of ADE is currently 
supported by in vivo studies data from the SARS-CoV-2 infection rhesus macaque and the Syrian Golden 
Hamster model (see in vivo primary pharmacology section). There was no evidence of ADE in vivo using 
the Syrian Golden Hamster model, as prophylactic REGN-COV2 administration at all tested dose levels 
(including low and sub-neutralizing dosing) did not result in enhanced body-weight loss, increased viral 
load, or more severe lung pathology. The applicant concluded that these data indicate a lack of evidence 
for ADE of viral infectivity. Overall, based on the data provided it is agreed that the REGN-COV2 itself 
does not trigger/mediate ADE in the model system used. 
In vivo PoC studies (therapeutic and prophylactic administration) were conducted in NHP rhesus macaque 
monkeys and Syrian Golden Hamsters. The use of two animal models to capture the diverse pathology of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is acknowledged and accepted. 
Therapeutic administration of REGN-COV2 at 25 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg in rhesus macaques infected with 
SARS CoV-2 resulted in accelerated viral clearance in nasopharyngeal swabs and oral swabs, as well as 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 45/147
 
reduced lung pathology, relative to placebo-treated animals. Prophylactic administration (50 mg/kg IV) 3 
days prior to challenge with SARS-CoV2 reduces viral load in the upper and lower airways. 
Therapeutic administration of REGN-COV2 at 5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses in SARS-CoV-2 infected 
hamsters provided a therapeutic benefit as demonstrated by limited weight loss relative to placebo treated 
animals. Additionally, the prophylactic administration of REGN-COV2 at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg resulted in less 
severe lung pathology. 
Overall, based on the comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies currently presented the proof-of-concept 
is considered established and the data provided support the development of the combinational treatment 
of REGN10933 and REGN10987. REGN-COV2 reduces viral load and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in airways 
of animals, and thereby reduce infection mediated lung pathology in these models.  
Pharmacokinetics 
To support clinical development, the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
toxicokinetics (TK) of REGN10933 and REGN10987 given alone and in combination as REGN-COV2 were 
characterized following individual or combined administration to cynomolgus monkeys.  
Serum samples were not analysed for potential ADAs. No apparent reductions in exposure were seen on 
individual concentration-time profiles from the definitive PK study or the toxicity study.  
Overall, the nonclinical PK data obtained for REGN-COV2 were as predicted for mAbs directed against an 
exogenous target, with linear kinetics demonstrated for both REGN10933 and REGN10987 when 
administered alone as well as in combination across all studies, and no impact on the PK and TK of the 
individual  REGN10933 and REGN10987 mAbs was observed when given in combination. 
Toxicology 
A short-term safety study was conducted in a single species (cynomolgus monkey) as REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 are directed against an exogenous target. This is consistent with ICH S6(R1) and CHMP 
Scientific Advice.  
Once weekly administrations of REGN10933 alone, REGN10987 alone, and REGN-COV2, were well 
tolerated at all dose levels, with no drug-related or adverse effects evident. In addition, there were no 
drug-related macroscopic or microscopic findings at the IV or SC administration sites. Based on the lack 
of adverse effects, the NOAEL is considered to be 50 mg/kg REGN10933 and 50 mg/kg REGN10987 when 
administered alone and 150 mg/kg/antibody (total dose of 300 mg/kg) for REGN-COV2, the highest doses 
evaluated. The absence of adverse findings in the repeat-dose toxicity study was anticipated, given that 
REGN-COV2 binds to an exogenous viral target. 
Based on exposure levels at NOAEL and the human exposure levels calculated from population PK models 
for REGN10933 and REGN10987, generated by interim data from clinical studies COV-2067, COV-20145 
and COV-2069. the provided data support substantial exposure margins between NOAEL in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in monkeys and intended clinical use of REGN-COV2.  
Based on the exogenous binding targets of the product, and the lack of other findings in non-infected 
animals, an immunotoxic potential of REGN-COV2 is not expected 
In the ex vivo tissue cross-reactivity studies, there was no off-target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 
in any of the human or monkey tissues or human fetal tissues evaluated, which was anticipated as both 
mAbs bind an exogenous protein.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK data have been generated after intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) dosing with Ronapreve, i.e. 
with IV or SC co-administration of casirivimab and imdevimab. The total doses of Ronapreve stated in 
this report reflect co-administration of equal amounts of the two components (e.g. 1200 mg Ronapreve 
equates with co-administration of 600 mg of each component). 
All submitted clinical studies collected some PK data as summarised below. 
COV-2069 Cohort A provided PK data after a single SC dose of 1200 mg in generally healthy adults 
not infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
COV-2069 Cohort B provided PK data after a single SC dose of 1200 mg in generally healthy and 
asymptomatic adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
HV-2093 enrolled generally healthy volunteers adults not infected with SARS-CoV-2, with or without 
underlying stable conditions. This study involved SC dosing every 4 weeks for 6 months with 1200 mg. 
COV-2067 provided PK data from infected and non-hospitalised symptomatic subjects who received 
single IV doses of Ronapreve (1200 mg, 2400 mg or 8000 mg) for treatment of COVID-19. 
COV-2066 provided PK data from hospitalised subjects who received single IV doses of Ronapreve 
(2400 mg or 8000 mg) for treatment of COVID-19. 
COV-20145 compared IV and SC dosing in parallel groups of infected adults, with or without COVID-19 
symptoms. 
Data have been analysed by non-compartmental and population PK analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic data from studies COV-2067, COV-20145, and COV-2069 (A and B) were included in 
the population PK dataset for the estimation of pop PK models for casirivimab and imdevimab. As the 
observed data indicated comparable PK of both mAbs, the final population PK models for casirivimab

and imdevimab have the same 2-compartmental structure with identical statistically significant 
covariates and similar PK parameter estimates. The parameters for casirivimab are listed in Table 9.

casirivimab 
 
Visual predictive check plots 
The predictive performance of the final models for casirivimab and imdevimab was evaluated through an 
internal visual predictive check (VPC). From 500 simulated datasets conditioned upon the observed 
study designs, 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the median, and the 5th and 95th 
percentiles of Mab concentration-time profiles. The simulated 90% CIs of the median, and VPC plots 
imdevimab stratified by route of administration are presented in Figure 6.

Absorption  
Casirivimab+imdevimab administered as a single dose of 1200 mg (600 mg each mAb) IV as a 1-hour 
infusion results in peak concentrations at the end of the infusion (100% bioavailability). 
Following casirivimab+imdevimab administered as a single dose of 1200 mg SC (600 mg each mAb), 
casirivimab and imdevimab were absorbed with a population PK estimated bioavailability of 71.8% for 
casirivimab and 71.7% for imdevimab. Estimated tmax was 6.7 days (5th and 95th percentile: 4.4, 9.3) 
for casirivimab and 6.6 days (5th and 95th percentile: 4.4, 9.1) for imdevimab.  
Mean Cmax (SD) reached after 600 mg SC single dose of casirivimab was 52.2 (12.15) mg/L, mean 
Cmax (SD) reached after 600 mg SC single dose of imdevimab was calculated to 49.2 (11.01) mg/L. 
Absorption rate constants ka have been estimated by pop PK analyses to 0.220 (1/day) for casirivimab 
and to 0.197 (1/day) for imdevimab. 
Population PK predicted exposure metrics (i.e., Cmax, AUC0-28, and AUC0-inf) for casirivimab and 
imdevimab were comparable after either a single 1200 mg (600 mg per mAb) IV dose, or a single 1200 
mg (600 mg per mAb) SC dose (Table 10). 
Table 10. Population PK exposure predictions for casirivimab and imdevimab following single dose of 
1200 mg (600 mg per mAb) SC or IV 
 
 
As expected, serum levels of casirivimab and imdevimab in the initial days after dosing are higher with 
IV vs. SC dosing. SC administration gives a much lower Cmax and longer Tmax (about 6.5 days) for 
casirivimab and imdevimab. Lower AUCs for each of casirivimab and imdevimab when the same dose is 
given SC vs. IV but by Day 28 the serum levels (C28) are similar for the two dosing routes. 
Data from COV-20145 show the effect of the longer Tmax and reduced bioavailability on serum 
concentrations after a 1200 mg SC dose vs. a 1200 mg IV dose. On day 2, the mean serum casirivimab 
and imdevimab concentrations were ~115 mg/L for both components after 1200 mg IV compared to 
~42 mg/L for each after 1200 mg SC. Similarly, the day 6 serum concentrations were in the range 80-
90 mg/L after 1200 mg IV vs. ~55 mg/L after 1200 mg SC.

Distribution 
As is typical for a mAb, the distribution of casirivimab and imdevimab is primarily restricted to the 
vascular compartment. Based on population PK analysis, the central volume of distribution (Vc) and the 
peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) for casirivimab are estimated to 3.9 L and 3.3 L and for 
imdevimab to 3.9 L and 3.6 L, respectively. The total volume of distribution (calculated as the sum of Vc 
+ Vp) of casirivimab is 7.161 L while that of imdevimab is 7.425 L.   
 
Elimination 
Consistent with other antibodies, the metabolism of casirivimab and imdevimab is expected to be 
limited to proteolytic catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids by the endoplasmic 
reticulum system.  
Based on population PK analysis, mean clearance (SD) and mean terminal elimination half-life of 
casirivimab (0.188 (0.054) L/day; 29.8 (8.14) days) and imdevimab (0.277 (0.0636) L/day; 26.2 
(5.67) days) were comparable. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose ranging PK data following single IV (300 mg to 8000 mg) and SC (600 mg and 1200 mg) doses of 
casirivimab and imdevimab indicate overall a dose-proportional increase in exposure across the dose 
range studied (study COV-2067 and COV-20145). No dose-ranging PK data following multiple dosing 
are available to characterize dose-proportionality in steady state. 
The observed concentration-time profiles of casirivimab and imdevimab in uninfected adult subjects 
(study HV-2093) and outpatients with COVID-19 (studies COV-2067, COV-20145) exhibited 
concentration-time profiles with a terminal elimination phase described by mono-exponential decline. 
Multiple doses of 1200 mg SC were investigated in Study HV-2093 in healthy subjects. In non-infected 
adult subjects, based on the observed concentration versus time profiles, steady state was achieved 
following the third casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC Q4W dose (week 12) and was maintained 
throughout the remainder of the 24-week treatment period. After six 1200 mg SC Q4W doses, observed 
Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss were 105 (37.9) mg/mL and 72.4 (31.3) mg/mL for casirivimab, and 83.0 
(31.7) mg/mL and 50.5 (23.2) mg/mL for imdevimab, respectively. This results in serum accumulated 
approximately 2.2-fold and 2-fold based on Ctrough over the duration of treatment compared to the 
Ctrough after the first dose. 
Special populations 
None of the statistically significant covariates identified by the population PK models (body weight, 
albumin, viral load (log10 copies/mL), Black (race), mild hepatic impairment, or gender) indicate a 
meaningful impact on exposures of casirivimab and imdevimab. No dose adjustment based on these 
covariates is deemed warranted.  
 
Elderly 
The population PK analysis included data from subjects from 18 to 96 years and advancing age was not 
identified as a significant covariate on PK for casirivimab or imdevimab. Exposures to casirivimab and

imdevimab were similar in subjects aged <65, 65-74 and ≥ 75 years after IV or SC administration (data 
not shown).  
The number of subjects above 65 years for each clinical trial are summarised in Table 11. 
Table 11. Patients/Subjects by Study and Age Group (PK Analysis Set) 
 
Paediatric population 
For study COV-2067, concentration results for casirivimab and imdevimab for the paediatric dose 
equivalent to the adult 1200 mg IV dose are available for a total of 24 paediatric patients (N=19 at 
weight ≥ 40 kg), and in 26 paediatric subjects (N=22 at weight ≥ 40 kg) for the paediatric dose 
equivalent to the adult 2400 mg IV dose. For study COV-2069, casirivimab and imdevimab 
concentration results for the paediatric dose equivalent to the adult 1200 mg SC dose are available for a 
total of 65 paediatric subjects (N=64 at weight ≥ 40 kg).  
The observed casirivimab and imdevimab Ceoi and C28 values for paediatric subjects in the ≥40 kg 
body weight tiers (COV-2067) were similar to those values observed in adult outpatients following the 
1200 and 2400 mg IV doses, Concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum in adolescents 
following SC administration in the ≥40 kg body weight tiers at both 28 and 112 days after dosing were 
similar to observed values in adults following a single 1200 mg SC dose (COV-2069).  
Observed concentrations were consistent with population PK predicted values as shown by external 
validation.  
The expected exposure for casirivimab and imdevimab in adolescents is listed in Tables 12, 13 and 14.

Target population 
In the target population, at the recommended clinical dose of 1200 mg SC (600 mg per mAb) IV and 
SC, concentration-time profiles for casirivimab and imdevimab were comparable between studies COV-
2067 and COV-20145 (IV), across studies COV-2069A, COV-2069B, and COV-20145 (SC) and 
consistent with the population PK model simulated concentrations, respectively, including external 
validation of PK data from healthy subjects (Study HV-2093). 
No differences in concentration-time profiles for casirivimab and imdevimab were observed in SARS-
CoV-2 infected and uninfected subjects. PK results indicate that COVID-19 disease severity, baseline 
viral load and serostatus did not affect the PK of either casirivimab or imdevimab for the IV and SC dose 
groups. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal PK interaction studies have been performed with casirivimab and imdevimab. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of casirivimab+imdevimab was evaluated in multiple studies comprised of 
different participant populations across the COVID-19 disease spectrum, including study COV-2067 
phase 1/2 and phase 3, study COV-20145 and study COV-2069 cohort B.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021

The PD effect of casirivimab+imdevimab was assessed by measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction 
(as measured by RT-qPCR), which is a direct effect of the mechanism of action to block viral entry and 
prevent infection of host cells. 
Mechanism of action 
Casirivimab+imdevimab (REGN10933+REGN10987) is a cocktail of two human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against different, non-overlapping epitopes in the spike 
(S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). The antibodies are developed for the treatment or prevention (acute and chronic) of SARS-CoV-
2 infection in adults and paediatric individuals (≥40 kg). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
A population PK/PD model for viral dynamics was developed to describe the relationship between the PD 
response of SARS-CoV-2 viral load measured in NP swabs collected in patients from the 3 studies, COV-
2067, COV-20145, COV-2069B, and casirivimab and imdevimab. Based upon the assumption that a 
reduction in viral load is related to improved clinical outcomes, the overall goal of these population 
exposure-response analyses was to identify the casirivimab+imdevimab doses that are expected to 
provide near-maximal antiviral activity. The model was used to simulate the viral load-time profile, 
predict the total viral load versus infectious viral load time profile, and predict the viral load-time profile 
for different treatment start dates relative to onset of symptoms.  The predicted individual exposure 
metrics for casirivimab and imdevimab from the final population PK models were used as inputs for this 
population PK/PD modelling.  
Descriptive dose-response analyses investigating the relationship between viral load (PD biomarker) 
reduction and exposure metrics were conducted for clinical studies COV-2067 and COV-20145 in SARS-
CoV-2-infected individuals. 
A summary and visualisation of the data is provided in Figures 7 and 8.

The change from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load or time-weighted average change from baseline in 
SARS-CoV-2 viral load exhibited flat concentration-response relationship over the dose range studied, 
for either IV or SC dosing, in the overall and seronegative populations (Table 15). 
 
 
Table 15. Time-weighted average daily change from baseline in viral load in NP samples from day 1 to 
day 7 (Study COV-20145, Seronegative mFAS) 
 
 
As both therapeutic mAbs are targeting an external target, no secondary PD effects are expected. 
 
Model-based results  
The presence of a high-risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness was associated with a 4.81% decrease in 
the elimination rate of productively infected cells while seropositive/other status at baseline was 
associated with a 110% increase in elimination rate of productively infected cells. 
Exploratory PK/PD analyses across studies and doses (COV-2067, COV-20145, COV-2069) indicate no 
dose- and exposure response relationship with respect to dose- or exposure-related effects on viral load 
data (change from baseline at day 7). This is in line with results from population PK/PD analysis of viral 
dynamics also suggesting that all studied doses result in maximum effect on the PD marker. All doses 
regardless of route of administration and dose strength increased the decline in viral load compared to 
placebo to the same extent.

Although ADA titers have not yet been determined in the titer assay, the low intensity signals observed 
in the ADA screening assay suggested that titers in ADA positive samples were low. Comparison of drug 
concentrations between ADA positive and negative patients showed no difference between these 2 
groups.

The presence of ADA did not affect concentration-time profiles of casirivimab or imdevimab, as the 
concentrations of casirivimab or imdevimab in subjects positive for ADA at any time were within the 
range of concentrations in subjects who were ADA negative at all times or ADA positive only at baseline.  
Study HV-2093: 
One (0.1%) and 14 (2.0%) subjects who received casirivimab+imdevimab experienced treatment-
emergent ADA to casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively; the subject who had treatment-emergent 
ADA to casirivimab also had treatment-emergent ADA to imdevimab.  
The incidence of treatment emergent immunoreactivity in subjects receiving placebo was 0% in the 
anti-casirivimab assay and 2.6% in the anti-imdevimab assay. The ADA titer was low (<1000) for all 
subjects with pre-existing or treatment-emergent immunoreactivity. The concentrations of casirivimab 
and imdevimab in subjects positive for ADA were within the range of concentrations for subjects without 
immunogenicity. 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
In COV-20145, casirivimab and imdevimab exhibited linear and dose-proportional PK after single IV 
doses from 300 mg (i.e. 150 mg casirivimab and 150 mg imdevimab) to 8,000 mg (4,000 mg of each).  
 
As expected, SC administration gives a much lower Cmax and longer Tmax (about 6.5 days) for 
casirivimab and imdevimab. After a 1200 mg SC dose, the POPPK analysis estimated the bioavailability 
of casirivimab and imdevimab to be 71.8% and 71.7%, respectively. In turn, this leads to lower AUCs 
for each of casirivimab and imdevimab when the same dose is given SC vs. IV but by Day 28 the serum 
levels (C28) are similar for the two dosing routes.  
 
Data from COV-20145 show the effect of the longer Tmax and reduced bioavailability on serum 
concentrations after a 1200 mg SC dose vs. a 1200 mg IV dose. On day 2, the mean serum casirivimab 
and imdevimab concentrations were ~115 mg/L for both components after 1200 mg IV compared to 
~42 mg/L for each after 1200 mg SC. Similarly, the day 6 serum concentrations were in the range 80-
90 mg/L after 1200 mg IV vs. ~55 mg/L after 1200 mg SC. 
 
Once casirivimab and imdevimab reach the blood, their distribution and elimination are the same 
regardless of the route of administration. The total volume of distribution estimated via POPPK analysis 
is ~7.2 L and ~7.4 L for casirivimab and imdevimab, respectively. As human monoclonal IgG1 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 59/147
 
antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. For these reasons, no drug-drug 
interactions are expected. The terminal elimination half-life approximates to 26-30 days for casirivimab 
and imdevimab, reflecting slightly higher clearance for imdevimab. 
 
Inter-individual variability is comparable between both mAbs and in an acceptable range. However, 
between-subject-variability of reference exposure (AUCd28, Cd28 and Cmax) are identical for casirivimab 
(21.8%) and imdevimab (18.1%).  
No dose-ranging PK data following multiple dosing are available to characterize dose-proportionality and 
time-dependency at steady state. This is acceptable as the mAb combination is intended for single dose 
use, except for chronic prevention in certain subgroups. Exposure is reliably predicted based on the 
derived pop PK models. 
 
Special populations 
 
The POPPK analysis included data from subjects from 18 to 96 years and advancing age was not 
identified as a significant covariate on PK for casirivimab or imdevimab. Exposures to casirivimab and 
imdevimab were similar in subjects aged <65, 65-74 and ≥ 75 years after IV or SC administration.  
Furthermore, casirivimab and imdevimab do not undergo significant renal elimination due to their 
molecular weight (> 69 kDa) and are not expected to undergo significant hepatic elimination.  
 
Exposure predictions based on the established pop PK model indicated that despite the lower 
concentrations/exposure metrics of casirivimab and imdevimab in the higher weight groups (100-120 kg 
and 120-140 kg), the concentrations/exposure metrics following a single 1200 mg IV or SC dose, and 
during a dosing interval at steady-state, are expected to maintain maximal antiviral activity. The 5th 
percentile of casirivimab+imdevimab combined concentrations in serum exceed Cs, target for all currently 
circulating VOC/VOIs. Exposures simulations do not indicate a need for adaptation of dose 
recommendations based on weight. There is no objection to inclusion of adolescents from 12 years and 
40 kg in the indication statement and no objection to recommending the adult dose for this age and 
weight range. 
 
Posology 
Although no clinical PK or efficacy data are available for the proposed maintenance prophylaxis regimen 
(600 mg -300 mg each mAb) administered Q4W and no definitive efficacy data were available to support 
a 1200 mg SC monthly dosing regimen since this is an exploratory endpoint in HV-2093, expected mean 
exposure predicted based on population PK models for casirivimab and imdevimab indicated that target 
concentrations (IC90) will be reached even at the end of the 4-week interval. However, exposure achieved 
following 600 mg SC is predicted to be below that reached after 1200 mg Q4W, which was studied in 
COV-20145. There was concern that the 600 mg maintenance dose may be suboptimal especially for less 
susceptible variants. Since the safety of 1200 mg SC Q4W appears acceptable and this is a more secure 
dose from the PK point of view, it was recommended that this is used for Q4W follow-on dosing. Therefore, 
the maintenance dosing using the 600 mg dose IV or SC Q4W was asked to be further justified. In 
addition, these concerns applied to patients at high weight.  
The Applicant summarised the data and provided arguments, which could be followed, to justify the 
planned posology for chronic prevention: A loading dose of 1200 mg SC/IV will be followed by a 600 mg 
SC/IV Q4W maintenance dose. This regimen would lead to maintain therapeutic levels over the entire 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 60/147
 
monthly maintenance-dosing interval comparable with those levels reached by a single dose of 1200 mg 
SC (or IV) by day 28, which is sufficient to maintain efficacy in the acute prevention setting. In support, 
pop PK predicted exposure (at steady state), including that expected in patients at higher weight (120 kg 
-140 kg), has been provided, and was related to the concentration needed to achieve maximum antiviral 
activity against VOC/VOI strains.  Population PK simulations show that the median predicted trough 
concentration at steady state of casirivimab and imdevimab in serum for different combinations of IV 
and/or SC, repeat-dose regimens (including 600mg maintenance dosing) is similar (3% lower to 6% 
higher) to the observed median day 28 concentrations in serum for the single 1200 mg SC dose in study 
COV-2069. 
It is agreed that exposure predictions based on pop PK will reach a comparable Ctrough ss following 600 
mg Q4W SC and IV after the 1200 mg loading dose. The derived pop PK model is deemed fit for the 
purpose of robust exposure predictions. Thus, exposure matching for the prevention stetting (C28) with 
Ctrough ss reached is assumed a valuable basis for extrapolation of efficacy. It is plausible that the 
exposure reached is in the range of 1200 mg SC or IV Single dose for all weight categories. The totality 
of evidence is thus deemed sufficient to recommend the 600 mg dose for the maintenance phase. Further, 
given that no definite exposure- and dose response relationship could be established for the prevention 
settings with respect to efficacy and safety, the Applicant’s proposal for reducing the maintenance dose 
is supported by the available evidence. 
The SC route of administration was not used in the pivotal study for treatment (COV-2067) therefore 
there are no efficacy data to support use of 1200 mg SC as an alternative to the 1200 mg IV dose that 
was studied. In the absence of convincing dose-response and exposure-response data, the extrapolation 
of efficacy from the 1200 mg IV dose to the proposed alternative 1200 mg SC dose in the treatment 
setting based on PK bridging was not considered acceptable. There was concern that 1200 mg SC will not 
provide the necessary concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab required for efficient neutralisation 
in the early phase of the disease that is likely critical for prevention of progression to severe disease.  
The applicant argued that the SC administration in the treatment indication is supported from Study COV-
2069 Cohort B in which 1200 mg SC demonstrates clinical efficacy on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
and COVID-19 through early treatment of infected, but asymptomatic individuals) and from the 
exploratory analyses from HV-2093, showing that repeat dose administration of 1200 mg SC monthly was 
highly effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. 
In addition, both modes of administration provided comparable reduction of viral load including at the 
earliest time points measured in infected patients, even in individuals with high viral load at baseline in 
COV-20145 and who received the lowest IV dose of 300 mg studied; however, how this PD effect 
translates into clinical efficacy remains uncertain. 
Furthermore, pop PK simulations indicate – despite the delay due to absorption – a relative fast increase 
within 5 hours to reach exposure expected to be sufficient for maximal antiviral activity. 
Finally, the applicant emphasised the benefit from a public health perspective through the easier access 
for treatment of outpatients via the SC route of administration. To further support this, preliminary data 
on the primary endpoint in clinical trial COV-2067 in relation to days from onset of symptoms to 
randomisation were presented. This analysis showed that patients treated earlier after symptom onset 
appeared to have a lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death than those treated 
later after symptom onset with a greater reduction observed the earlier treatment was initiated. 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab in the first 48 hours after 
subcutaneous administration of 600 mg of each monoclonal antibody indicate lower serum exposures 
compared to intravenous administration of the same dose. It is unknown whether differences in initial 
systemic exposure result in differences in clinical efficacy. It is therefore recommended that the

subcutaneous route of administration is used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would 
lead to a delay in treatment. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The two monoclonal antibodies do not act synergistically based on in-vitro activity. However, by binding 
to non-overlapping regions in the RBD, the combination product has the potential to be effective against 
SARS-Cov-2 even if the virus being treated has mutational resistance to one of the components. Studies 
with some of the currently known variants indicate that reduced susceptibility to casirivimab occurs 
more often than reduced susceptibility to imdevimab.  
 
Authentic virus neutralization data have been generated for a few variants (see also non-clinical 
section). Ronapreve retained neutralization potency against all tested authentic isolates of variants of 
interest/concern compared with reference virus (Washington-1 isolate), including the predominant in EU 
delta variant. 
An interim analysis of 31,102 clinical samples found no evidence that the clinical use of casirivimab and 
imdevimab has led to the selection of viral variants with alterations in the RBD, in casirivimab and 
imdevimab binding epitopes, or other S protein variation. Findings suggest that the overall mutation 
rate is not substantially different between Ronapreve and placebo groups. Of those mutations found at 
baseline or post-baseline in clinical treatment studies, the minority occurred in the RBD. Also, few 
potentially treatment-emergent variants have been detected thus far. Sequencing and analysis of 
additional samples is ongoing for all clinical studies which were submitted with this application.  The 
timeline for the updated analyses for the remaining studies is dependent on the final database locks for 
those trials it is thus recommended that the applicant submits updated reports as soon as these become 
available.  
The ADA analyses are currently incomplete but indicate that ≤3% of subjects develop ADA to casirivimab 
and ≤5% to imdevimab after a single dose. The effect of developing ADA to either component on their 
serum concentrations was assessed within COV-2067. While the applicant claimed no appreciable effect 
of ADA on PK, the graphs do not provide convincing evidence to support a conclusion on the effect of ADA 
on serum levels. 
The population PK/PD modelling which was conducted (viral dynamical modelling) based on viral load 
data did not provide no additional insights in the mechanism of action but was consistent in showing the 
lack of any dose and exposure response relationship. Thus, viral load data as PD biomarker is not 
considered suitable for quantitative conclusion regarding dose selection.   
 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of casirivimab and imdevimab have been well characterized in healthy volunteers 
and in the target population. Due to the possibility of reduced efficacy with subcutaneous administration 
when used for the treatment of COVID-19, in this setting the subcutaneous route of administration is 
used only if intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment. 
The mechanism of action of Ronapreve is well established and despite the lack of clinical data on 
variants of concern, non-clinical data suggest that it retains activity against these, importantly including 
the delta variant.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study COV-20145 
Study COV-20145 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the 
dose response profile of single IV or single SC doses of casirivimab+imdevimab in outpatients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study was conducted with adults who had either asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infection or had COVID-19 but no risk factors for severe COVID-19. Participants were randomized 
equally to receive a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab or placebo by either SC injection or IV 
infusion 
COV-20145 was designed to provide an understanding of the virologic dose response relationship for a 
range of intravenous and subcutaneous doses, including lower intravenous doses than previously tested 
in the COV-2067 study. An additional aim was to assess the role of SC dosing of 
casirivimab+imdevimab in the treatment of outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This dose ranging 
study helps establish the virologic efficacy of lower IV doses and SC doses that may provide clinical 
efficacy and broaden the ability to provide therapeutic doses of casirivimab+imdevimab.  
The following treatment arms were included in the study: casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg IV, 1200 
mg IV, 1200 mg SC, 600 mg IV, 600 mg SC, 300 mg IV, placebo IV, and placebo SC. Randomization 
occurred within 72 hours of obtaining a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test sample. 
NP swab samples were collected every other day for the first week of the study to measure viral load, 
and once weekly for 2 more weeks to assess potential persistence of viral load. After the first month, 
participants had visits approximately once monthly for 4 additional months for safety follow-up. 
Additionally, participants were asked to notify study personnel as soon as possible about any MAVs.  
The primary objective was to assess the virologic efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab across different IV 
and SC doses compared to placebo. For viral load, AUC for change from baseline at a given time point 
was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule and TWA was then calculated. 
The primary efficacy variable was tested hierarchically at an α=0.05, two-sided. If a test was 
insignificant, then the formal testing procedure stopped at that step. The primary analysis of the 
virologic variable demonstrated statistical significance for each of the 6 comparisons tested. 
Single doses of casirivimab+imdevimab of various doses showed significant and comparable virologic 
reduction at all doses assessed (IV: 2400 mg, 1200 mg, 600 mg and 300 mg; SC: 1200 mg and 600 
mg). Similar virologic efficacy was observed at the same dose level (600 mg or 1200 mg) whether 
administered through IV or SC routes (see Table 24). 
Of note, the 600 mg dose (300 mg casirivimab and 300 mg of imdevimab) is sought for repeated 
prevention once every 4 weeks. Short term PK data are provided, and simulation data are available and 
are discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section of this report. 
Effects on the time course of viral load through day 7 by baseline load groups are shown in Figure 10.

Study Participants  
The study population in all 3 phases comprised non-hospitalised patients who have a positive diagnostic 
test for SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in Phases 1 and 3 were to be symptomatic. Phase 2 subjects could be 
symptomatic or asymptomatic. 
  
Key inclusion criteria for Phase 3 cohorts were: 
o 
a. Cohort 1: ≥18 years of age and not pregnant at randomization

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were subject to modifications, additions, and deletions, across each 
of the study phases as well as within each study phase. 
The most salient change was that with amendment 6 (dated 14 November 2020), subjects enrolled into 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were to have ≥1 risk factor for severe COVID-19, being any of age ≥50 years 
(cohort 1 only); BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (cohort 1 only), BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex based on CDC 
growth charts (cohort 2 ≥2 years only); cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, 
chronic kidney or liver disease, immunocompromised (based on investigator assessment); underlying 
genetic, neurologic, metabolic or congenital heart disease deemed by the investigator to be a risk factor 
for severe COVID-19 (cohort 2 only). The protocol amendment 6 notes that some subjects were 
enrolled into Phase 3 before the requirement for at least one risk factor was implemented.

blinded phase 3 data, the sponsor assumes an event rate of 3.4% for COVID-19-related hospitalization 
or all-cause death among patients on placebo in the mFAS (patients with at least 1 risk factor for severe 
COVID-19 and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RTqPCR test at baseline), and that 83% of all randomized 
patients (FAS) will have a positive SARSCoV- 2 RT-qPCR test at baseline. 
Table 21 presents estimated number of randomized patients with at least 1 risk factor for severe 
COVID-19 at each analysis time point for cohort 1 efficacy analysis.

Randomisation 
Patients in cohort 1 were planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to one of the treatments 
listed below: 
• 
Co-administered casirivimab+imdevimab combination therapy, 1200 mg (600 mg each of 
casirivimab+imdevimab) IV single dose 
• 
Co-administered casirivimab+imdevimab combination therapy, 2400 mg (1200 mg each of 
casirivimab+imdevimab) IV single dose 
• 
Placebo IV single dose 
In phase 3 cohort 1, randomisation was planned to be stratified by country. 
A permuted block randomisation with fixed block length was used for randomization. During the course 
of the study, the initial randomisation list was replaced by a new one in order to introduce the 1200mg 
arm.  
 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The Phase 1/2 portion of the study included all symptomatic subjects up to the 799th individual 
randomised into the study. The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised subjects. The mFAS 
included all randomised with a positive RT-qPCR result from a NP swab obtained at baseline. The 
seronegative FAS and seronegative mFAS were the subsets with documented seronegative status at 
baseline. The mFAS was to be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. Some additional analyses 
were to be conducted in the seronegative mFAS. 
 
For the Phase 2 (asymptomatic) subset, the analysis populations were defined as above. 
 
For Phase 3 (Cohort 1), the primary analysis was planned to be performed based on mFAS, defined as 
all randomized participants in phase 3 (from the 800th randomized patient) with both of the following: 
• 
A qualitatively positive RT-qPCR (via central laboratory) from NP swab samples taken at 
randomization or collected within 2 hours after study drug infusion was initiated 
• 
At least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 at baseline; based on the treatment allocated (as 
randomized). 
Variable and analysis model 
The primary efficacy endpoint for phase 3 cohort 1 was planned to be the proportion of patients with ≥1 
COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through day 29, which was planned to be compared 
between each dose group and placebo using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with 
country as a stratification factor. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 70/147
 
P-values from the stratified CMH test and 95% confidence intervals for the risk ratio and relative risk 
reduction (1-risk ratio) using Farrington-Manning method were planned to be presented. Exact method 
for p-values and confidence intervals were planned to be used if the expected frequencies in all cells are 
not at least 5. 
Prior to amendment 8 a stratified logrank test was planned for the analysis of the primary endpoint, 
which was defined as time to first COVID-19 related medically attended visit (MAV) through day 29 in 
amendment 6, and time to MAV or death through day 29 in amendment 7. 
Significance level and multiplicity 
The final analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was planned at the α level of 0.05. 
The primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints were planned to be tested hierarchically as 
described in Table 22. 
 
Table 22. Statistical testing hierarchy, Phase 3 Cohort 1 analysis, Study COV-2067 
 
 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 71/147
 
Prior to amendment 8 a slightly different hierarchy was planned, in which the previously defined 
primary endpoint of MAVs was also included in the hierarchy. 
 
Interim analyses 
In amendment 8 an interim analysis of the 1200mg vs placebo comparison was introduced. The 2400 
mg group versus placebo comparison for the primary endpoint was conducted after recruitment to the 
placebo arm was closed upon recommendation by the iDMC. If this comparison was positive, an interim 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the 1200 mg group versus placebo comparison was 
planned to be performed at α level of 0.01 based on patients randomized on or before 17 January 2021 
in the mFAS. Final analysis of the proportion of patients with ≥1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-
cause death through day 29 for the 1200 mg group versus placebo comparison (2 in Table 31) was 
planned to be performed based on all patients randomized on or before 24 February 2021. 
Multiplicity control of the interim analysis 
The Gamma family alpha spending function based on the primary endpoint of proportion of patients with 
≥1 COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death through day 29 for the 1200 mg versus placebo 
comparison was planned to be used to control for type I error for the planned interim and final 
analyses. The parameter for the Gamma family spending function was planned to be calculated based 
on the information fraction of the interim analysis, such that the alpha level at the interim analysis is 
equal to 0.01 and the remaining alpha level is calculated based on the gamma parameter. 
The information fraction was planned to be determined based on the sample size in the mFAS at the 
interim analysis and at the final analysis of the primary endpoint for the 1200 mg group versus placebo 
comparison.  
In case of a statistically significant result for this comparison (at interim or final analysis), key endpoints 
for comparisons 3 to 10 were then planned to be performed based on the same subset of patients (i.e. 
patients randomized on or before 17 January 2021 or randomized on or before 24 February 2021) in the 
mFAS in the hierarchical order above at α level of 0.05. 
Non-concurrency of the treatment arms 
The comparison of 1200 mg dose group to placebo was planned to include only the subset of placebo 
patients concurrently randomized with 1200 mg dose group. 
 
Results- Phase 1 and 2 
The results reflect the first 799 subjects enrolled into the study, of which 758 completed and 671 met 
criteria for inclusion in the mFAS (positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at central laboratory). The baseline 
demographic and disease factors, including baseline serostatus, are summarised in Tables 23, 24 and

At baseline, 62.3% had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19/hospitalisation due to COVID-19. 
The most common risk factor was obesity (39.5% with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), followed by age ≥ 50 years 
(30.8%) and cardiovascular disease (21%; mainly hypertension). Less than 2% had chronic renal or 
hepatic disease or were immunosuppressed for any reason. 
 
An initial descriptive virologic efficacy analysis was conducted on the first 275 symptomatic subjects 
randomised into Phases 1 and 2. The prospective virologic (primary) analysis included the subsequent 
524 subjects randomised into Phase 2 (Next Phase 2 population). Clinical efficacy was not assessed 
during the initial descriptive virology analysis. Thus, the prospective clinical analysis included all 799 
randomised into Phase 1 and 2 (Combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 population). 
 
 
Virologic efficacy data  
 
Analyses of virologic endpoints were conducted using mFAS of Next Phase 2 subjects (n=442) based on 
serial NP swabs collected every other day for 14 days and then twice weekly. The RT-qPCR had a LLOQ 
of 2.87 log10 copies/mL.  
 
Treatment with Ronapreve significantly reduced viral load, with statistical significance for the 8 
endpoints tested (Table 26).

participants, Study COV-2067) 
 
 
 
Greater reductions in viral load were observed in those with higher viral load at baseline and in those 
that were seronegative at baseline.  
 
In those with a baseline viral load >7 log10 copies/mL, for each dose there was a -0.68 log10 copies/mL 
difference from placebo in the LSM time-weighted-average daily change from baseline through Day 7. 
In those with a baseline viral load >4 log10 copies/mL, for each dose there was a -0.47 log10 copies/mL 
difference from placebo in the LSM time-weighted-average daily change from baseline through Day 7. 
 
The benefit of Ronapreve was almost exclusively in subjects who had not yet developed effective 
immunity to SARS-COV-2, such that: 
o 
In those seronegative at baseline, there was a -0.74 log10 copies/mL and -0.71 log10 copies/mL 
difference vs. placebo with 2400 mg and 8000 mg, respectively. 
o 
In those seropositive at baseline, the LSM time-weighted-average daily change from baseline in 
viral load through Day 7 was very similar between active and placebo arms. 
 
In subjects with baseline viral load >7 log10 copies/mL, both doses of Ronapreve gave statistically 
significant reductions at each time point up to study day 11, by which time the  
in the active treatment groups was <LLOQ.  
 
Analyses of Medically Attended Visits 
 
Ronapreve significantly reduced the risk for Medically Attended Visits (MAVs) for COVID-19 compared to 
placebo. Using a narrower definition of MAVs, there was a numerical but not statistically significant 
difference (Table 27).

Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted using an adaptive master protocol design, to allow for flexible adaptation and 
seamless enrolment with the intent to maximize identification of early signs of efficacy, allow for the 
potential to study multiple therapeutic combinations, and avoid the use of ineffective dose levels. 
Correspondingly, several significant adaptations were made to the study design over the duration of the 
study (Table 30).

During the phase 3 portion of the study, 579 important protocol deviations occurred in 340 patients 
(7.4%) in the FAS. The most common deviation was receipt of an excluded concomitant medication, 
which occurred in 188 patients, and a procedure not performed, which occurred in 130 patients. Receipt 
of excluded concomitant medication occurred more frequently among patients who received placebo 
compared to active drug. Twenty-three patients who did not satisfy eligibility criteria entered the study. 
Procedures not performed included screening/baseline visit collection of NP swab samples, pregnancy 
test for women of childbearing potential, and haematology, blood chemistry, and/or coagulation tests 
Baseline data 
In general, demographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups (summarised in Tables-
31-34).

688/1034 2400 mg, 700/1027 8000 mg) had ≥1 risk factor for severe COVID-19. 
After protocol amendment 6, all randomized patients (n=2519) were required to have at least 1 risk 
factor for severe disease. As such, across all phase 3, cohort 1 treatment groups, 81.5% (not 68.6%) of 
randomized patients (n=4567/5607) had ≥1 risk factor for severe COVID-19.

Data on the frequency of risk factors for the phase 3 patients in the mFAS were provided. The different 
treatment groups were balanced with respect to the risk factors. The most common risk factors for 
severe COVID-19 at baseline were obesity, defined as BMI ≥30 kg/m2, age ≥50 years, and 
cardiovascular disease including hypertension.  
Chronic lung disease (including asthma) and type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were less common 
(16.4% and 14.9% respectively). Chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, and 
immunocompromised state were uncommon (≤3% frequency).

Ancillary analyses 
 
Subject-reported COVID-19 symptoms were collected daily using the SE-C19 instrument developed by 
Regeneron, in which subjects recorded 23 symptoms daily and by severity. The time from 
randomisation to the first day on which the score was 0 for 19 symptoms (exceptions being cough, 
fatigue and headache, which could have been mild/moderate (score of 1), was statistically significantly 
reduced with Ronapreve vs. placebo, with a similar result for the 1200 mg and 2400 mg doses (Figure 
17) .

COVID-19 (mFAS, Study COV-2067) 
 
 
 
For those with no risk factors, the median time to resolution was 3 days shorter with 2400 mg vs. 
placebo (data not shown). 
 
There were also benefits in terms of prevention of any MAV, as summarised in Table 37.

R10987-10933-COV-2069: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study 
Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies in 
Preventing SARSCoV- 2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals Infected with SARS-CoV-
2 
Methods 
The study design is depicted in Figure 18. 
Figure 18. Study COV-2069 flow diagram 
 
 
Study Participants  
Study participants were asymptomatic, healthy adults and children (including those with a chronic, 
stable medical condition) who were household contacts to the first known household member with a 
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case). Participants themselves could have been positive or 
negative for SARS-CoV-2 at screening. 
Study participants included adults and adolescents (age >12 years) and paediatric participants (age 
<12 years).  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 85/147
 
To be included in the study, subjects must be randomized within 96 hours of collection of the index 
cases’ positive SARS-COV-2 diagnostic test sample anticipates living in the same household with the 
index case until study day 29. 
The most salient exclusion criteria were: 
• 
Subject-reported history of prior positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test or positive SARS-CoV-2 
serology test at any time before the screening 
• 
Subject has lived with individuals who have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or currently 
lives with individuals who have SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the exception of the index case(s), 
the first individual(s) known to be infected in the household 
• 
Current hospitalization or was hospitalized (i.e., >24 hours) for any reason within 30 days of the 
screening visit 
• 
Received an investigational or approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
• 
Received investigational or approved passive antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 infection prophylaxis 
(e.g., convalescent plasma or sera, monoclonal antibodies, hyperimmuneglobulin) 
• 
Use of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine for prophylaxis/treatment of SARS-CoV-2 or anti-SARS-
viral agents, e.g., remdesivir, within 60 days of screening NOTE: 
hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine for other uses, e.g., for use in autoimmune diseases is allowed 
Patients were allocated to 4 different cohorts 
Cohort A: SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Negative at Baseline- adult and adolescent subjects  
Cohort A1: SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Negative at Baseline- paediatric subjects (<12 years) 
Cohort B: SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Positive at Baseline- adult and adolescent subjects will be enrolled 
Cohort B1: SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Positive at Baseline- paediatric subjects (<12 years) 
No paediatric participants were enrolled at the time of the randomization cut-off for this CSR. Cohort A1 
and B1 are not included in this report. 
Treatments 
Treatment was to be administered within 96 h of the index case sample in which the presence of SARS-
CoV-2 was confirmed.  
The REGN10987 and  REGN10933 dose is 1200 mg (600 mg of each mAb) SC single dose on day 1. The 
two components of Ronapreve were provided as 120 mg/mL solutions for SC or IM injection. All adult or 
adolescent subjects will receive 4 SC injections of study drug on day 1, each injection containing 2.5 mL 
of active study drug or placebo. 
Objectives/Outcomes/Endpoints 
Cohort A 
Primary and key secondary objectives/endpoints were defined for participants who were negative for 
SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., uninfected) and seronegative at baseline. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 86/147
 
 
 
Cohort B 
Primary and key secondary objectives/endpoints were defined for participants who were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., with asymptomatic infection) and seronegative at baseline. 
 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 87/147
 
 
Sample size 
It was estimated that the total enrolment may reach approximately 3500 adult and adolescent subjects 
and 250 paediatric subjects. The rationale for the overall expected sample size of 3500 adult/adolescent 
subjects was not presented, but further considerations were made for cohorts A and B. 
Cohort A 
To detect a relative risk of 0.5 (i.e., 50% reduction of the assumed 10% attack rate in the placebo 
arm), equivalent to an odds ratio of 0.47, power was calculated compared to the p-value of 0.05 based 
on 2000 simulations in 1248 subjects from 430 households (i.e., assuming an average household size of 
2.9 seronegative subjects). Based on simulation, at least 1980 subjects were planned to be enrolled in 
cohort A to have a minimum of 1248 seronegative subjects, assuming that 10% of subjects drop out 
and 30% of subjects are seropositive at baseline. This was expected to provide >90% power using a 
generalized linear model with the generalized estimation equation (GEE) approach and assuming a 
compound symmetry covariance matrix. 
Cohort B 
The sample size consideration of cohort B was based on the frequency of finding positive subjects while 
enrolling cohort A and assumed that approximately 10% of subjects in a household would be already 
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR at baseline. Among approximately 3500 adult and adolescent 
subjects that were anticipated to be enrolled in cohort A or cohort B, the number of subjects expected 
in cohort B was approximately 220, including 200 seronegative subjects. Assuming that 50% of infected 
placebo subjects at baseline would develop symptoms, 200 seronegative subjects in cohort B was 
expected to provide >90% power to detect a relative risk of 0.5 using a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at an 
alpha level of 0.05. 
The sample size was amended through protocol amendments, and assumptions were verified through 
an unplanned unblinded interim analysis, called “administrative assessment”. 
 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 88/147
 
Randomisation 
Subjects were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive REGN10987+ REGN10933 or placebo 
according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive web response system (IWRS) to 
the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization was planned to be performed 
by individual study subjects, not by households. 
In addition to a randomization number, all subjects randomized were planned to be given a household 
identification number in the case that multiple members of the same household are enrolled and receive 
study drug. This was planned to ensure that any correlation among subjects within the same household 
may be considered in the statistical analysis. 
Randomization was stratified as follows: 
• 
Site 
• 
Local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 from appropriate samples (positive, negative, or 
undetermined) 
• 
Age and/or weight: 
− 
<12 years and <10 kg, 
− 
<12 years and ≥10 kg to <20 kg, 
− 
<12 years and ≥20 kg 
− 
≥12 years and <18 years 
− 
≥18 years and <50 years 
− 
≥50 years 
Note that the cohorts used in the analysis are defined by the baseline central lab SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR 
results, not by the local diagnostic assay. 
 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blinded study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
Efficacy analyses were planned to be conducted on the seronegative modified full analysis set 
(seronegative mFAS). The seronegative mFAS was defined as follows for each of the cohorts: 
Seronegative Modified Full Analysis Set (Seronegative mFAS-A) - Cohort A 
The seronegative modified full analysis set for cohort A (seronegative mFAS-A) was planned to include 
all randomized subjects aged 12 years and older who are laboratory confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 
(per central lab PCR test) and who test negative for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 (per central lab serology 
testing) at baseline. 
Subjects included in the administrative assessment analysis were planned to be excluded from the 
seronegative mFAS-A population. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 89/147
 
Subjects were planned to be analysed based on the randomized treatment assignment. The 
seronegative mFAS-A population was planned to be the primary analysis population for the primary and 
secondary endpoints for cohort A of this study unless specified otherwise. 
Seronegative Modified Full Analysis Set (Seronegative mFAS-B) - Cohort B 
The seronegative modified full analysis set for cohort B (seronegative mFAS-B) was planned to include 
all randomized subjects aged 12 years and older who have laboratory confirmed positive tests at 
baseline for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and negative SARS-CoV-2 serology (both based on central lab 
testing) and are asymptomatic at baseline. 
Subjects were planned to be analysed based on the randomized treatment assignment. The primary and 
secondary endpoints for cohort B were planned to be analysed using the seronegative mFAS-B unless 
otherwise specified. 
The primary analysis was restricted to subjects who did not have evidence of previous or ongoing 
infection because this was thought to be the most vulnerable population who were likely to get infected. 
Inclusion of patients with prior immunity would not meaningfully contribute to an assessment of 
RONAPREVE treatment effects versus placebo and would merely inflate the sample size required to have 
enough events (asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections) necessary to complete the trial. 
Nevertheless, a small number of prior infected patients (seropositive patients) and serostatus 
undermined patients were enrolled. The sample size is also small for the seropositive patients and 
patients with undetermined serostatus. The data suggested that the treatment effect was not driven by 
the asymptomatic early infected population, regardless of serostatus 
Cohorts (and thereby analysis sets) were defined by means of central laboratory assessment for both 
PCR as well as serology testing, whereas randomization was planned to be stratified by Local diagnostic 
assay for SARS-CoV-2 from appropriate samples (positive, negative, or undetermined).  
Variable and analysis model 
The primary efficacy variable for Cohort A was planned to be the Proportion of subjects who have a 
symptomatic RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (broad-term) during the EAP. 
A mixed model was planned as primary analysis with a fixed effect model as fall-back strategy: 
In order to account for the correlation among subjects within a household and control the associated 
type 1 error inflation, a generalized linear model was planned to be used to estimate the odds ratio 
between the treatment groups by using the GEE approach. This model estimates a single within-
household correlation coefficient. The model was planned to include the fixed category effects of 
treatment group (placebo versus REGN10933+REGN10987), region (US versus ex-US), and age (≥12 
to <50, ≥50 years). The model was planned to use a compound symmetry covariance matrix and 
estimate the odds ratio between the treatment groups and corresponding 95% CI and p-value. 
Fall-back strategies: If the GEE model fails to converge due to most households containing only a single 
study subject in seronegative mFAS-A or the percentage of households in cohort A with only a single 
study subject is 70% or more, then a logistic regression model was planned to be used, with treatment, 
region, and age group as fixed effects. The threshold of 70% was based on simulations of within-
household correlation which suggest that the type I error rate is inflated, and the power is decreased 
when the proportion of single-subject households is high (further information in the SAP).  
If the logistic regression model does not converge, an exact logistic regression was planned to be used. 
The estimates of odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CI and p-value were then planned to be provided 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 90/147
 
from logistic regression (or exact logistic regression) for comparison of REGN10933+REGN10987 
against placebo group. 
The primary efficacy variable for Cohort B was planned to be the Proportion of subjects who 
subsequently develop signs and symptoms (broad-term) within 14 days of a positive RT-qPCR at 
baseline or during the EAP. 
The same statistical methods as described for cohort A were planned to be used to obtain the estimate 
of odds ratio and p-value for comparison between the treatment groups. 
Missing values 
Subjects with COVID-19 symptoms that are missing a central lab-determined RT-qPCR test during the 
EAP (e.g., are too sick to go to the study site) but have a positive SARS-COV-2 test from a local lab 
(e.g., in the hospital) were planned to be considered as having a symptomatic infection if any of the 
symptoms occurred within 14 days of the positive SARS-COV-2 test(s). 
Significance level and multiplicity 
The overall type I error was planned to be controlled in each of seronegative mFAS-A and seronegative 
mFAS-B independently at 2-sided 5% significance level. The applicant argued that cohorts A and B 
could be interpreted as independent studies. This was not fully agreed, mainly due to practicalities in 
prospectively identifying the cohorts. In consequence, there are uncertainties in the interpretation of 
statistical significance. 
 
If the primary efficacy endpoint in cohort A or cohort B is statistically significant, the alpha level of 0.05 
was planned to be released for the key secondary endpoints in cohort A or cohort B respectively. The 
hierarchical testing sequence for key secondary efficacy endpoints is presented in Table 39 (cohort A) 
and Table 40 (cohort B).

Previously planned interim analyses were removed in protocol amendment 6. 
An initially unplanned unblinded “administrative assessment” was conducted with data of all 554 
subjects in cohort A randomized on or before 16 Oct 2020, based on a database snapshot on 19 Jan 
2021. None of the data from these 554 subjects were to be included in the primary efficacy analysis for

Protocol deviations 
Approximately 3% of participants in cohort A and 6% in cohort B had important protocol deviations 
during the study, and incidences were comparable between treatment groups.  
In the baseline seronegative subgroup in Cohort B, 3/207 (1.4%) participants were randomized despite 
having symptomatic infection and were subsequently removed from the efficacy population. 
Baseline data 
Cohort A: 
In general, demographic characteristics are well balanced between the groups (Table 43). 
Table 43. Demographics (Seronegative, mFAS-A, Study COV-2069) 
 
 
Approximately 30% of baseline-seronegative participants in cohort A had risk factors at baseline for 
severe COVID-19 if they were to become infected (as defined in the SAP) and risk factors were 
generally balanced between treatment groups. Risk factors present in more than 10% of participants 
were BMI ≥35 kg/m2 and age ≥65 years with cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, or chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Fewer than 2% of participants were immunosuppressed (due to 
disease or to immunosuppressive treatment).  
Based on information collected during an interview with study participants at baseline, the 
characteristics of participants’ interaction with their index case were similar between the treatment 
groups. Approximately 30% in both treatment groups shared a bedroom with the index case at 
baseline, and approximately 95% shared a common room. 
Cohort B 
The Applicant decided to include only the data of a subset of Cohort B, namely Cohort B seronegative, in 
the main efficacy analysis. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 94/147
 
In general, demographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups beside some 
imbalances regarding the risk factors (Table 44).  
 
Table 44. Demographics (Seronegative, Randomised Subjects in Cohort B, Study COV-2069) 
 
 
 
More than 30% of participants had baseline risk factors for severe COVID-19 if they were to become 
infected groups. Risk factors present in more than 10% of participants were age ≥65 years, BMI ≥35 
kg/m2 and age ≥55 years with CVD, hypertension, or COPD. In each treatment group, ≤3% of 
participants were immunosuppressed (due to disease or to immunosuppressive treatment). More 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group had a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (16.0% vs 10.6% in the 
placebo group). More participants in the placebo group had diabetes (10.6% vs 5.0% in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group). Other risk factors were generally balanced between the treatment 
groups, with a difference in incidence <5%.

Outcomes and estimation 
Cohort A: Negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR status at baseline 
Effect on symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 
In mFAS-A, there was an 81.4% relative risk reduction for symptomatic, RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection (broad-term) in the REGN-COV2 group vs. placebo (Table 46).

The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection diverged between the treatment groups by day 8 
(i.e., the first post-baseline NP swab sample collection), and a reduced incidence compared to placebo 
was maintained in the casirivimab+imdevimab group through day 29 (Figure 19).

Ancillary analyses 
Seropositive subjects at baseline 
 
In the overall group regardless of baseline serostatus, REGN-COV2 gave a statistically significant 
reduction in symptomatic infections. In the subset that was seropositive at baseline, REGN-COV2 
numerically reduced the risk of symptomatic infections by 81% based on a total of 6 cases (5 on 
placebo). 
 
Effect on viral load 
 
There was an 86% relative risk reduction in the proportion of subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load 
(>104 copies/ml) infection for REGN-COV2 vs. placebo (Table 48). 
 
Table 48. Proportion of participants with high viral load (>4 log10 copies/mL) in NP swab samples 
during the EAP (Seronegative mFAS-A, Study COV-2069) 
 
 
 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 97/147
 
Consistent with this finding, there was a 90% reduction in the number of weeks of high viral load for 
REGN-COV2 vs. placebo. 
 
In those who became infected with SARS-CoV-2, REGN-COV2 treatment prevented high viral load in 
symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Furthermore, REGN-COV2-treated subjects exhibited 
decreased peak viral load vs. placebo and a shorter duration of viral shedding (Table 49).

Summary of events after Day 29 
 
There were more infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in the placebo group compared to the 
REGN-COV2 group after Day 29.  
A first onset of any RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) from Day 
29 occurred in 2/753 (0.3%) in the REGN-COV2 group vs. 25/752 (3.3%) in the placebo group (Figure

Cohort B (positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR status at baseline) 
Effect on progression to symptomatic infection 
Efficacy analyses for cohort B were conducted using the seronegative modified full analysis set (mFAS-
B), which consisted of randomised participants with asymptomatic infection (i.e., positive for SARS-CoV-
2 per central lab RT-qPCR test) and who did not test positive for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline 
(per central lab serology testing), during the EAP. 
In the mFAS-B, there was a statistically significant risk reduction in development of symptomatic

Ancillary analyses 
Seropositive subjects at baseline 
 
For all subjects regardless of baseline serostatus, Ronapreve reduced the risk of symptomatic infections 
by 35%, which reached statistical significance. In the seropositive subset of Cohort B based on 9 cases, 
Ronapreve reduced the risk of symptomatic infections by 34%. Baseline seropositive subjects had a

lower rate of development of symptomatic infection compared to baseline seronegative subjects 
(44/104; 42.3% vs. 5/38; 13.2%). 
 
Effect on viral load 
 
In the mFAS-B, there was a 40% reduction in the number of weeks (based on mean per subject and 
cumulative across all subjects in each group) of high viral load infection for Ronapreve vs. placebo 
(Table 52).

Design 
This is an adaptive, seamless, phase 1/2/3, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-
controlled master protocol to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
casirivimab+imdevimab combination therapy in ambulatory patients (i.e., 
outpatients) with COVID-19. Phase 1 and phase 2 have completed, while phase 3 
is ongoing (for safety assessment only).  
8 months duration  
first patient, first visit: 16 June 
2020 
In phase 3, details of COVID-19-related 
medically attended visits are collected 
throughout the study up to day 29, with 
collection occurring minimally on a weekly 
basis.  
The trial is still ongoing because the 
assessment of safety continues to Day 169.

Phases and 
protocol 
amendments  
Seamless design. This is an adaptive seamless phase 1/2/3 study. A number of 
patients were initially enrolled in phase 3 prior to completion of the phase 1/2 
analysis and subsequent phase 3 design adaptations. As a result, patients in 
cohort 1 of phase 3 initially continued the randomization scheme designed in 
phase 2, and were thus randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of placebo, or to a 
single IV dose of RONAPREVE 2400 mg or 8000 mg.  
Randomisation Dose Groups. Based on the results of the primary efficacy 
analysis in phase 1/2, phase 3 was amended (protocol amendment 6) such that 
subsequent patients in cohort 1 were randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of 
placebo, or to a RONAPREVE single IV dose of 1200 mg, or, 2400 mg. As of 25 Feb 
2021, per IDMC recommendation, patients were randomized 1:1 to single IV dose 
of RONAPREVE 2400mg or 8000mg (no placebo).   
Risk Factor. The amended portion of phase 3 also required, as a condition of 
enrolment, that patients have symptomatic COVID-19 at baseline and at least 1 
risk factor for developing severe COVID-19.  The risk factor requirements are 
reflected in the primary efficacy analysis set.  
Swab Sampling Schedule. Prior to the amended portion of phase 3, NP swabs 
were collected according to the dense sampling schedule employed in phase 2. 
After phase 3 was amended, NP swab sample collection was reduced to 
approximately once weekly.  Cohort 2 and cohort 3 were added to phase 3 in the 
amended portion.  
Cohorts. This tabular summary only includes patients randomized to cohort 1 on 
or prior to 17 Jan 2021.  Cohort 1 is adult outpatients (≥18 years). Cohorts 2 and 
3 were excluded from this efficacy analysis: cohort 2 were adolescent outpatients 
(<18 years at randomisation) and cohort 3 were outpatients (pregnant at 
randomisation).

Phases and populations and

Cohorts of trial subjects.  Two distinct study populations were 
analysed. Cohort A analyses evaluated infection prevention in 
participants who were uninfected at baseline, and cohort B 
evaluated early treatment to prevent symptomatic progression in 
participants with asymptomatic infection at baseline. For efficacy 
analysis, cohort allocation was based on results from the central 
laboratory assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR status at baseline: 
participants who were negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., uninfected) 
were allocated to cohort A, and participants who were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., with asymptomatic infection) were allocated to 
cohort B.  Cohort A and B had separate efficacy analyses, each with 
its own alpha allocation and testing hierarchy. During trial conduct, 
subjects were randomised according to local laboratory testing.    
 
 
Administrative Assessment.  In the absence of a phase 2 clinical 
trial, protocol amendment 5 (19 January 2021) introduced an 
administrative assessment of unblinded trial results. The data from 
554 cohort A subjects (who were randomised up to 16 October 
2020) were used to verify assumptions about infection rates and 
adequacy of sample size. Consequently, the sample size was 
increased from 2000 subjects to 3500 subjects (adults and 
adolescents) to accommodate the observed higher non-
seronegativity rate and the unblinded administrative assessment. 
The planned total study population comprised ~3150 subjects in 
cohort A and ~350 subjects in cohort B, including the 554 subjects 
in the administrative assessment and approximately 250 paediatric 
subjects <12 years old (~225 subjects in cohort A1 and 25 subjects 
in cohort B1), with household contact exposure to an individual with 
a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rationales for the primary 
and secondary objectives and endpoints were revised after the 
administrative assessment.  The subjects who were included in the 
administrative assessment are excluded from the phase 3 efficacy 
analysis. In 409 out of 554 participants without prior infection (i.e., 
baseline-seronegative), the proportion of participants with 
symptomatic events in the RONAPREVE group was 0% (0/186) 
compared to 3.6% (8/223) in the placebo group. The 554 cohort A 
participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis population 
(i.e. seronegative mFAS) presented below (but were included in the 
safety analysis for cohort A). The administrative assessment did not 
include cohort B.

Analyses were conducted to 
determine whether treatment of an 
index case with RONAPREVE had any 
impact on the incidence of SARS-CoV-
2 infection in household contacts. Of 
the participants who developed SARS-
CoV-2 infection following exposure to 
an index case who was participating 
in Study COV-2067, the proportion of 
index cases who received treatment 
No interaction was observed as the proportion of infected 
participants in the placebo group in COV-2069 was similar 
regardless of whether the index case received product or 
placebo in Study COV-2067 (10/51 [19.6%] vs 23/116 
[19.8%] participants, respectively; p=1.0000). Treatment of 
the index case with product in Study COV-2067 therefore did

HV-2093 
 
This randomised and placebo-controlled study assesses the safety and PK of repeat subcutaneous (SC) 
administrations of Ronapreve at 4-week intervals. Eligible subjects were adults up to age 90 years who 
were healthy or had stable underlying medical conditions.  
 
During the screening period, subjects were to have a negative result for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR by a 
central laboratory test applied to a NP swab obtained within 72 h of randomisation. Alternatively, 
screening assessment for SARS-CoV-2 infection could be based on a local test using an approved 
diagnostic assay. If the local test was negative and the subject was enrolled but the central laboratory 
result for the screening swab was subsequently reported as positive, subjects were to be discontinued. 
Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted at baseline and was then to be repeated at weeks 25 
(end of treatment period - EOTP) and week 53 (end of study – EOS). Subjects were discontinued if a 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. 
 
Subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive six SC doses of 1200 mg Ronapreve or placebo.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 110/147
 
The primary endpoints are: 
 
• Incidence of AESIs that occur within 4 days of SC administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 or 
placebo at baseline and days 29, 57, 85, 113 and 141 
• Concentration of REGN10933 and REGN10987 in serum over time 
 
All analyses of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy were descriptive. 
 
According to protocol amendment 4, the treatment assignment of individual subjects could be unblinded 
on consideration by the investigator to allow the individual to receive vaccination against COVID-19 with 
a 90-day minimum interval from last receipt of Ronapreve.  
 
Subjects who were unblinded were discontinued, whether they went on to receive vaccination.  
 
 
Results 
 
The applicant provided an interim analysis with a data cut off on 13 March 2021 and a lock date of 13 
April 2021 based on 974 randomised subjects, of which 969 received at least one dose of assigned 
study treatment. One subject randomised to placebo received a dose of 1200 mg Ronapreve and is 
counted in the Ronapreve group. 
 
At the time of the data cut off, no subjects had reached end of study (day 28 after the week 24 dose). 
There had been 111 discontinuations from treatment, of which 53 discontinued from study. Of the total, 
13 discontinued due to COVID-19 (10 placebo and 3 Ronapreve; see further below). The mean age for 
the population was 47 years, with 13% aged ≥65 years, and 55% were of male gender. 
 
At baseline, 6 subjects (0.6%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on the central 
laboratory RT-PCR and 85 (8.8%) had positive serology (at least one of anti-spike IgA or IgG or anti-N 
IgG). The subjects who were RT-PCR positive for the virus were discontinued from further study doses 
but were followed for safety. The seropositive subjects continued in the study. 
 
At the data cut off, ~60% had received all 6 doses of assigned treatment and >80% had received 5 
doses. Study drug adherence was high (>96%) in both groups. 
 
Since the assessment of efficacy was exploratory, cases of symptomatic COVID-19 (not necessarily RT-
PCR confirmed) were captured as AEs. During the 6-month treatment period, there was a 91.8% 
relative risk reduction for symptomatic COVID-19 in the Ronapreve group vs. placebo group. This was 
based on 15 cases (3 on active and 12 on placebo).

Nine of 12 cases in the placebo group had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result or seroconverted 
whereas 0/3 subjects in the REGN-COV2 group were RT-PCR positive or seroconverted by the end of the 
treatment period. 
 
A similar estimate of efficacy applied when counting all cases since there was only one additional case 
during follow-up and that occurred in the placebo group. 
 
At baseline, ~67% per group were seronegative as defined above. By the time of cut off, 8/162 (4.9%) 
in the placebo group but none in the Ronapreve group had seroconverted. 5/238 (2.1%) in the placebo 
group who were RT-PCR negative at baseline subsequently had a positive result vs. none of 719 in the 
Ronapreve group. Since routine RT-PCR testing was not conducted post-baseline in this study, it is 
presumed that these 5 placebo subjects were among those who had symptomatic COVID-19.  
 
COV-2066 
 
This is an adaptive Phase 1/2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ronapreve in adults 
hospitalised for ≤72 hours prior to randomisation due to COVID-19. Eligible subjects were to have a 
SARS-CoV-2-positive antigen or molecular diagnostic test using an appropriate sample obtained ≤72 
hours prior to randomisation and no alternative explanation for their clinical condition. Symptoms at 
baseline were to be consistent with COVID-19 as determined by investigator with onset ≤10 days 
before randomization.  
 
Subjects were to be enrolled into four cohorts based on disease severity at randomisation. Those who 
met >1 criterion were to be included in the most severely affected category: 
 
Cohort 1A: With COVID-19 symptoms but not requiring supplemental oxygen 
Cohort 1: Maintains O2 saturation >93% on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, simple face mask or 
other similar device (saturation was corrected for altitude above sea level) 
Cohort 2: High-intensity oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation, defined as supplemental 
oxygen via: 
− Non-rebreather mask (with SpO2 ≤96% on oxygen flow rate of at least 10 L/min) 
− High-flow device (e.g. AIRVO™ or Optiflow™) with at least 50% FiO2 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 112/147
 
− Non-invasive ventilator, including CPAP 
Cohort 3: On mechanical ventilation 
 
Due to IDMC recommendations, enrolment into cohorts 2 and cohort 3 is on hold.  
 
Subjects were randomised (1:1:1) to receive single IV doses of Ronapreve 2400 mg or 8000 mg or 
placebo. Randomisation was stratified by country (Phase 2 only) and the type of background standard-
of-care being administered for COVID-19 at randomisation (Phase 1 and 2) as follows: 
• Antiviral therapies only (e.g. remdesivir) 
• Non-antiviral therapies: Immune-based therapies, both antiviral and immune-based therapies or no 
COVID-19-specific treatment. 
 
The primary objectives of the phase 1/2 (Cohort 1) of the study was to exclude futility of Ronapreve 
vs. placebo based on rates of death or mechanical ventilation 
 
Serial NP swabs were collected every other day for the first 2 weeks and then twice weekly to determine 
viral load by SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and changes over time.  
 
 
Analyses and sample size 
 
The sample size for Cohort 1 assumed accrual of 35 events (death or mechanical ventilation) and a 
cumulative incidence of death or mechanical ventilation in the placebo group of 25% at day 29 (derived 
from the sarilumab study in COVID-19 subjects receiving low flow oxygen supplementation at baseline, 
with an assumption of twice this rate in the seronegative mFAS). Applying a futility threshold of α=0.3 
(1-sided), the minimum HR between Ronapreve (pooled dose groups) vs. placebo that excludes futility 
is 0.827 (i.e. minimum risk reduction 17.3%). If the observed risk reduction is ~17% or lower, the 
assessment of efficacy would be declared futile. 
 
It was estimated that 43 total events in the seronegative mFAS were needed to achieve 80% power to 
detect a risk reduction of 50% (HR=0.5) between Ronapreve group vs. placebo, at α=0.1 (one sided) 
level of significance. Assuming patients are followed through day 29, accrual takes 90 days and 30% of 
the FAS are eligible for the seronegative mFAS, 250 subjects were required across 3 arms. 
 
 
Results 
 
The analysis submitted by the applicant is based on the study population enrolled by 01 Dec 2020.  
 
The Phase 1/2 portion consisted of the first 671 subjects randomised and treated in Cohort 1 and all 
subjects randomised and treated in Cohort 2 (n=161) and Cohort 3 (n=35). While efficacy is reported 
for the subjects in Cohort 1, safety is reported for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 up to the data cut off.  
 
Subject disposition in Cohort 1 is summarised in Figure 28.

Demographic characteristics and baseline virology and disease characteristics in the Cohort 1 FAS 
population (n=671) were generally comparable across the treatment groups.  
 
The same pattern applied to the mFAS population (n=533), defined as patients that were central lab 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive at baseline from NP swab sample. However, there was a 
significantly higher viral load in the seronegative subsets vs. the seropositive subsets. 
 
The initial futility analysis was conducted on a 09 Dec 2020 data cut, by which time all subjects had a 
minimum of 8 days of follow-up and 487 patients had at least 28 days of follow-up. Based on this data 
cut, futility was excluded in seronegative hospitalised patients on low flow oxygen, with a 22% 
reduction in the risk of death or mechanical ventilation for the pooled Ronapreve dose groups vs. 
placebo (p = 0.23, which was below the pre-specified α = 0.3 [1-sided]). There was a 26.3% relative 
risk reduction in the proportion progressing to death or ventilation. 
 
Using a data cut of 19 Jan 2021, by which time all subjects had achieved at least 28 days of follow-up, 
there was a 29% reduction in the risk of death or mechanical ventilation in baseline seronegatives for 
pooled Ronapreve groups vs. placebo (p = 0.14, which was also below the pre-specified α = 0.3 [1-
sided]).  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 114/147
 
A post-hoc proportions analysis applied to the second data cut revealed a 31.5% relative risk reduction 
for pooled Ronapreve dose groups vs. placebo in the proportion of baseline seronegatives who died or 
went on mechanical ventilation (p=0.095).  
 
There was no apparent advantage for the higher Ronapreve dose group when each was compared to 
placebo in the baseline seronegative subsets. There were trends for risk reduction for death or 
mechanical ventilation for pooled Ronapreve dose groups vs. placebo in subsets of the mFAS with high 
baseline viral load (>106 and >107 copies/mL). Also, the trend to treatment benefit was observed 
regardless of the background concomitant COVID-19 therapies used, such as remdesivir or 
dexamethasone. 
 
Using the second data cut, the benefit (on clinical endpoints) with Ronapreve seemed to start 
approximately 8 days after treatment. Additional analyses were done to evaluate the effect of 
Ronapreve from day 9 to 29, which showed a risk reduction of 69% (p = 0.006) in death or mechanical 
ventilation for baseline seronegative subjects.  
 
In the placebo group 26.9% of seronegative vs. 11.6% of seropositive subjects progressed to death or 
mechanical ventilation. There was no appreciable benefit of Ronapreve in the baseline seropositive 
subsets although there was also no excess risk of progression to ventilation or death.  
 
 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study COV-2067 is the pivotal study supporting the claimed indication of “treatment of confirmed 
COVID-19 in patients aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg that do not require 
supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19”. 
Non-hospitalised patients with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, as determined by the investigator, 
with onset ≤7 days before randomisation who have a positive diagnostic test for SARSCoV-2 were 
enrolled in the study. SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnostic test from a sample collected ≤72 hours prior to 
randomisation, using a validated SARS-CoV-2 antigen, RT-PCR, or other molecular diagnostic assay is 
an inclusion criterion. With amendment 6 phase 3 of the study was amended; patients in cohort 1 were 
enrolled if they had ≥1 risk factor for severe COVID-19   
In Phase 1/2 two doses, namely 2400 mg and 8000 mg of casirivimab+imdevimab were explored. After 
completion of the Phase 1/2 a lower dose of 1200 mg of casirivimab+imdevimab was introduced in the 
ongoing Phase 3 study via amendment. The applicant was asked to clarify and to discuss how the late 
addition of a third dose arm (1200mg) might have impacted the balancing properties, and it was agreed 
that the impact was minor. 
It is evident through the changes to the ongoing study that uncertainty was high at the initial planning 
stage and the trial underwent repeated refinement in light of accumulating information in an adaptive 
design approach. This is understood and acceptable in the pandemic situation, however some 
uncertainty remains and warrants discussion.  
There was some uncertainty around the stopping criteria and the decision to unblind the data before the 
event-driven criteria, which had been used for the power calculations, were reached. The applicant 
confirmed that these rules were not considered, as the decision to stop enrolment was entirely based on  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 115/147
 
the recommendation by the DMC. However, the applicant also confirmed that the information from the 
ongoing phase 3 part of the study on observed events, was not used in amendments to the sample size 
or analysis of phase 3 cohort 1.  Enrolment to the placebo arm in phase 3 was also stopped upon 
recommendation by the independent data monitoring committee. Following this decision, an interim 
analysis for the 1200 mg vs placebo arm was introduced in amendment 8. The applicant was asked to 
discuss the expected timing of the “final analysis” as compared to the timing of the “interim analysis” 
and justify the need for the interim analysis of 1200 mg vs placebo. Whilst the motivation around the 
late introduction of the interim analysis could not be verified, in view of the positive results it was 
agreed that this was unlikely to have a significant impact on the outcomes of the study.    
The analysis of interim data was submitted, in which overrunning data were considered relevant. The 
applicant was asked to update the primary and key secondary results, including all concurrent patients 
in the comparisons of 2400mg vs placebo and 1200mg vs placebo, respectively. This analysis was 
consistent with the initial interim analysis.   
The primary outcome variable of COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death was analysed by 
means of a stratified CMH test for country. The approach to the primary analysis is considered 
reasonable. Changes were made to the primary endpoint and analysis model (previously a logrank-test 
for time to medically attended visits), but due to the rather short follow-up of 29 days for the primary 
endpoint, the dichotomous analysis seems more reasonable than the initially planned time-to-event 
endpoint.  
Analyses of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints in these studies were conducted at a two-
sided significance level of α=0.05 utilizing a hierarchical testing strategy to control for type I error 
(Table 22). 
The primary analysis in phase 3 was conducted only in patients with ≥1 risk factor (introduced via 
Amendment 6 to the protocol) which was influenced by the results of the phase 1/2 results. This raised 
some uncertainty on whether the analysis sets optimally reflect clinical practise. However, the applicant 
provided results in the FAS with ≥1 risk factor, including subjects without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 
infection by PCR test which was consistent with the results from the primary analysis 
The Applicant also provided  a comparison of the demographics and baseline characteristics, excluding 
Virology and serostatus between Phase 3 mFAS overall, Phase 3 mFAS pre-amendment 6, Phase 3 
mFAS post and Phase 3 Phase (all ≥1 risk factor, PCR positive) and Phase 3 FAS (no risk factors, PCR 
positive).Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar were similar between the 4 risk factor 
populations.  
 
 
Prevention 
Study COV-2069 
Study COV-2069 is an ongoing, global, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy 
and safety study conducted in individuals at high-risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 due to 
living with a known SARS-CoV-2-infected household member. Participants were randomized 1:1 to 
receive a single SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg or placebo. 
Study participants were asymptomatic, healthy adults and children (including those with a chronic, 
stable medical condition) who were household contacts to the first known household member with a 
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (index case). Several members of the same household could be 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 116/147
 
included in the study. Participants themselves could have been negative (cohort A) or positive (B) for 
SARS-CoV-2 at screening. 
An initially unplanned unblinded analysis, called administrative assessment was conducted for which 
there was concern that it could have affected the integrity of the study. 
The applicant explained that there was some uncertainty despite blinded reassessment of some of the 
parameters and that this was the reason to conduct the administrative assessment. The applicant 
asserted that measures were taken to preserve integrity of the ongoing study and that the subjects 
analysed in the administrative assessment were excluded from further analyses of efficacy. This is 
supported, to avoid further inflation of type-I-error despite the fact the results of the administrative 
assessment were known to study personnel. 
The study was planned to include approximately 3500 subjects, in order to have sufficient power to 
show a treatment effect in Cohorts A and B. There were uncertainties at the planning stage about 
household sizes and correlations, distribution of subjects across the cohorts and the distribution of the 
outcome variable. Accordingly, the sample size was reassessed during the ongoing study. The applicant 
asserted that assessment of the relevant parameters proportion of subjects with 
symptomatic/asymptomatic infections and the sero-positivity rate at baseline and household size was 
done without breaking the blind (except for the unblinded administrative assessment). The applicant 
confirmed that measures were taken to preserve integrity of the study. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg or placebo. The applicant stated 
that randomization was stratified for study site as well as local diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 and 
age which is supported,  
Analyses of the primary and key secondary endpoints were conducted at a two-sided α=0.05 utilizing a 
hierarchical testing strategy to control for type I error. This was specified separately for each of the 
cohorts A and B. No strong control of type I error on the study level was implemented. The applicant 
argued that cohorts A and B should be interpreted as two independent studies, but this was not agreed 
by CHMP, mainly because of practicalities of identifying the cohorts. In consequence there were 
uncertainties around the interpretation of statistical significance. 
The primary efficacy variable, the proportion of subjects who have a symptomatic RT-qPCR confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 28 day efficacy assessment period, was planned to be analysed by 
means of a generalized linear model to estimate the odds ratio using a GEE approach to account for 
household correlation. The model was planned to be adjusted for region and age. The applicant 
presented in the SAP a simulation study discussing the impact of household correlation and household 
size on the statistical properties of this model and concluded that type-I-error is inflated if the 
proportion of households with only one study participant is large. Accordingly, the applicant defined a 
fall-back-strategy by means of a logistic regression adjusted for region and age and ignoring household. 
This fall-back method was in the end applied. Although households may play a role (within cohorts, and 
across cohorts A and B), this is not considered critical, and the fall-back strategy is endorsed. 
The applicant confirmed that amendment 6, dated 25 March 2021 was finalized prior to the database 
lock and unblinding of the treatment assignment on 30 March 2021. Although the timing is not optimal 
and the late changes may have carried a risk to the integrity of the study, the applicant’s response is 
considered sufficiently convincing and there is currently no reason to believe that decisions were data 
driven. 
As of the cut-off dates for this CSR, 3096 participants were screened for the study. A total of 3029 
participants were randomised, of whom 3002 were treated and were presented by cohort. Upon request 
the Applicant stated that in study COV-2069, of the 3096 subjects who were screened, 83 subjects 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 117/147
 
discontinued during the screening phase. The majority (65/83) of the subjects who discontinued during 
the screening phase were screen failed due to reasons related to inclusion/exclusion criteria. An 
additional 18 subjects discontinued during the screening period, most commonly due to subject decision 
to not participate in the study. 
In general, demographic characteristics are well balanced between the groups (both cohorts). Of note, 
the Applicant decided to include only the data of a subset of Cohort B, namely Cohort B seronegative, in 
the main efficacy analysis. 
 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
 
Treatment 
Study COV-2067 
The primary and key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically and reached nominal statistical 
significance at the level of 5%. The updated analysis which included overrunning information is the one 
considered most relevant to assess the treatment effect of casirivimab+imdevimab.  
In patients with at least 1 risk factor for severe COVID-19 (phase 3 portion of COV-2067), treatment 
with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the proportion of patients with COVID-19-related hospitalization 
or all-cause death by approximately 70% across all dose groups (1200 mg, 2400 mg, and 8000 mg) 
compared to placebo. The primary endpoint hospitalization for COVID-19 or all-case death is a 
composite endpoint, however results are driven by the incidence of hospitalization, and the data 
currently do not allow any conclusion on an effect of treatment (neither positive nor negative) on the 
occurrence of death. Of note, the incidence of death was low. There were 7 deaths reported as of the 
data cut; 5 in the placebo group, 1 in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg group and 1 in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group). All considered related to advanced and progressive COVID-19 
disease. 
Post-hoc analysis across risk factor subgroups for severe COVID-10 disease showed similar clinical 
benefit in reduction in COVID-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death across all groups. 
No dose dependent effect was observed. However, for some groups / events the number were low and 
do not allow a firm conclusion e.g. immunocompromised patient.  
Casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg and 2400 mg both shortened the median time to symptom resolution 
by 3 day (median 10 days vs. 13 days for placebo). This finding lends support to the utility of 
treatment.  
 
Single IV doses of casirivimab+imdevimab resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the LS mean 
viral load (log10 copies/mL) from baseline to day 7 compared to placebo (-0.71 log10 copies/mL for 
1200 mg and -0.86 log10 copies/mL for 2400 mg; nominal p<0.0001 for both comparisons). 
Reductions were observed in the overall mFAS population. Similar trends were observed in other 
subgroups, including by baseline viral load and serologic status, with greater reductions in those with 
higher viral load and baseline seronegative status. 
For Study COV-2067 the data of Phase 3 in patients with > 1 risk factor (main efficacy population) as 
well as data in patients with no risk factor and in addition the Phase 1/2 data in patients with or without 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 118/147
 
risk factors were provided. The data of the Phase 1/2 part in patients with or without risk factors are 
consistent with the Phase 3 in patients with > 1 risk factor, a significant reduction of MAVs was 
observed. However, in Phase 3, in patients without risk factors the effect was smaller, and not 
significant. This suggest that the result of Phase 1 was driven by the patients with >risk factors.   
Study COV-20145 
In Study COV-20145 similar effect of reduction of MAVs was seen in all dose groups (2400 mg IV, 1200 
mg IV, 1200 mg SC, 600 mg IV, 600 mg SC, 300 mg IV), however the numbers are small to draw a 
robust conclusion. 
Prevention 
Study COV-2069 
Cohort A 
The primary and key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically and reached statistical significance at the 
level of 5% except the last in the pre-specified statistical testing hierarchy.  
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic infection by 
81.4% compared to placebo in uninfected participants (cohort A) who were seronegative at baseline 
(p<0.0001). Subgroup analyses were provided for the primary endpoint in cohort A to assess the 
consistency of results in participants with different demographic or other baseline characteristics. In 
general results demonstrated a consistent treatment effect across subpopulations, including subgroups 
based on age); race and ethnicity); gender, BMI, and region risk factors as defined in the SAP and 
household size 
The risk of developing a high viral load infection (>4 log10 copies/mL) was reduced by 85.8% in the 
treatment group compared to placebo (p<0.0001) 
The data indicate that active treatment of the index case in Study COV-2067 did not reduce the risk of 
symptomatic infection in the household contact compared to placebo. The outcome is not unexpected. 
Given the natural course of disease, participants in Study COV-2067 could have passed the infection to 
household contacts prior to treatment.  
 
Cohort B 
Efficacy analyses for cohort B were conducted using the seronegative modified full analysis set (mFAS-
B), which consisted of randomised participants with asymptomatic infection (i.e., positive for SARS-CoV-
2 per central lab RT-qPCR test) and who did not test positive for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline 
(per central lab serology testing), during the EAP.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically and reached nominal statistical 
significance at the two-sided level of 5%. Statistical significance was considered uncertain due to lack of 
strong type I error control over the two cohorts A and B. 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the risk of progression to symptomatic disease 
seronegative participants with asymptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline by 
31.5% compared to placebo (nominal p=0.0380). A consistent, but no longer significant effect was 
observed (relative risk reduction 25.3%, p=0.2329) when using a different laboratory assay to 
determine SARS-CoV-2 infection status. A consistent treatment effect was observed in participants 
regardless of baseline serology, with a 35.4% risk reduction compared to placebo (OR 0.54 [0.325, 
0.894], nominal p=0.0166). A comparable level of reduction was also shown when the analysis included

only baseline-positive participants (33.9% risk reduction vs placebo, OR 0.62 [0.147, 2.587], nominal 
p=0.5079), however not statistically significant (post hoc analysis). 
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary endpoint in cohort B. While event numbers were 
small in some of the subgroups, results generally showed a consistent treatment effect of 
casirivimab+imdevimab across subpopulations with different baseline characteristics, including age, 
race and ethnicity, gender, BMI, and region; risk factors as defined in the SAP and household size. 
Treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the duration of symptomatic infection (by broad term 
definition) by 45.3% compared to placebo (p=0.0273) (Table 38). 
The cumulative duration of high viral load infection was shorter by 39.7% after treatment with 
casirivimab+imdevimab compared to placebo (p=0.0010) 
In the ≥12 to <18 years of age uninfected subpopulation of COV-2069A, no participant (0/34) treated 
with casirivimab+imdevimab had symptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the EAP 
compared to 4/34 (11.8%) of placebo participants, corresponding to a 100% relative risk reduction in 
symptomatic infection compared to placebo.  
Data from COV-2069B showed that in the ≥12 to <18 years of age subpopulation, the proportion of 
participants with asymptomatic RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline who subsequently 
developed broad term signs and symptoms of COVID-19 was lower in the group that received a single 
SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab (n=2/15, 13.3%) compared to placebo (n=5/11, 45.5%), 
corresponding to a 70.7% reduction in the risk of progression to symptomatic disease. 
Overall Study Population 
Upon request, the applicant provided effect estimates in the overall population, comprising all 
randomised subjects. Results indicate that treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the risk of 
progression to symptomatic RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by 65.0% compared to placebo 
(nominal p<0.0001). 
 
HV-2093 
Study HV-2093 is an ongoing, phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, designed to 
assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses casirivimab+imdevimab SC given at monthly 
intervals in adult healthy volunteers who are SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline. 
Participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive up to 6 doses of casirivimab+imdevimab (600 
mg+600 mg) or placebo over 24 weeks. The treatment period lasted for up to 24 weeks (shorter if a 
participant developed a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or permanently discontinued from study 
drug), and there was a follow-up period of 28 weeks. 
While a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result excluded participants from the study, serology results were 
not part of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. This study also did not require that participants be 
withdrawn from study drug following positive serology results, which were made available by the central 
lab during the study. For the purpose of a PEP study it is adequate to exclude patients with a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at baseline from the efficacy analysis. However, patients with a positive of anti-
SARS-CoV-2 antibody are included in the study. This is understandable for the COVID-19 vaccine 
interaction sub-study (immunogenicity results not reported in the current submission).

Across all trials and regardless of the patient’s baseline serostatus the dose of 1200 mg of 
casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the relative risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. The interim data 
of Study HV-2093 are consistent with the data of Study COV-2069. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Primary and key secondary results support a treatment effect in reducing risk of hospitalization for 
COVID-19, especially in those patients with high viral load, and in reducing the time to symptom 
resolution.  
In patients negative for SARS-CoV-2 at screening and asymptomatic the primary and key secondary 
endpoints support an effect of reducing the risk of symptomatic infection and of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
with or without symptom and duration of infection. The risk of developing a high viral load infection was 
also reduced in the treatment group compared to placebo.  
In patients known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 who were determined to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 
at screening but asymptomatic for COVID-19 the primary and key secondary endpoints suggest that 
treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the risk of progression to symptomatic disease in 
seronegative participants. These findings are considered supportive of the prevention indication despite 
uncertainties of statistical significance in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. 
 
A consistent treatment effect was observed in participants regardless of baseline serology. A 
comparable level of reduction was also shown when the analysis included only baseline-positive 
participants however not statistically significant.  
Post-hoc analyses indicate that casirivimab+imdevimab reduces the risk of progression to symptomatic 
RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of whether subjects are already infected or not 
before initiation of prophylaxis. 
 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety evaluation is based on 7671 participants who received casirivimab+imdevimab either IV or 
SC in the randomized clinical studies contributing safety data to this application (Table 56). Of these 
participants: 
• 
5248 received a single dose casirivimab+imdevimab IV 
• 
1694 received a single dose casirivimab+imdevimab SC 
• 
729 received repeated administration of casirivimab+imdevimab SC Q4W x 6 doses.

Table 56. Duration of observation in individuals receiving casirivimab+imdevimab in clinical studies 
 
 
Under the CU program, from 13 Aug 2020 through 16 Apr 2021, a total of 236 patients (from multiple 
countries) were treated with casirivimab+imdevimab. Of these patients, 169 were treated under the 
physicians’ emergency INDs in US and 8 treated in other countries (5 in United Kingdom and 3 in Italy) 
under respective health authority approval, and 59 were Regeneron employees or their immediate 
family members who were treated under the Regeneron IND (Compassionate Use Tracker). 
Safety data in the abbreviated COV-2066 CSR submitted as part of the MAA are presented for the 
following cohorts: 
• 
Cohort 1 (hypoxic requiring low flow oxygen - phase 1 and 2) 
• 
Cohort 2 (hypoxic requiring non-invasive high flow oxygen - phase 2) 
• 
Cohort 3 (requiring mechanical ventilation - phase 2) 
Data from cohorts 1, 2, and 3 are each presented separately within the abbreviated CSR and within the 
corresponding tables and figures since each cohort represents a different hospitalized patient population 
with regards to disease severity.

Adverse events 
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145) 
Casirivimab+imdevimab was well tolerated in adult outpatients with COVID-19 (pooled phase 1/2/3 
safety data from COV-2067 and COV-21045). No dose-dependent pattern of AEs was observed, and no 
specific safety signal was identified in either study. 
In Study COV-2067 higher percentage of participants in the placebo group than in any 
casirivimab+imdevimab group experienced a grade 3 or 4 TEAE, treatment emergent SAE, or TEAE 
leading to a medically attended event regardless of COVID-19 relatedness (see Table 68). 
Across the IV dose groups in Study COV-20145 from day 1 through day 169, the highest percentage of 
participants experiencing a TEAE in any dose group was 19.0%, experienced by participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg IV group, while the lowest was 7.8%, experienced by participants in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg IV group. In comparison, 17.5% of participants in the placebo IV 
group experienced at least 1 TEAE. Across the SC dose groups from day 1 through day 169, the highest 
percentage of participants experiencing a TEAE in any dose group was 10.5%, experienced by 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC group, while the lowest was 4.4%, experienced 
by participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 600 mg SC group. In comparison, 10.3% of participants 
in the placebo SC group experienced at least 1 TEAE. 
Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093) 
• 
Study COV-2069 Cohort A 
With a cut-off date of July 01 2021, in Cohort A there were lower AE reporting rates in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group during the overall study period.  (Table 57).

The proportion of participants reporting non-COVID-19 TEAEs were comparable between the placebo 
and casirivimab+imdevimab groups. The majority of TEAEs was mild or moderate in severity (grade 1 
or grade 2) and < 2% of participants in either treatment group experienced SAEs or severe (grade 3 or 
grade 4) TEAEs.  
Five participants (2 [0.1%] in the placebo group and 3 [0.2%] in the casirivimab+imdevimab group) 
died during the study, all of which occurred during the follow-up period and all were considered 
unrelated to assigned treatment.   
Compared to the placebo group, more cohort A participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group 
reported treatment-related TEAE during the overall study period, consistent with a higher incidence of 
ISR in this treatment arm. Injection site reaction was also the most frequently reported treatment-
related TEAE in both treatment groups but none was grade ≥3. No other treatment-related TEAE was 
experienced by more than 3 participants in either treatment group. 
In the SOC of Skin or subcutaneous tissue disorder, 4 (0.3%) participants experienced treatment-
related TEAEs in the placebo group (PTs of Rash, Rash erythematous, and Drug eruption) and 1 
(<0.1%) participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab group (PT of Pruritis). With the exception of COVID-
19 and COVID-19 pneumonia, no other SAE was experienced by more than 2 participants in each 
treatment group. No participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab group experienced a COVID-19-related 
SAE. 
 
• 
Study COV-2069 Cohort B 
Fewer participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group reported TEAEs during the study period, and 
the number and proportion of participants reporting non-COVID-19 TEAEs were also smaller in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group compared to the placebo (Table 58).

I 
 
There were no deaths, AESIs or TEAEs resulting in study drug withdrawal. The majority of TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in severity (grade 1 or 2). Treatment-emergent SAEs occurred in 5 (2.9%) 
participants in the placebo group and 1 (0.6%) in the casirivimab+imdevimab group. 
The most often reported treatment-related TEAE was ISR in both treatment groups. No other 
treatment-related TEAE was experienced by more than 2 participants in either treatment group. In the 
SOC of Skin or subcutaneous tissue disorder, 2 (1.3%) participants experienced treatment-related 
TEAEs in the placebo group (PTs of Skin lesion and Rash erythematous). No treatment-related TEAEs in 
this SOC were reported in the casirivimab+imdevimab group. No SAE was considered related to study 
treatment by the investigator, and all SAEs were resolved. 
 
• 
Study COV-2069 Cohort Undetermined 
A greater proportion of placebo-treated participants reported TEAEs overall, but the incidence of non-
COVID-19-related TEAEs was similar between the treatment groups (8.5% [4/47] in placebo group vs 
7.4% [2/27] in casirivimab+imdevimab group). There were no deaths, SAEs, AESIs, or TEAEs resulting 
in study drug withdrawal among participants with undetermined baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. All TEAEs 
were mild or moderate in severity (grade <3). 
• 
Study HV-2093 
A greater proportion of participants experienced at least 1 TEAE during the entire study period in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg group (52.7%) than in the placebo group (46.3%). This imbalance 
was mainly due to the higher incidence of ISRs experienced by participants treated with 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg (34.7%) compared to placebo (15.5%). More participants in the 
placebo group experienced (12 (5%) a TEAE leading to study drug withdrawal than in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC group 9 (1.2%). 
 
Hospitalized Participants Study COV-2066   
• 
Study COV-2066 Cohort 1 (Phases 1 and 2) 
Only select TEAEs were required to be collected in this study (cohort 1, phase 1 only: all grade ≥3 
TEAEs; all cohorts, all phases: treatment-emergent SAEs, treatment-emergent grade ≥2 
hypersensitivity reactions and grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions). In cohort 1 (phases 1 and 2), which 
consisted of hospitalized participants on low flow oxygen, a higher percentage of participants in the 
placebo group experienced grade 3 and 4 TEAEs and SAEs, compared to the casirivimab+imdevimab 
 
Assessment report

Page 125/147
 
2400 mg and 8000 mg dose groups (Table 22). The percentage of participants who experienced TEAEs 
leading to death was similar across all treatment groups. 
Overall, the incidence of infusion-related reactions (grade ≥2) and hypersensitivity reactions (grade ≥2 
through day 29) was low in all treatment groups. A higher percentage of participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg dose group experienced an infusion-related reaction (grade ≥2) 
through day 4 than in the placebo group or in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg dose group. 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs leading to study withdrawal or leading to interruption of study drug 
infusion was low. Two participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group withdrew from study 
due to TEAEs (Infusion related reaction and Hypoxia, PTs), and 1 participant in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 8000 mg group experienced a TEAE (Anxiety, PT) leading to infusion 
interruption. 
 
• 
Study COV-2066 Cohort 2 (Phase 2) 
In COV-2066 cohort 2 (phase 2), which consisted of hospitalized patients on high-intensity oxygen 
therapy but not on mechanical ventilation, a greater percentage of patients receiving 
casirivimab+imdevimab than placebo experienced grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (30.9% vs. 23.5%), SAEs (50.9% 
vs. 39.2%), and TEAEs leading to death (39.1% vs. 25.5%). The IDMC recommended to pause further 
enrolment based on a potential safety signal and an unfavourable risk-benefit profile in cohorts 2 and 3 
at the time. A review of complete follow-up data by the sponsor for Cohort 2 show that these 
imbalances were related to advanced and progressive COVID-19 with associated concurrent medical 
conditions resulting in the events. Despite the imbalance between the combined casirivimab+imdevimab 
group compared to the placebo group for these events, there was no clear dose-dependence between 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg and 8000 mg treatment groups. No imbalance was observed in 
the recently published, independently conducted, study in hospitalized patients by Oxford University 
group (RECOVERY study).

The imbalance in grade 3 or grade 4 TEAEs was due to the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia in the 
placebo group. Most grade 3 and grade 4 events occurred in the first 29 days (109 events in 79 [3.0%] 
participants in the placebo group and 76 events in 56 [1.1%] participants in the combined 
casirivimab+imdevimab group. Six of these events (in 3 participants) were considered related to study 
treatment by the investigator, including urticaria and COVID-19 each in a unique 2400 mg participant 
and hyperhidrosis, nausea, vomiting and hyporesponsive to stimuli in one 8000 mg participant.  
An evaluation of SAEs reported by onset up to day 29 and from day 30 up to day 169 did not show any 
specific safety trends. The majority of SAEs (123/147 SAEs in the placebo group and 84/116 SAEs in 
the combined casirivimab+imdevimab group) were reported within first 29 days after treatment and 40 
participants (18 placebo and 22 casirivimab+imdevimab) experienced SAEs during the follow-up period 
after day 29. 
Two participants reported SAEs from day 1 to day 29 that were considered related to study treatment - 
COVID-19 in 1 participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group and Nausea, Vomiting, 
Hyporesponsive to stimuli and Hyperhidrosis in another participant in the 8000 mg group. No 
treatment-related SAEs were reported after day 29. 
There were 15 deaths reported as of the data cut; 11 in the placebo group, 1 in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg group and 3 in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg group). Most 
deaths (10 of 15) occurred prior to day 29. All TEAEs leading to death were considered not related to 
study treatment by the investigator and most were considered related to advanced and progressive 
COVID-19 disease or due to complications of participant-specific concurrent medical conditions. 
 
Study COV-20145 
Two participants (1 participant, each, in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg IV and 2400 mg IV 
groups) experienced an SAE. Both participants had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). Both events 
were not considered to be related to study treatment. 
There were no SAEs with SC administration of casirivimab+imdevimab.  
No SAEs with fatal outcome reported in participants in any dose groups or placebo. 
 
Study COV-2069 Cohort A 
As of the data cut-off date, 15/1306 (1.1%) participants in the placebo group and 10/1311 (0.8%) 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group experienced an SAE during the overall study period in 
cohort A (Table 69). With the exception of COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia, no other SAE was 
experienced by more than 1 participant in each treatment group. No participant in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group experienced a COVID-19-related SAE. 
Seven participants (4 [0.3%] in the placebo group and 3 [0.2%] in the casirivimab+imdevimab group) 
experienced SAEs during the EAP and 19 participants (12 [0.9%] in the placebo group and 7 [0.5%] in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab group) experienced SAEs during the follow-up period, of which 4 had a fatal 
outcome (see below). None of the SAEs were considered related to study treatment.

Adverse events of special interest 
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145) 
The incidence of AESIs was low in both studies; ≤2.5% of patients in any treatment group in COV-2067, 
and ≤1.8% of patients in any treatment group COV-20145 had AESIs.  
• 
Study COV-2067 
Throughout the study, treatment-emergent AESI (serious and non-serious), were defined as: 
• 
Grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions (IRRs), up to study day 4 
• 
Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions, up to study day 29 
Note: After protocol amendment 7, TEAEs that led to a MAV were also collected as AESIs to further 
inform MAV narratives, but such events are not described in this section as they are primarily captured 
in the Efficacy section. 
Three participants (0.1%) experienced a grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reaction in the placebo group 
compared to 2 participants (<0.1%) in the combined casirivimab+imdevimab treatment group. 
The incidence of grade ≥2 IRRs was numerically lower in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg group (1 
participant [<0.1%]) than in the 2400 mg group (4 participants [0.2%]) and 8000 mg group (7 
participants, 0.6%). No participant in the 1200 mg group discontinued study treatment or had study 
drug interruption due to grade ≥2 IRRs. 
• 
Study COV-20145 
Per protocol, treatment-emergent AESIs (serious and non-serious) were defined as: 
• 
Grade ≥2 infusion-related reactions up to study day 4 
• 
Grade ≥3 injection-site reactions up to study day 4 
• 
Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions up to study day 29 
• 
Any TEAE that led to a hospitalization or emergency room visit, regardless of whether the visit is 
related to COVID-19 
No patients experienced a grade ≥2 IRR, hypersensitivity reaction or grade ≥3 ISR.  
One participant in the placebo IV group (grade 1 mental confusion and grade 2 hallucinations), 1 
participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 600 mg IV group (grade 3 diverticulitis), and 2 participants in 
the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg IV group (grade 3 COVID-19 [worsening diarrhoea] and grade 1 
COVID-19 [shortness of breath]) had TEAEs that led to hospitalization or emergency room visits, of 
which 2 were considered to be related to underlying COVID-19 symptoms and the other 2 were related 
to the participant’s medical history. None of the events were considered related to study treatment  
One participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC arm had an AESI of grade 2 Deep vein 
thrombosis, which was not considered to be related to study treatment by the investigator but related 
to COVID-19.

Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093) 
• 
Study COV-2069 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in this study included ISRs or hypersensitivity reactions with 
a severity of grade 3 or higher. As of the data cut-off date, there were no AESIs meeting the pre-
specified criteria in either cohort. 
• 
Study HV-2093 
For this study, AESIs were defined as grade 3 or greater ISRs or hypersensitivity reactions including but 
not limited to anaphylaxis, laryngeal/pharyngeal oedema, severe bronchospasm, chest pain, seizure, or 
severe hypotension. As of the data cut-off for this report, AESIs were neither reported in the placebo 
group nor in the active treatment group. 
Laboratory findings 
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145) 
In general, no clinically meaningful trends in mean or median change from baseline to day 29 were 
observed in laboratory parameters or the incidence was low.    
Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093) 
There were no observable trends over time or notable differences between the treatment groups in 
mean or median change from baseline at day 8 or at any other planned collection timepoint through the 
end of the treatment period or over the entire period for any haematology parameter or chemistry 
parameter in either of the studies 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly Participants (Age ≥65 Years) 
• 
Study COV-2067 
A greater percentage of participants in the ≥65 years of age subgroup compared to the 18 to <65 years 
of age subgroup experienced at least 1 treatment emergent SAE from day 1 to the last available data. 
More participants in the ≥65 years of age subgroup experienced treatment-emergent SAEs in the 
infections and infestations and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders SOCs compared to the 18 
to <65 years of age subgroup.  
The number of participants in each age subgroup who experienced grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions 
was very low (<0.5%).  
• 
Study HV-2093 (all TEAEs) 
Compared to the overall population, a smaller proportion of participants who were ≥65 years old 
(n=126) experienced a TEAE during the treatment period, with a greater frequency of at least 1 TEAE 
reported in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg treatment group (38.9%) than in the placebo group 
(30.6%). The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥5%) were ISRs (16.7% in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
1200 mg group versus 11.1% in the placebo group) and headache (6.7% in the casirivimab+imdevimab 
1200 mg group versus 2.8% in the placebo group).  
In the small subset of participants who were ≥75 years old (n=16), TEAEs occurred in 9.1% of 
participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 20.0% in the placebo group.

Paediatric patients 
Study COV-2069 cohort A and B enrolled adolescents (≥12 to<18 years). No adolescent participant 
(age ≥12 to ≤18 years) reported grade 3 or grade 4 TEAEs during the overall study period 
No data are available in paediatric patients aged <12 years. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are limited data on pregnancies occurring in patients administered casirivimab+imdevimab. 
Across the studies that allowed enrolment of pregnant women (Study COV-2067, Study COV-2069 and 
StudyCOV-20145), a total of 10 patients were either pregnant at study entry or became pregnant 
during the study at the time of the data cut-off dates (of which 6 received casirivimab+imdevimab and 
4 received placebo). A further 3 patients reported pregnancies under the EUA or compassionate use 
program. Of these 13 patients, 5 had early termination of the pregnancy (1 voluntary termination, 3 
SAEs of spontaneous abortion and 1 SAE of ruptured ectopic pregnancy). The 4 SAEs were reported in 
patients receiving casirivimab+imdevimab; none of the SAEs were considered related to study drug. Of 
the remaining patients with available follow-up information, 4 had either delivered babies without 
complication or had ongoing pregnancies with no concerns or irregularities reported at the time of last 
contact.  
Two events of exposure to casirivimab+imdevimab during pregnancy were reported under the EUA and 
1 event of similar exposure during pregnancy was reported in the CU program. No outcome data was 
available for the patients in the EUA program while the patient in the CU program gave birth without 
complications. 
 
Immunological events 
Injection Site Reactions 
• 
Study COV-2069 Cohort A 
Few (<5%) participants in cohort A reported ISRs during the efficacy assessment period, all were grade 
2 or below, and the majority were mild in severity. The 2 most frequently reported signs or symptoms 
of ISR were erythema (0.5% and 2.1% of participants in the placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab 
group, respectively) and pruritis (0.4% and 1.2% of participants in the placebo and 
casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively.  
• 
Study COV-2069 Cohort B 
A few (<5%) participants in cohort B reported ISRs during the efficacy assessment period. All ISRs 
experienced by participants in cohort B were grade 2 or below and all were mild in severity. The 2 most 
frequently reported signs or symptoms of ISR were erythema (0.6% and 1.3% of participants in the 
placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively) and ecchymosis (0% and 1.3% of participants 
in the placebo and casirivimab+imdevimab group, respectively.  
• 
Study HV-2093 
There were no grade 3 or greater ISRs reported in this repeat dose study. More participants in the 
casirivimab+imdevimab group (253/729 participants; 34.7%) reported symptoms of ISRs compared to 
the placebo group (38/240 participants; 15.8%) during the treatment period. The 2 most common 
symptoms of the ISRs were erythema and pruritus in the casirivimab+imdevimab group (26.6% and 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 133/147
 
12.5% of participants, respectively), and erythema and ecchymosis in the placebo group (both 
experienced by 5.8% of participants). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
 
As a monoclonal antibody, casirivimab+imdevimab is not anticipated to interact with cytochrome P450 
(CYP) or drug transporters, and drug-drug interactions between casirivimab+imdevimab and other 
drugs is not anticipated. 
Casirivimab+imdevimab binds to epitopes on spike protein used as immunogen in all COVID-19 
vaccines; therefore, it may be possible that casirivimab+imdevimab could interfere with the 
development of effective immune responses to COVID 19 vaccines. 
• 
Study HV-2093 
At the time of the data cut for this study, 97 (10%) of participants had received a COVID-19 
vaccination, of which 67 were in the 1200 mg casirivimab+imdevimab SC group. Vaccine administration 
was frequently in close temporal proximity to casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 mg SC administration, with 
a median of 18 days from last dose of casirivimab+imdevimab to vaccination (i.e., approximately the 
middle of the dosing interval). Thus, participants received vaccines at a time when 
casirivimab+imdevimab serum levels are expected to be in the therapeutic range. 
Only 1 of 67 (1.5%) participants in the casirivimab+imdevimab group and 3 of 30 (10.0%) participants 
in the placebo group experienced TEAEs after vaccination. The participant who received 
casirivimab+imdevimab and was later vaccinated experienced a TEAE after vaccination of urinary tract 
infection (PT), which was considered not related to study drug by the investigator.  
Overall, there were low numbers of TEAEs reported and no patterns could be identified. Of note, at the 
time of the finalization of this document, results from the analyses of immune response to COVID-19 
vaccination were not available. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Outpatients (Study COV-2067 and Study COV-20145) 
In Study COV-2067 seven participants discontinued from the study due to TEAEs (3 placebo, 1 in the 
1200 mg group, 2 in the 2400 mg group and 1 in the 8000 mg group). Six of the 7 discontinuations 
occurred through day 29 and most were due to COVID-19 or associated complications. Seven 
participants experienced TEAEs leading to study infusion discontinuation - 1 in the placebo group and 6 
in the combined casirivimab+imdevimab groups. The TEAEs (PTs) of Presyncope (in 1 placebo 
participant), Nausea (in 1 1200 mg participant), Infusion-related reactions, Rash (in one 8000 mg 
participant) and Chills (in one 8000 mg participant) were considered related to study treatment and the 
TEAE of Abdominal pain (in one 8000 mg participant) was considered not related. 
In Study COV-20145 one participant in the casirivimab+imdevimab 2400 mg IV group discontinued 
study treatment (i.e., did not receive full infusion) due to a TEAE (Infusion related reaction). Study drug 
was withdrawn as a result of this event. The TEAE was considered to be related to study treatment by 
the investigator and resolved the same day. 
Prevention (Study COV-2069 and Study HV-2093) 
As of the data cut-off date, no participant experienced a TEAE that led to study treatment 
discontinuation in any of these studies.  
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 134/147
 
• 
Study HV-2093 
As a result of AEs, a total of 19 participants (5.7%) withdrew from study treatment: 8 (1.1%) in the 
active treatment group and 11 (4.6%) in the placebo group.  
Infection with COVID-19 accounted for 10 of the 11 discontinuations in the placebo group, and 1 
participant discontinued due to the non-COVID-19 TEAEs of blood sodium decreased, anaemia, and fluid 
retention. 
Infection with COVID-19 accounted for 2 of the 8 discontinuations in the casirivimab+imdevimab 1200 
mg group. The other 6 participants discontinued from the active treatment group due to the non-
COVID-19 TEAEs of alopecia, urticaria, angina pectoris, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, major 
depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  
All TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were assessed as not related to study drug, with the 
exception of a single case of grade 1 pruritis (itching) occurring in a 50-59 year old participant in the 
active treatment group, for which this event occurred on study day 35, 6 days after the last dose of 
study drug. 
 
Post marketing experience 
Since 21 Nov 2020, 363 cases have reported 1,153 AEs, including 68 cases (with 168 events) reporting 
a medication error and 238 cases (714 events) reporting an SAE. The remaining cases were non-serious 
events that were reported outside the required SAEs and medication errors. 
The most frequently reported SAEs at the PT level, defined as occurring in ≥10 patients, were COVID-19 
pneumonia, dizziness, cough, dyspnoea, hypotension, hypoxia, nausea, chills, chest pain, pyrexia, 
vomiting, fatigue, and oxygen saturation decreased. 
A total of 5 cases (5 events) of anaphylaxis have been reported.  
A total of 8 fatal cases were reported with10 events (pulmonary embolism, oxygen saturation 
decreased, dyspnoea, acute respiratory failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, dyspnoea on 
exertion, death [3 events]); all cases were considered unrelated to study drug 
These events are consistent with IRRs or symptoms of COVID-19 and are similar to AEs observed in the 
clinical trials 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
 
No integrated analysis of safety data across the studies was performed due to differences in the study 
populations, dose regimens, and routes of administration and sample sizes. 
In studies COV-20145, COV-2069 and HV-2093 all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were collected. 
However only select TEAE categories were required to be collected in COV-2067 and COV-2066. In both 
studies more fragile patients are enrolled either patients with risk factors for developing COVID-19 
disease (Study COV-2067) or diseased patients in different stages of the disease. The reasons to restrict 
the collection to selected TEAEs is understandable. However, the safety profile in the fragile population 
cannot be fully established. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 135/147
 
The safety evaluation is based on 7671 participants who received casirivimab+imdevimab either IV or 
SC in the randomized clinical studies contributing safety data to this application (Table 10). Of these 
participants: 
• 
5248 received a single dose casirivimab+imdevimab IV 
• 
1694 received a single dose casirivimab+imdevimab SC 
• 
729 received repeated administration of casirivimab+imdevimab SC Q4W x 6 doses. 
With exception of the study in hospitalised patients (Study COV-2066 Cohort 2 (Phase 2)), the incidence 
of SAEs and AESIs was low, no dose-dependent pattern of AEs was observed, and no specific safety 
signal was identified in either study. Number of deaths was low. There were 7 death reported during the 
study period, none of the deaths were considered related to study drug but were all considered related 
to advanced and progressive COVID-19 disease. Five additional fatalities occurred in the follow up 
period, the event was assessed to be not related to study drug. 
In COV-2066 Cohort 2 (Phase 2), which consisted of hospitalized patients on high-intensity oxygen 
therapy but not on mechanical ventilation, a greater percentage of patients receiving 
casirivimab+imdevimab than placebo experienced grade 3 or 4 TEAEs The IDMC recommended to pause 
further enrolment based on a potential safety signal and an unfavourable risk-benefit profile in cohorts 
2 and 3 at the time. A review of complete follow-up data by the sponsor for Cohort 2 show that these 
imbalances were related to advanced and progressive COVID-19 with associated concurrent medical 
conditions resulting in the events. However, no imbalance was observed in the recently published, 
Recovery study conducted independently in a similar population. 
In general, no clinically meaningful trends in mean or median change from baseline to day 29 were 
observed in laboratory parameters or the incidence was low.    
There were no notable differences in the safety profile of casirivimab+imdevimab, including the 
occurrence of IRRs, in patients aged ≥65 years compared to aged ≥18 to 65 years. The findings 
observed in the elderly population are consistent with increased age being a known risk factor for 
developing more serious complications of COVID-19 disease.  
Overall, the number of adolescents enrolled was relatively small, which limits the comparison with 
adults; however, no AEs reported in the adolescent population suggested a safety concern for 
casirivimab+imdevimab.   
Among these participants who were vaccinated during the study period, there were no grade ≥3 TEAE, 
SAE or AESIs in the casirivimab+imdevimab groups following the vaccinations. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Study COV-2069 cohort A and B enrolled adolescents ≥12 to<18 years). No adolescent participant (age 
≥12 to ≤18 years) reported grade 3 or grade 4 TEAEs during the overall study period 
No data are available in paediatric patients aged <12 years. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of Ronapreve appears manageable and in line with what is expected from a 
monoclonal antibody targeting a viral protein and with no intrinsic effector function.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 107.2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that casirivimab and imdevimab has not been previously authorised in a 
medicinal product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers casirivimab and imdevimab to be  new active 
substances as they are not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
Due to time constraints from the accelerated development of the clinical programme and the submission 
of the Marketing Authorisation Application and the applicant submitted the results of pilot user 
consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant which showed 
that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
This was accepted but the CHMP requested that the results of a full user consultation with target patient 
groups on the package leaflet should be submitted once available.

2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The Group agreed to the use of minimum particulars for the 20ml vial due to the limited space available 
on the label and the need to reflect the critical, for the safe and effective use of the product, information 
in a readable way. Moreover, the product is to be used by HCPs only. 
As regards to the legal status, the CHMP endorsed a medical prescription status in the context of the 
pandemic situation to allow appropriate flexibility for the access and administration of the medicinal 
product under the appropriate monitoring recommendations provided in the product information. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ronapreve (casirivimab / imdevimab) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The novel SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified during an outbreak of atypical viral pneumonia cases of 
unknown aetiology in China in December 2019.  Subsequently this has emerged as the cause of the 
global Covid-19 pandemic 
The majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit relatively mild symptoms or are 
asymptomatic (Hu, 2020) (Oran, 2020), suggesting that most cases can be managed in an outpatient 
setting. However, a subset of infections leads to hypoxemia and other serious respiratory conditions 
that require hospitalization or can be fatal (Guan, 2020) (Richardson, 2020) (Wu, 2020). Infection is 
more likely to lead to hospitalization among patients with pre-existing risk factors or comorbidities, such 
as older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or chronic lung disease (CDC, 2021) 
(Lighter, 2020). Such risk factors also include the likelihood of death following hospitalization (Wu, 
2020). There is also a subset of patients, approximately 10% to 35%, who recover from the acute 
SARS-CoV-2 infection but experience persistent symptoms, which occur beyond 4 weeks from the initial 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis (Greenhalgh, 2020) (Tenforde, 
2020). 
Casirivimab and imdevimab are neutralizing antibodies that block the interaction between the 
transmembrane S protein and its canonical host receptor angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).  
The proposed indications are:  
• 
for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing 
at least 40 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of 
progressing to severe COVID-19. 
• 
for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older and weighing 
at least 40 kg. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Remdesivir is approved in the EU to treat COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (≥12 years old and 
weighing ≥40 kg) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen. No other treatments, including for 
the treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients, are currently approved in the EU.  
Vaccination is the mainstay of prevention of COVID-19, but considering the time frame required to 
develop immunity, there remains an unmet need for acute prevention in persons who have been 
exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there are patient populations for whom vaccination will not be 
effective or is highly unlikely to be effective in preventing COVID-19, i.e., those with altered 
immunocompetence such as due to primary or secondary immunodeficiencies. For these patients that 
require chronic prevention, there are currently no endorsed or approved non-vaccine options.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.1.3.1.  Treatment Studies 
Study R10933-10987-COV-2067 (referred to as COV-2067) was the pivotal treatment study aimed to 
demonstrate clinical and virologic efficacy in high risk outpatients with COVID-19 not on supplemental 
oxygen. COV-2067 is an adaptive phase 1/2/3 study in outpatients with COVID-19. Clinical and virologic 
efficacy data from the phase 3 portion of this study provide the primary demonstration of efficacy for 
casirivimab+imdevimab in the treatment of these patients to markedly decrease viral load and reduce 
the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death; the clinical and virologic efficacy data from the 
phase 1 and 2 portion of this study provide supportive data for the demonstration of efficacy. 
3.1.3.2.  Prevention 
R10933-10987-COV-2069 (referred to as COV-2069) was the pivotal phase 3 prevention study to 
evaluate efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 
in those living with a known SARS-CoV-2-infected person. Two study populations were analysed 
separately: cohort A (referred to as COV-2069A) consisted of asymptomatic participants uninfected at 
baseline and cohort B (referred to as COV-2069B) consisted of asymptomatic participants who were 
infected at baseline. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
3.2.1.  Treatment 
In study COV-2067 there was a reduction in the proportion of the mFAS population (RT-PCR positive 
with at least one protocol-listed risk factor) progressing to hospitalisation for COVID-19 or dying from 
any cause in patients treated with Ronapreve compared to the placebo group.  There was a statistically 
significant treatment effect for each of 1200 mg and 2400 mg vs. placebo in the seronegative mFAS. 
The risk reduction was similar between the two doses, 72.5% for the 1200mg dose (11 cases Vs 40 for 
the placebo group) and 70.9% for the 2400 mg dose (23 case Vs 78 for the placebo group). 
 
There was a statistically significant treatment effect for both the 1200 and the 2400 mg vs. their 
respective placebo groups in the seropositive subset. Ronapreve 1200 mg and 2400 mg both shortened 
the median time to symptom resolution by 3 day (median 10 days vs. 13 days for placebo). 
3.2.2.  Prevention 
In Study 2069, in Cohort A (RT-PCR negative at baseline for SARS-CoV-2 infection), there was a 
statistically significant 81% relative risk reduction (from 7.8% to 1.5%) for development of 
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. A 31% reduction of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was seen in 
Cohort-B (RT-PCR positive at baseline) for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same study for patients treated 
with Ronapreve (29%) compared to placebo (42.3%). 
There was a nominally significant effect in the overall population, comprising all randomised subjects. 
Results indicate that treatment with casirivimab+imdevimab reduced the risk of progression to 
symptomatic RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by 65.0% compared to placebo, from 9.1% 
(150/1657) to 3.2% (52/1641), nominal p<0.0001, suggesting that PCR testing may not be required to 
guide the decision to initiate prophylaxis. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 141/147
 
Treatment reduced the viral load, the duration of symptomatic infection and the duration of viral 
shedding and no subject who developed COVID-19 despite having Ronapreve required hospitalisation or 
ER visits vs. 4 cases in the placebo group in Cohort and 6 cases in Cohort B. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The primary endpoint in study 2067 of hospitalization for COVID-19 or all-case death is a composite 
endpoint, however results are driven by the incidence of hospitalization with only 5 deaths (3 in placebo 
treated patients) recorded up to day 29.Therefore the data currently do not allow any conclusion on an 
effect of treatment (neither positive nor negative) on the occurrence of death. 
Study 2067 was also subject to numerous and late amendments, including changes to the primary 
endpoint and analysis. Some of these changes, including the definition of the interim analysis are post-
hoc (data cut-off date: 18 Feb 2021, date of Amendment 8: 12 March 2021). 
The effect of treatment seems to be substantially smaller in patients without documented risk factors, 
but currently it cannot be concluded whether specific risk factors are predictive of the effect of 
treatment. 
Treatment using the SC route of administration was not studied in the pivotal trial and in the absence of 
convincing dose-response and exposure-response data, the extrapolation of efficacy from the 1200 mg 
IV dose to the proposed alternative 1200 mg SC dose in the treatment setting based on PK bridging is 
not accepted. It is therefore recommended that the subcutaneous route of administration is used only if 
intravenous administration is not feasible and would lead to a delay in treatment. 
In study 2069, local testing for SARS-CoV-2 was utilized for screening based on assays available at the 
sites according to their local procedures. Patients were enrolled and stratified based on the positive 
result from a local sample because it was considered inappropriate to delay treatment for 2-3 days 
awaiting central lab RT-qPCR results that were obtained in all patients from nasopharyngeal samples 
acquired according to standardized instructions at baseline. However, as randomisation was stratified by 
local laboratory test and the distinction between cohort A or B was done based on a central laboratory 
test there is a portion of subjects who were assigned to cohort B although they were randomized in a 
different stratum (similar for cohort A). 
Efficacy in the prevention study is not demonstrated under strong control of type-I-error, as this was 
controlled for each cohort (A and B) separately. The concept of two independent studies in cohorts A 
and B is not fully agreed and consequently there is uncertainty on the interpretation of statistical 
significance. While results in cohort A (subjects tested negative for SARS-CoV-2) are persuasive despite 
this uncertainty, cohort B results were considered somewhat uncertain. Results in strata of 
randomisation suggest that cohort B results may not have been statistically significant if investigated in 
an independent study (p=0.23). However, post-hoc analyses indicate that prophylaxis is beneficial in 
the overall population (relative risk reduction of 65.0%, nominal p<0.0001 in pooled cohorts A, B and 
subjects with undetermined PCR test). Observed results in positive and undetermined subjects therefore 
provide support that a negative PCR test should not be required before treatment. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
With exception of the study in hospitalised patients (Study COV-2066 Cohort 2 (Phase 2)), the incidence 
of SAEs and AESIS was low, no dose-dependent pattern of AEs was observed, and no specific safety 
signal was identified in either of the pivotal studies. A small number of infusion related reactions 
following IV administration were observed and adequate wording is included in the SmPC to manage 
these. 
 
Assessment report  
EMA/680189/2021 
Page 142/147
 
The number of deaths was low. None of the deaths were considered related to study drug but related to 
advanced and progressive COVID-19 disease.  
There were no notable differences in the safety profile of casirivimab+imdevimab, including the 
occurrence of IRRs, in patients aged ≥65 years compared to aged ≥18 to 65 years. The findings 
observed in the elderly population are consistent with increased age being a known risk factor for 
developing more serious complications of COVID-19 disease.  
Among these participants who were vaccinated during the study period, there were no grade ≥3 TEAE, 
SAE or AESIs in the casirivimab+imdevimab groups following the vaccinations. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Select TEAE categories were required to be collected in COV-2067 and COV-2066. In both studies more 
fragile patients are enrolled either patients with risk factors for developing COVID-19 disease (Study 
COV-2067) or diseased patients in different stages of the disease. Whilst the reasons to restrict the 
collection to selected TEAEs is understandable it is possible that the safety characterisation in those 
studies may be incomplete  
The number of adolescents enrolled was relatively small, which limits the comparison with adults; 
however, no AEs reported in the adolescent population suggested a safety concern for 
casirivimab+imdevimab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A reduction of COVID-19-related hospitalisation or all-cause death in symptomatic patients who do not 
require supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-
19 was demonstrated under treatment with Ronapreve. The duration of symptomatic disease was reduced 
in patients receiving Ronapreve.  
In the prophylactic setting progression to symptomatic disease was reduced in either uninfected or infected 
household contacts.  
In uninfected subjects, the overall risk of infection as reduced. In infected subjects, the duration of 
symptoms was shortened.  
Uninfected subjects had a reduction of the risk of developing a high viral load infection; while in infected 
subjects the duration of high viral load infection was reduced.  
The effects are considered clinically meaningful and were consistent across all doses and routes of 
administration used.  
The safety profile of Ronapreve and potential risks associated with its use can be adequately managed by 
labelling in the product information. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of treatment with Ronapreve as demonstrated in two pivotal trials conducted for the treatment 
and prophylaxis of COVID-19 outweigh the risks which were observed in those clinical trials.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ronapreve is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section ‘Recommendations’.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Ronapreve is favourable in the following indications: 
-  Treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg 
who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe 
COVID-19. 
-  Prevention of COVID-19 in adult patients and in adolescent patients aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg.

• 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that casirivimab and imdevimab are  
new active substances as they are not constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plans P/0347/2021 and P/0348/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the
