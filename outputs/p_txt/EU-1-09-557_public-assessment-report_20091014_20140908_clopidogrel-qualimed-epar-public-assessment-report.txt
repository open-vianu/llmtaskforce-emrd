Active Substance 
 
Clopidogrel hydrochloride is a white to off-white or yellowish crystalline powder practically insoluble 
 water at neutral pH but freely soluble at pH = 1. It is also freely dissolves in methanol. Clopidogrel 
in
hydrochloride has the chemical name (+)-(S)-Methyl α-(o-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c] 
pyridine-5(4H)-acetate hydrochloride. It does not show polymorphism. The active substance has one 
chiral centre therefore it exhibits chirality – clopidogrel hydrochloride is synthesized as the S-
enantiomer.

the results of two new non-clinical studies (acute and chronic toxicity) conducted with clopidogrel 
hydrochloride were provided. Furthermore, on the basis of the CHMP Guidance for users of the 
centralised procedure for generic application (EMEA/CHMP/225411/2006), when different salts of 
the active substance of the reference medicinal product are used, additional information providing 
proof that their non-clinical safety and/or efficacy profile is not different from that of the reference 
medicinal product is needed. Thus, information that the different clopidogrel salt (clopidogrel 
hydrochloride) does not differ significantly in non-clinical properties with regards to safety and 
efficacy of the reference product were requested by the CHMP in accordance with the relevant 
guideline.  
 
The response referred to the results of the toxicity and genotoxicity studies to examine the safety

Toxicology). The 13-week toxicity study report did not detect major differences in the same safety 
profile for the hydrochloride and hydrogen sulphate salt; liver was determined as the target organ in 
both salts. Regarding the genotoxicity testing, clopidogrel hydrochloride tested at a higher 
concentration level than clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate, turned to be not clastogenic in the 
chromosome aberration test. In the micronucleus test, at the same dose levels, neither the hydrogen 
sulphate salt nor the hydrochloride salt was found clastogenic/aneugenic. Thus, based on the data 
provided, similar safety profile was demonstrated for clopidogrel hydrochloride and clopidogrel 
hydrogen sulphate.

Repeated-dose toxicity 
The toxicity of clopidogrel hydrochloride was investigated in rats u

10 females each versus 
body weight/day. Treatment with clopidogrel hydrochloride was generally well tolerated, based on the 
lack of treatment related clinical signs and the normal growth of the animals. Some treatment related 
changes in haematology, e.g. thrombocytes, and clinical chemistry, e.g. cholesterol, triglycerides, 
bilirubin, total protein, etc., were revealed. Decreased thymus weights, increased adrenal, kidney, 
seminal vesicles and liver weights and hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes were also observed. 
The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for clopidogrel hydrochloride was considered 12.5 
mg/kg body weight/day. There appears to be no additional toxic effects of clopidogrel hydrochloride 
although no direct comparative data between the clopidogrel hydrochloride and clopidogrel 
hydrogensulphate were provided. Furthermore, any potential differences in the non-clinical 
toxicokinetic profile would be apparent in the clinical pharmacokinetic profile addressed by the 
bioequivalence studies. 
 
Genotoxicity 
The in vitro Salmonell

chromosome 
also negative. The eventual mutagenic activity of clopidogrel hydrochloride was investigated in the 
bacterial reverse mutation assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA 1535 
and TA102, without and with metabolic activation. The tested substance was considered non 
mutagenic. Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in micronucleus test in mice. Incidence of micronucleated 
polychromatic red blood cells (RBs) was not elevated in mice received clopidogrel at oral doses up to 
2000 mg/kg daily, for three consecutive days. Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic RBCs was 
also normal which indicates that there was no bone marrow cytotoxicity. There was no evidence of 
any clastogenic activity for clopidogrel. 
 
Although the in vitro studies did not reveal any mutagenic, genotoxic or clastogenic potential of 
clopidogrel, the CHMP raised a major ob

response, adequately conducted reverse mutation assays in accordance with GLP standards and OECD 
guideline protocol number 471 was provided. The results of the Ames test performed with potassium 
ethyl sulphate and clopidogrel isopropyl sulphate indicated that these two substances do not hold a

validation and validation of the bio-analytical technique used for determination of clopidogrel, and the 
CHMP questioned the validity of the bioequivalence study. Thus, a GCP inspection was requested.

Risk Management Plan 
 
Risk Management Plan has not been submitted. Since the application concerns generics of respective 
reference medicinal products for which no safety concerns requiring additional risk minimization 
activities have been identified, this considered acceptable. 
 
Discussion on Clinical aspects 
 
One clinical bioequivalence trial 07-197 was provided for Clopidogrel Qualimed application, 
analysing the parent prodrug clopidogrel. The demonstration of the unchanged safety/efficacy profile 
of clopidogrel hydrochloride when compared with Plavix (clopidogrel hydrogensulphate) was raised 
by the CHMP as a major issue for this generic product. In response, further discussion on the 
comparability of the efficacy and safety profiles of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and clopidogrel 
hydrochloride was provided. Pharmacokinetics, dissolution, adverse events profile and other clinical 
data were considered and it was concluded that the two salts of clopidogrel have a comparable 
safety/efficacy profile. 
 
At the time of approval of the reference product Plavix, there was no reliable and validated 
methodology for the determination of the pharmacokinetics of the parent prodrug clopidogrel, or of 
the active metabolite clopidogrel thiol. Thus, the pharmacokinetic profile was established based on the 
pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid, which is the non-active metabolite.  In the meantime, 
a reliable bioanalytical method for determination of clopidogrel in plasma and urine was developed. 
Since the pharmacokinetic profile of the active metabolite is still not well established, the CHMP 
accepted the proof of bioequivalence based on the clopidogrel parent compound data in study 07-197.

Thus, data related to pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considered supportive, 
whereas data on clopidogrel parent drug is important for the confirmation of bioequivalence. 
 
The indication of Clopidogrel Qualimed is different from that of the reference medicinal product, 
Plavix (please see section 2.1). Thus, the Product Information has been adequately amended to reflect 
this change and this is considered acceptable.  
 
Furthermore, the recently published literature data indicate that the bioavailability of a single oral dose 
of clopidogrel and the pharmacokinetic parameters of clopidogrel, especially Cmax and AUCinf, might 
be increased by several folds in the fed condition compared to the fasted condition. The currently 
presented clinical studies were conducted in fasted state and thus, the CHMP requested a clarification 
of this approach and adequate justification why bioequivalence for the generic product should be 
demonstrated only under fasting condition was provided. Bioequivalence studies in fasting conditions 
are normally recommended as mentioned in the Questions & Answers on the Bioavailability and 
Bioequivalence Guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006) document as the drug product is to be 
administered under fasting as well as fed conditions. In addition to the dissolution studies using 
clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate, conducted at three different pH values (1.2, 4.5, 6.8), the applicant 
provided an additional in vivo bioequivalence study conducted under fed conditions. The comparative 
in vitro dissolution studies under conditions mimicking the fed state as well the fed state 
bioequivalence study did not reveal any major differences when compared to the reference drug 
product. 
 
The bio-analytical technique and methodology applied in the analysis of the samples during the 
bioequivalence studies included validation with the analysis of calibration curves and controls at 
various concentrations. The CHMP questioned whether there is a potential for back-conversion of the 
quantitatively major metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid to the parent drug. Considering that the 
plasma levels of clopidogrel carboxylic acid are considerably higher than those of the parent drug, a 
minimum back-conversion of the metabolite would lead to a significant over-estimation of clopidogrel 
plasma levels and would bias the outcome of the bioequivalence study. The back-conversion could 
occur in the presence of alcohol used in sample preparation and analysis. It was, indeed, reported that 
a possible back-conversion of clopidogrel metabolite to clopidogrel parent drug was evidenced in the 
presence of methanol. In order to avoid this process, the extraction procedure was changed and 
methanol-free conditions employed. Although it has been indicated that stability tests were performed 
in order to prove the reproducibility and accuracy of clopidogrel concentration measurements, the 
CHMP questioned these results since no clear description of the analytical technique including 
extraction procedure actually used in the initial pre-study validation process was provided. 
Information on the validation procedures in study 07-197 was requested by the CHMP. In response, 
details of the bio-analytical methodology and full validation details were provided demonstrating that 
no methanol, which is needed for the conversion the acid metabolite to clopidogrel, was used and thus, 
no source of methylation exists within the entire methodology, including all solution preparation, 
plasma sample processing, handling storage and LC-MS/MS determination. The CHMP considered 
this issue resolved. 
 
Considering the above difficulties in the determination of clopidogrel in plasma especially the issue 
related to the possible back-conversion of the metabolite to the parent drug, a triggered GCP 
inspection of the bioequivalence study was requested by the CHMP, which was of the opinion that 
results of this inspection and the satisfactory responses to its findings were an integral part of the 
evaluation procedure. The inspection identified major and minor findings that seem not to affect the 
overall results of the trial.  
 
The bioequivalence study 07-197 and its statistical evaluation were in accordance with accepted 
standards for bioequivalence testing, as stated in the Note for Guidance on the Investigation of 
Bioavailability and Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). The parameters used to establish 
bioavailability included the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the maximal plasma 
concentration of the parent compound of clopidogrel. The 90% confidence intervals for these 
parameters were within the recommended 80-125% range for clopidogrel, required by the above 
mentioned guideline. The proposed widening of the 90% confidence interval for clopidogrel Cmax to

75%-133% was found to be unacceptable by the CHMP; nevertheless, since the confidence intervals 
for Cmax values of clopidogrel were within the required 80-125% range, the need for widening of the 
intervals was not applicable. The bioequivalence with Plavix was proven.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
 
The application contains adequate quality, non clinical and clinical data and the bioequivalence has 
been shown. A benefit/Risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
 
Recommendation 
 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio of Clopidogrel Qualimed in the prevention of atherothrombotic events in: 
• 
Patients suffering from myocardial infarction (from a few days until less than 35 days), 
ischaemic stroke (from 7 days until less than 6 months) or established peripheral arterial 
disease. 
 
was favourable  and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.
