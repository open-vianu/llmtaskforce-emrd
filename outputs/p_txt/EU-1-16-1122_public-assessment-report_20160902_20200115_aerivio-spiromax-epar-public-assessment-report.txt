2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Aerivio Spiromax (FS Spiromax) is an orally inhaled fixed-dose combination product containing the 
active substances fluticasone propionate, an inhaled glucocorticosteroid (ICS) with anti-inflammatory 
activity in the lungs and salmeterol xinafoate, a selective long-acting inhaled ß2 adrenoceptor agonist 
(LABA).  This combination of active substances is already approved at national level in several EU 
countries for use in the regular treatment of adults, adolescents and children with asthma where the 
use of the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an inhaled long-acting ß2 adrenoceptor agonist 
is deemed appropriate and in the symptomatic treatment of adults with severe chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Fluticasone propionate is an orally inhaled glucocorticosteroid with high local anti-inflammatory activity 
and a lower incidence of adverse effects than is seen with oral corticosteroids.  Fluticasone propionate 
has been shown to reduce symptoms and exacerbations of asthma and to decrease airway reactivity to 
histamine and methacholine in patients with hyper reactive airways. Fluticasone propionate is a well-
established active substance and is recommended for use in the management of asthma in both adults 
and children.   
Salmeterol xinafoate is a selective long-acting β2 adrenergic agonist and exerts a preferential effect on 
β2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to produce relaxation and bronchodilatation.  
Salmeterol is used via the orally inhaled route in the management of patients with reversible airway 
obstruction.  Inhalation of salmeterol produces bronchodilatation, which lasts for 12 hours following a 
single dose.  Salmeterol is particularly useful in patients with reversible airway obstruction who 
continue to experience symptoms despite treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an 
inhaled corticosteroid. Guidelines for the management of reversible airway obstruction and particularly 
asthma recommend the addition of a long-acting β2 agonist to the treatment regimen in these patients 
and studies have shown that the addition of a long-acting β2 agonist provides better control of asthma 
than increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. 
The mechanisms of action of the two drugs, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate, are 
different but complementary.  Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate demonstrate additive 
effects. 
Asthma 
The goal of pharmacologic therapy in asthma is to control chronic and nocturnal symptoms, maintain 
normal activity levels (including exercise), maintain near-normal pulmonary function, prevent acute 
episodes of asthma, minimize emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and avoid adverse effects of 
asthma medications (GINA 2015, NAEPP 2007). 
Quick-relief medications, such as short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergics are used 
to treat acute symptoms by rapidly reversing airflow limitation and bronchoconstriction. Long-term 
control medications such as ICS, immunomodulators, and LABAs are used to help achieve daily control 
of persistent asthma symptoms. 
The ICS are the most effective anti-inflammatory treatment for persistent asthma; they reduce asthma 
symptoms and airway hyper-responsiveness, improve lung function and reduce exacerbations 
(Hodgson et al 2010). When symptoms persist despite low-dose ICS (Step 2 Global Initiative for 
Asthma [GINA]), the addition of a LABA is the most effective next step (GINA 2015). Combination

therapy involving the use of an ICS and a LABA provides a therapeutic benefit to patients with 
inadequate asthma control on ICS alone and is the recommended therapeutic option for patients over 
4 years of age who have inadequate asthma control on low to medium-dose ICS in addition to as-
needed use of short-acting beta2-agonist bronchodilators (GINA 2015). 
The fixed combination of salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate has been shown to provide 
greater improvement in pulmonary function and overall asthma control than either individual 
compound alone. In addition, its use does not result in any untoward interaction that affects the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) or pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the individual drugs or their safety profiles 
(Spencer and Jarvis 1999). The use of such a combination is in accordance with current guidelines for 
the management of asthma. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
Fixed-dose combinations of ICS and LABA licensed for use in COPD in the EU include twice-daily 
salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate and budesonide/formoterol. Once-daily fluticasone 
furoate/vilanterol has recently been approved for the treatment of COPD. 
ICS/LABA combinations, which have been available for many years, have been shown to provide 
improvements in lung function and health status and to reduce symptoms and COPD exacerbations 
(Bateman et al 2014). These are recommended in the Global initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
Disease (GOLD) strategy document, and the selection of treatments is based on the assessment of 
symptoms and risk. 
FS Spiromax is an orally inhaled fixed-dose combination containing the active substances fluticasone 
propionate, an inhaled glucocorticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity in the lungs, and salmeterol 
xinafoate, a selective long-acting inhaled β2 adrenoceptor agonist. This combination of salmeterol / 
fluticasone is a well-known combination of two known active substances and is formulated as 
inhalation powder. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Aerivio Spiromax is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older. 
Asthma 
Aerivio Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate: 
- patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled shortacting β2-
agonist 
or 
- patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 
Aerivio Spiromax is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD, with a FEV1 <60% 
predicted normal (pre-bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant 
symptoms despite regular bronchodilator therapy. 
The proposed therapeutic indication is identical to the therapeutic indications of the reference fixed-
dose combination product. 
The proposed route of administration is for inhalation use.

EMA/486136/2016  
Page 10/50 
 
 
The drug is delivered by an inhalation-driven, multi-dose dry powder inhaler device (the Spiromax 
inhaler). 
This application has been submitted in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10(3) – hybrid 
application – application for a medicinal product referring to a so-called reference medicinal product 
with a Marketing Authorisation in a Member State or in the Community on the basis of a complete 
dossier in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 2001/83/EC and which is or has been 
authorised in accordance with Community provisions in force for not less than 6/10 years in the EEA. 
The reference product was first authorised in Sweden under the brand name Seretide Diskus on 7 
September 1998 and as such has been authorised in the Community for a period exceeding 10 years. 
The marketing authorizations for Seretide Diskus (also known as Seretide Accuhaler in the UK and 
some other markets) have been extended to 29 member states via mutual recognition procedure 
SE/H/0169/001-003/MR and national applications. 
As an orally inhaled product, salmeterol / fluticasone inhalation powder (FS Spiromax) is locally applied 
and locally acting, so conventional bioavailability studies based on systemic measurements may not 
appropriate to establish bioequivalence for this type of product (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 and 
CPMP/EWP239/95 Final). Requirements for demonstrating therapeutic equivalence between two 
inhalation products are described in the ‘OIP Guideline’ (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1, Guideline on the 
requirements for clinical documentation for orally inhaled products (OIP) including the requirements for 
demonstration of therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products for use in the treatment of 
asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as inhalation powder.  Each delivered dose (the dose that leaves the 
mouthpiece) contains 45 micrograms of salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) and 465 micrograms of 
fluticasone propionate. This is equivalent to a metered dose of 50 micrograms of salmeterol (as 
salmeterol xinafoate) and 500 micrograms fluticasone propionate. 
The other ingredient is lactose monohydrate. 
The product is available in a plastic inhaler as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. The inhaler is 
white with a semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover.  The drug/mucosal contact parts of the inhaler 
are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). Each 
inhaler contains 60 doses and is foil-wrapped. The device is an adapted version of the device used in a 
marketed product (DuoResp Spiromax 160 micrograms/4.5 micrograms dry powder inhaler) authorised 
under the centralised procedure.

2.2.2.  Active  substance 
Fluticasone propionate 
General information 
The chemical name of fluticasone propionate is 6α,9-difluoro-17-[[(fluoromethyl)sulfanyl]carbonyl]-
11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-dien-17α-yl propanoate corresponding to the molecular 
formula C25H31F3O5S. It has a relative molecular mass 500.57 g/mol and the following structure: 
 
The active substance is a white to almost white powder, insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in acetone 
and dichloromethane, and slightly soluble in alcohol (96%).  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Only one polymorphic form may be 
encountered in fluticasone propionate when crystallised in conventional conditions. Literature describes 
another polymorphic form (called form II) obtained by crystallisation from supercritical fluids. The 
absence of a higher melting point of form II and the presence of an exothermic event before melting of 
both forms strongly suggest a monotropic system meaning form II can convert into form I but not the 
other way around. It is therefore highly unlikely that fluticasone propionate form I converts into form 
II based on fundamental thermodynamic principles supported by data evidence. In addition, the 
applicant and the active substance manufacturer have committed to provide additional data for the 
crystallisation experiments to confirm the polymorphic form of fluticasone propionate manufactured.   
As there is a monograph of fluticasone propionate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer 
of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for fluticasone propionate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The description of manufacturing process steps and in-process controls, characterisation, control of 
materials and of critical steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process 
development are all covered by the CEP. The active substance is manufactured at one manufacturing 
site.  
In addition the active substance is micronised. The CEP does not cover the micronisation step. The 
active substance manufacturer is responsible for micronisation of the active substance and only limited 
information on micronisation process has been included in the dossier. The Applicant has confirmed 
that the micronisation step is subject to audits by the QP as mentioned in the relevant declaration. The 
information provided was considered acceptable.

Specification 
The control tests comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph, as 
confirmed by the CEP. The CEP includes additional controls for one residual solvent used in the 
manufacturer’s synthetic route and for one related substance. In addition active substance particle size 
distribution test was included in the active substance specification. Active substance amorphous 
content test is included in the active substance manufacturer specifications. 
The active substance specification includes tests for: identity (IR, HPLC), specific optical rotation 
(Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(Ph. Eur., GC), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (laser diffraction), 
amorphous content test* (solution calorimetry). 
*performed only by the active substance manufacturer 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for identification, assay and impurity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data are provided for three production scale batches of the micronised active substance. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
A retest period is specified on the CEP for the non micronised fluticasone propionate. 
Additional stability data were also provided to substantiate the re-test period of the micronised active 
substance. 
Stability data were provided on 12 pilot and production scale batches of micronised active substance 
from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended 
for the market for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines.  
The parameters tested are the same as for release. Particle size results have been provided only on 4 
pilot scale batches and not for all time points. No particle size distribution (PSD) results are presented 
at accelerated conditions. The analytical methods used were the same as for release (except for the 
PSD testing parameters). 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container for 
the non-micronised fluticasone propionate and the proposed retest period in the proposed container for 
the micronized fluticasone propionate.

The chemical name of salmeterol xinafoate is (1RS)-1-[4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]-2-[[6-(4-
phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]ethanol 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylate corresponding to the 
molecular formula C36H45NO7 . It has a relative molecular mass 603.74g/mol and the following 
structure: 
 
 
The active substance is a white to almost white powder, insoluble in water, soluble in methanol and 
slightly soluble in ethanol. 
Salmeterol xinafoate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. Salmeterol 
xinafoate manufactured by the proposed supplier is a racemic mixture.  
Polymorphism has been observed for the active substance. Two polymorphs of salmeterol xinafoate are 
described in the literature. The proposed supplier synthesises the polymorph I which is the most 
thermodynamically stable form at room temperature 
As there is a monograph of salmeterol xinafoate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of 
the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
for salmeterol xinafoate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The description of manufacturing process steps and in-process controls, characterisation, control of 
materials and of critical steps and intermediates, process validation and manufacturing process 
development are all covered by the CEP. The active substance is manufactured at one manufacturing 
site.  
In addition the active substance is micronised. The CEP does not cover the micronization step. The 
active substance manufacturer is responsible for micronization of the drug substances and only limited 
information on micronization process has been included in the dossier. The Applicant has confirmed 
that the micronization step is subject to audits of QP declarations. The information provided is 
considered acceptable. 
Specification 
The control tests comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. monograph, as 
confirmed by the CEP. The CEP includes additional controls for one residual solvent used in the

manufacturer’s synthetic route and for heavy metals. In addition active substance particle size 
distribution and microbiological quality tests were included in the active substance specification.  
The active substance specification includes tests for: identity (IR), assay (Ph. Eur.), related substances 
(Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph.Eur.), heavy metals (ICP-MS), and sulfated ashes 
(Ph. Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (laser diffraction).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three batches of the micronized active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
A retest period is specified on the CEP for the non micronised salmeterol xinafoate. 
Additional stability data are also provided to substantiate the re-test period of the micronised active 
substance.  
Stability data were provided on 4 production scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 
up to 24 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH. 
Stability data were provided on 3 primary scale up scale batches of active substance from the 
proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the 
market for 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. 
In addition, supportive stability data were provided on 3 pilot scale batches. 
In addition to the Ph. Eur. tests, the particle size distribution (PSD) of micronised salmeterol xinafoate 
was tested. Long term stability data for PSD have been provided on 2 production scale batches and on 
the 3 pilot scale batches. No data have been produced under accelerated conditions, which is 
considered acceptable taking into account that the stability of the finished drug product does not 
substantiate any concerns. Further, the micronised active substance raw material is subjected to 
retesting by the finished product manufacturer on a yearly basis. 
All results submitted, are well within the specification, and do not show any trend in any parameter 
tested. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period when stored protected from 
light in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The objective was to develop a dry powder for inhalation containing a fixed dose combination of 
fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate. The product is to be delivered in the Spiromax inhaler,

Assessment report

an inhalation driven multi-dose dry powder delivery device. The product is designed to have an 
equivalent performance to the reference product Seretide Accuhaler 50/500 μg (salmeterol xinafoate 
50 µg/ fluticasone propionate 500 µg inhalation powder) also named Seretide Diskus. As such, the 
finished product has been developed following the EMA “Guideline on the requirements for clinical 
documentation for orally inhaled products including the requirements for demonstration of therapeutic 
equivalence between two inhaled products for use in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease in adults and for the use in the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents” 
(CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1). Akin the reference product, the formulation is a simple combination of 
the two active substances and lactose. 
Lactose is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Solid state characteristics of micronised drug substances are known to affect pharmaceutical 
performance characteristics of the finished products. Therefore, physical characterisation of both active 
substances was conducted in relation to its effect on the functionality of the final product as per EMA 
Guideline “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal products” 
CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr. Particle size, particle shape, rugosity, and crystallinity were studied, as 
these are recognised as the critical material attributes that determine the performance and quality of 
inhalation products. The effect of pre-processing the material (e.g. micronisation) on the physical 
characteristics was also evaluated. Results support the active substance specifications.  
The principles of Quality by Design were applied to the pharmaceutical development, although no 
design space was applied for. The applicant defined key parameters of the reference product (flow 
resistance and dependence, uniformity of delivered dose (UDD) and aerodynamic particle size 
distribution (APSD). Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out to establish relationships between these 
parameters and the in vivo performance (bioequivalence) of each active substance. A quality target 
product profile (QTPP) was then defined as follows: the product should closely match the quality profile 
of Seretide Diskus; it should produce equivalent lung deposition and total systemic exposure to 
Seretide Diskus as demonstrated by equivalent in vivo PK performance; it should meet the quality 
requirements as per EMA Guidance “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal 
Products” (CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr), as well as other relevant quality guidelines. 
Flow resistance and dependence, UDD, and APSD were defined as critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Critical material attributes (CMAs) are particle size distribution (PSD) of both active substances and 
lactose and critical process parameters (CPPs) are mixing time and speed during blending. The 
relationship between APSD and lung deposition was determined and used to guide development. Limits 
for the various CQAs and CPPs required to ensure the desired APSD were established using Design of 
Experiments methodology (DoE). In addition, critical device attributes (CDAs) were compared with 
those of the reference product to ensure equivalent performance of the inhaler. 
During the development of the finished product, the delivered dose (DD) for Seretide in the EU was not 
available. Therefore, it was agreed with the EMA during Scientific Advice, that the DD of the Advair 
product (the US equivalent of Seretide) could be used as the target for the DD of the finished product, 
provided that the DD of Seretide and Advair were demonstrated as being similar. The DD found for the 
Seretide product was in agreement with the DD of the Advair product. The applicant has therefore 
targeted the Advair DD for the finished product development, which correspondingly resulted in 
pharmaceutical in vitro and pharmacokinetic equivalence to Seretide product.

A series of trial formulations using micronised active substances and lactose of varying PSD were 
manufactured and their performance evaluated, first in vitro, and then by PK studies in vivo. Once the 
final formulation had been decided, a further pivotal in vivo PK study was carried out to demonstrate 
bioequivalence to Seretide Diskus.  
The primary packaging is a white inhaler with a semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover. The active 
substance/mucosal contact parts of the inhaler are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), 
polyethylene (PE) , and polypropylene (PP).  The material complies with EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: blending of micronised salmeterol xinafoate 
and micronised fluticasone propionate with lactose monohydrate, filling of the homogeneous powder 
blend into the device sub-assembly followed by assembly of the entire device, equilibration of the filled 
device, packaging and labelling of the filled device. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. Controls are applied to critical steps of the manufacturing process (blending, 
filling, device assembly, packaging) as follow: blend homogeneity testing, measurement of net powder 
weight in each device to ensure correct fill weight, check to ensure each device is assembled correctly, 
actuation check on each device to ensure correct functionality, dose counter check, and leak testing to 
ensure foil pouch seal integrity. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Validation data 
were provided for three production scale batches packaged on a semi-automated line. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. The applicant committed to validate the first three commercial 
batches packed on the automated packaging line. In addition, as the current production scale batch 
size is small, the Applicant committed that any future changes in the proposed batch size will be 
submitted as a Type II variation, supported by appropriate process validation data. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (TLC, UPLC), uniformity of delivered dose (Ph. Eur./In-house), aerodynamic 
assessment of fine particles (NGI) (Ph. Eur./ In-house), number of actuations per inhaler, assay of 
inhaler content (UPLC), related substances (UPLC), moisture content (Ph. Eur),  microbial 
contamination (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications are supported by the clinical and stability batches except for the limits of 
aerodynamic assessment of fine particles for both active substances.  The applicant committed to 
review the limits for both active substances 12 months after launch of the product and tighten them if 
appropriate. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 6 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 3 production scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. Samples were stored inverted or upright. The batches 
of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. In addition supportive stability data from other two strengths 
initially developed were also provided. 
No photostability studies have been performed. Due to the nature of the container closure system 
which protects the formulation from light, this is considered acceptable.  
In-use studies were included in the stability study to simulate removal of the aluminium-foil pouch on 
the first day of use by the patient. Samples stored wrapped at long-term conditions for various periods 
of times were un-wrapped and stored at the same conditions and orientation for an additional 3 
months before testing in order to evaluate the possible effect of a 3 month in-use period. 
Samples were tested according to the release specifications. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
Stability results showed no significant difference when the inhalers were stored under different 
orientations. 
The mean delivered dose results for fluticasone were centered slightly above the target, while 
salmeterol mean delivered dose results were slightly below target. All mean results were well within 
the acceptance limits of 85-115% label claim with the exception of one data point, which was 
significantly below the lower acceptance limit.  This data point also represented OOS results for the 
uniformity of delivered dose. All subsequent time points reported results within specification.  
Following investigations, it was concluded that the OOS might be caused by moisture or 
triboelectrification effects. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to be a stability trend.  
 
The trend of the mean delivered doses was also studied.  A decrease in mean delivered dose was 
observed for both active substances when stored under accelerated conditions and for the first 12 
months under long term conditions. The mean delivered dose stabilized at 12-24 months under long 
term storage conditions. 
A decrease in FPD was observed under long term condition, this decreasing trend sharpens when 
stored as unwrapped.  Correspondingly, the MMAD increases upon storage. For both FDP and MMAD, 
all data were within the proposed specification limits. 
All inhalers tested on stability delivered NLT 60 actuations. No significant changes were observed in the 
moisture content. 
For the assay of inhaler content, all data were within the proposed specification limits even if a slight 
decrease in the assay content was observed for the inhaler during storage. 
Fluticasone was stable over the shelf-life and no significant differences were observed in the related 
substances. In comparison, the related substances for salmeterol have increased during storage.  
However all results are within the proposed specification.  
No microbial growth was observed in stability samples

No significant differences was observed in all parameters tested when the finished product was stored 
unwrapped for up to 3 months. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years, the in-use shelf-life of 3 months 
and the following storage conditions “Do not store above 25˚C. Keep the mouthpiece cover closed 
after removal of the foil wrap” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development 
of the finished product and its manufacturing processes. However, design spaces were not claimed. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- 
the applicant and the active substance manufacturer should generate and provide additional data 
for the crystallisation experiments to confirm the polymorphic form of fluticasone propionate 
- 
the applicant should review  the limits of aerodynamic assessment of fine particles for both active 
substances 12 months after launch of the product and tighten them if appropriate . 
- 
the applicant should validate the first three commercial batches packed on the automated 
packaging line

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has not conducted or sponsored any non-clinical studies using salmeterol xinafoate and 
fluticasone propionateto support this Marketing Authorisation Application as the pharmacological and 
toxicological effects of both salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate are documented in the 
published literature. The Applicant submitted literature data for the non-clinical characterisation of 
salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate and their combination. 
Extractables and leachables testing has not been conducted as this is not required for dry powder 
inhalers, which is an accordance with CHMP Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and 
Nasal Products (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr) and therefore acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Salmeterol 
Salmeterol xinafoate is a selective long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) with a long side chain 
which binds to the exo-site of the receptor used in patients with asthma and COPD. 
Salmeterol belongs to a group of structurally related catecholamine derivatives. It produces a longer 
duration of bronchodilatation (lasting for at least 12 hours) than recommended doses of conventional 
short-acting β2-agonists. β2-adrenoceptor agonist are effective in the management of both asthma and 
COPD. These drugs induce bronchodilatation by causing direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle 
through activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn increases intracellular 3,5-cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate levels. The long duration of salmeterol is considered to be due to its lipophilicity and 
persistence at the receptor site, which allows a twice daily dosing regimen, while the high potency and 
selectivity means that small doses (50 μg bid) are effective, limiting the potential for systemic 
exposure and site effects (Owen et al., 2010). 
In vitro studies showed salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for β2 adrenoceptors than 
salbutamol.  Although β2 adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth 
muscle, there are also β2 adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10 –50% of the total β 
adrenoceptors of the body.  The pharmacologic effects of β2 adrenoceptors agonistic drugs, including 
salmeterol are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme 
that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic-3,5-adenosine monophosphate.  Increased cyclic AMP 
levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate 
hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. 
Three types of β receptors are known; designated β1, β2 and β3. β1-adrenergic receptors are located 
mainly in the heart and in the kidney; β2-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, 
gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth and skeletal muscle, and heart while β3-
adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells. 
Although β2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and 
β1-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also β2-adrenoceptors in the 
human heart comprising 10-50% of the total β-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these is not yet

established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective β2-adrenoceptors may have cardiac 
effects. The selectivity of salmeterol in comparison with other β2-adrenoceptors is summarised in Table 
1 (Dollery, 1999). 
 
Table 1: Receptor potency 
 
Salmeterol has demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo in animals as shown by its 
inhibitory effect on the cellular release of inflammatory mediators, inflammatory cell infiltration and 
plasma protein extravasations. 
Fluticasone propionate 
Non-clinical studies have demonstrated that fluticasone is a highly lipophilic molecule, a characteristic 
which results in rapid penetration into the cells and retention in lung tissue. In vitro fluticasone has 
been demonstrated to inhibit anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T cells, Phytohaemaglutinin stimulated 
proliferation of lymphocytes from volunteers and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8 and tumour necrosis 
factor (TNF) in mast cells.  It also inhibited platelet derived growth factor stimulated production of IL-l-
β and IL-6 in human alveolar macrophage and fibroblast cells.  Fluticasone has been demonstrated to 
possess the highest levels of both lung tissue binding (approximately 4.89 ng/mg) and lipophilicity 
when compared with beclomethasone dipropionate and beclomethasone 17-monopropionate; this 
translates into a sustained duration of action of fluticasone in the respiratory system, and a rapid and 
greater activity with respect to more hydrophilic compounds such as budesonide, flunisolide and 
hydrocortisone. 
Studies in rodents were conducted to quantify and compare anti-inflammatory activity after topical 
administration of fluticasone and the ability to produce specific systemic steroid-related effects after 
topical, oral or parenteral administration. Topical anti-inflammatory activity was measured in rats and 
mice using the inflammatory response to croton oil applied topically to the ear. Results showed that 
fluticasone was essentially equipotent with fluocinolone acetonide in both rats and mice. Systemic 
responses to repeated topical applications of fluticasone were assessed by measurement of thymus 
involution and reduction in stress-induced plasma corticosterone (HPA axis suppression) in rats and 
mice, and adrenal atrophy in the rat. In these tests fluticasone was 50-100 fold less potent than 
fluocinolone acetonide in the rat (56-fold greater therapeutic index) and 100 times less potent than 
fluocinolone acetonide in mice (relative therapeutic index 91). Therefore, in both species, the 
separation between topical antiinflammatory and systemic activity after topical application was highly 
favourable to fluticasone. Comparison of systemic activity after topical and subcutaneous dosing of 
fluticasone shows that, in both rats and particularly in mice, fluticasone is more potent when given 
subcutaneously. After oral dosing in rats, fluticasone caused some thymus involution, adrenal atrophy 
and HPA axis suppression but was 6 to 38 times less potent than betamethasone alcohol. In the 
mouse, oral fluticasone is 60 to 200 times less potent than betamethasone alcohol.

Animal studies of the relative anti-inflammatory and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
inhibitory potencies of topically applied drug demonstrated that fluticasone has an advantageous 
therapeutic index (>200 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate). 
Fluticasone has also been found to have high glucocorticoid-receptor selectivity with highly desirable 
“fast-on, slow-off” receptor kinetics.  The net effect is a Fp-receptor half-life of 10 hours, markedly 
greater than the half-life of beclomethasone and its active metabolite. 
Combination 
There is a strong scientific rationale for combination of these two drug classes.  Although the primary 
effect of LABAs is on β2 receptors, but in addition to their bronchodilatory action, LABAs complement 
the effects of corticosteroids via interaction with glucocorticoid signal transduction.  LABAs can activate 
glucocorticoid receptors and enhance the transcription of anti-inflammatory mediators. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Both formoterol and salmeterol have been shown to inhibit LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-stimulated release 
of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) but not 
CXCL-8 from monocyte-derived macrophages in culture.  
Salmeterol also exhibits a concentration-dependent inhibition of thrombin-stimulated albumin transport 
with an EC of 2.6 nM, via activation of ß2-adrenoceptors on these cells. Salmeterol, by a functional 
antagonist effect mediated by increased intracellular cyclic AMP may maintain the integrity of the 
vascular endothelium, there-by limiting plasma protein extravasation. 
Salmeterol has also been demonstrated to inhibit acute leukocyte influx following endotoxin 
(neutrophils), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and antigen (eosinophils) challenge of guinea pig 
airways in vivo. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Parallel treatment with salmeterol and gestagens can be more than twice as effective as salmeterol 
therapy alone. Preterm birth was induced with a combination of mifepristone and prostaglandin E2 on 
day 19 of pregnancy. Rats were treated with salmeterol or gestagens (progesterone or 17- 
hydroxyprogesterone) or their combination. The treatments were launched on different days (15-18) of 
pregnancy. The efficacy of treatment was determined in terms of the delivery time counted from the 
mifepristone injection. Salmeterol treatment delayed premature labour by 2.4 hours, whereas the 
delay due to gestagen-salmeterol combinations was more than 5 hours. Parallel treatment with 
salmeterol and gestagens can be more than twice as effective as salmeterol therapy alone (Galik et al., 
2008). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Salmeterol is extensively absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract in both rat and dog following oral 
administration.  In repeat-dose, combined oral/inhalation toxicity studies showed that the maximum 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
 
Assessment report  
EMA/486136/2016  
Page 22/50 
 
 
concentrations of salmeterol detected in plasma exceeds by several hundred-fold the maximum 
concentrations (200 pg/ml) determined after the standard therapeutic dose in humans. 
Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; plasma levels therefore do not predict therapeutic effect. 
No firm results of salmeterol P-gp inhibition capability and in vitro studies demonstrating bidirectional 
and induction capabilities of salmeterol could be found in the public domain. Given that salmeterol is 
structurally similar to salbutamol, a known P-gp inhibitor in the same therapeutic class, the Applicant 
suggests that salmeterol can be classified as a class 2 drug and therefore potentially showing clinical 
evidence of P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions. This hypothesis is supported. 
Fluticasone has low oral bioavailability due to poor absorption and extensive first pass metabolism. 
Evidence in support of fluticasone low bioavailability when compared to the other corticosteroids, has 
been obtained by measuring plasma cortisol, as an index of adrenal suppression. Animal 
pharmacokinetic studies have shown that only small percentage of intratracheally orally administered 
compound reaches the systemic circulation, resulting in very low systemic effects typical for 
glucocorticoids. 
On CHMP’s request, the Applicant has submitted information regarding the P-gp bidirectional transport 
and induction capabilities of both fluticasone and salmeterol.  Fluticasone has been seen to increase P-
gp expression by 80% in peripheral blood cell lines but this effect was lost in the equilibrium study, 
suggesting that fluticasone was a poor P-gp substrate.  Furthermore, lack of inhibitory action on the 
movement of other substrates was demonstrated, conversely to budesonide and beclometasone which 
are classified as P-gp inhibitors. 
Plasma levels of fluticasone were not affected by salmeterol administration, as shown in studies in rats 
and dogs. 
Distribution 
Only traces of fluticasone radioactivity pass into the systemic circulation.  When administered orally to 
pregnant rats or rabbits, a very small fraction of the dose (<0.005%) passes across the placenta. 
The distribution of salmeterol xinafoate in body tissues is consistent with that expected of a highly 
lipophilic base.  At least 93% of the salmeterol distributed between erythrocytes and plasma is 
reversibly bound to the plasma proteins, β1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, in the mouse, rat, rabbit, 
dog and man.  Salmeterol showed high plasma clearance, indicating that changes in the degree of 
protein binding are unlikely to influence the rate of elimination.  
Following oral and intravenous administration of 14C-salmeterol xinafoate in rats, the highest 
concentrations were observed in bile ducts, kidney medulla and liver, by intestinal content, heart, 
pituitary, bone marrow, lung and stomach/small intestine wall. Lower concentrations of radioactivity 
were retrieved in blood, whereas only trace amounts were detected in the central nervous system. The 
extent of binding of salmeterol to mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and human plasma proteins in vitro was 
~95% and was independent of drug concentration. 
On CHMP’s request, the Applicant has provided information regarding the distribution sites of 
fluticasone and salmeterol. In a single oral dose study in rats using radioactive fluticasone, 
radioactivity was detected in the stomach and its contents, the jejunum and large intestine. Other 
organs showing significant levels of radioactivity were the liver and brown fat and to a lesser degree 
the adrenals, pancreas and skin. Following intravenous administration, the kidneys also showed 
significant levels of radioactivity. Following oral or intravenous administration at its peak levels, 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
 
Assessment report  
EMA/486136/2016  
Page 23/50 
 
 
radioactivity in the plasma was <1% of that found in the liver. In 6-hour disposition studies in rats and 
dogs following inhalation with radioactive fluticasone, the lungs showed the highest levels of 
radioactivity. Distribution studies of aerosolized fluticasone in rats and dogs indicate that the highest 
levels were found in the lungs of both species. Fluticasone binds to the same high degree (94.6 – 
96.5%) to plasma proteins of rats, dogs and humans. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Both salmeterol and fluticasone are substrates of CYP3A4. Since the compounds are lipophilic and act 
locally in the lung, the resulting low plasma concentrations following inhalation are not predictive of 
therapeutic effect. Therefore, although both substances are substrates of cytochrome CYP3A4, the risk 
of a DDI is negligible at the low inhalation doses intended for clinical use. 
Hepatic clearance is predominantly responsible for the clearance of salmeterol and fluticasone, 
meaning that patients with hepatic disease who receive salmeterol and fluticasone should be closely 
monitored and caution is recommended when salmeterol and fluticasone are co-administered with 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, as stated into the SmPC. 
Following repeat dosing of salmeterol / fluticasone combination by inhalation in rat and dog toxicity 
studies, plasma levels were not affected by each other. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies conducted individually or in combination demonstrated no specific target 
organ toxicity. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat inhalation studies were performed in rats and dogs.  Focal coronary arthritis occurred 
transiently and sporadically in Wistar rats but not in dogs or Sprague Dawley rats exposed daily to 
salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate.  In 2-week inhalation studies in dogs, 
salmeterol-related pulse rate increases were slightly more marked in groups given the combination 
compared with those given salmeterol alone.  However, there were no significant effects of the 
combination on ECG or on cardiac histopathology in these species. 
Genotoxicity 
None of the compounds revealed genotoxic potential.   
Carcinogenicity 
None of the compounds revealed carcinogenic potential.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The results coming from the reprotoxicity studies indicate that no major safety issue occurred following 
administration of each compound or the combination. 
Glucocorticosteroids have, however, been shown to induce malformations (cleft palate, skeletal 
malformations) in animal experimental studies, but these findings may not be relevant for man given 
the recommended doses. Animal studies with salmeterol have shown embryofetal toxicity only at high 
exposure levels. Co-administration of salmeterol and fluticasone to rats, led to increased incidences of 
transposed umbilical artery and incomplete ossification of occipital bone, effects seen at doses 
associated with known glucocorticoid- induced abnormalities. 
Toxicokinetic data 
There was no drug interaction in the pharmacological and toxicity studies between salmeterol and 
fluticasone. 
Local Tolerance  
With regards to the local tolerance potential of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate, these 
were found not to be irritating to the eye or the respiratory tract of the species examined. 
Other toxicity studies  
Studies in Juvenile Animals 
Two studies were performed using juvenile rats. Animals were dosed daily using the subcutaneous 
route to increase bioavailability relative to the inhaled route. Doses ranged from 0.4 to 10 μg/kg/day 
administered from day 3 of life until day 44. Animals receiving the higher doses of fluticasone 
manifested the standard effects associated with drugs of the glucocorticoid class. No effects on growth 
or indices of sexual maturation were seen at the lower doses. 
However, some animals dosed at the higher levels of 5 or 10 μg/kg/day did show a reduction in the 
rate of weight gain. There was no reported effect on sexual maturation. 
A 52-week study was performed using 24 juvenile beagle dogs. Fluticasone was administered twice 
daily with doses started at 1500 μg for the first 8 weeks, then were reduced to 750 μg for the 
remainder of the study. Delivered doses were calculated to be as high as 140 μg/kg/day for the first 
week, to as low as approximately 25 μg/kg/day by the end of the study. The results of this study 
confirm the typical clinical and laboratory changes associated with prolonged administration of a potent 
glucocorticoid. The animals were “stunted” in overall growth and showed a reduction in long bone 
length. A decrease in the expected length of the trachea was also reported. The lowest dose of 25 
μg/kg/day that produced developmental effects observed in this study was greater than five times the 
highest expected dose delivered to an average 4 year old pediatric patient weighing 15 kg and 
receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 200 μg. However, FS Spiromax is not indicated for 
children below 18 years of age. 
Studies on Excipients 
The only excipient used in the final drug product, lactose monohydrate (lactose) is well characterised 
and corresponds with the Pharm Eur.  Each dose contains approximately 10 mg of lactose (as 
monohydrate). In the non-clinical overview the Applicant explains that the excipient used in the final 
Medicinal product no longer authorised
 
Assessment report  
EMA/486136/2016  
Page 25/50 
 
 
drug product, lactose monohydrate, may contain trace amounts of milk protein which may cause 
reactions in patients with hypersensitivity or allergy to milk protein.  In addition, lactose is 
contraindicated in patients with galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or with glucose-
galactose malabsorption and patients with these rare hereditary problems should not take this 
medicine.  This has been adequately addressed in the product information. 
Studies on Impurities 
Limits for related substances, impurities and degradation products are in accordance with current ICH 
Guideline ICH Q3B (CPMP/ICH/2738/99) and are based on the maximum daily doses of salmeterol 
xinafoate / fluticasone propionate. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted.  This was justified by the Applicant as the 
introduction of FS Spiromax 500 microgram/50 microgram inhalation powder containing  fluticasone 
propionate and salmeterol xinafoate is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate containing products and 
the exposure of the environment to the active substance.  Moreover, the patient population for FS 
Spiromax will be even smaller, as it is indicated only in adults aged 18 years and older, whereas the 
reference product is also indicted in a younger population. The Applicant has provided additional 
evidence using IMS Market Data from June 2015 to demonstrate that the market for DPI combination 
products containing fluticasone in both the EU and Germany has not increased over the past 6 and 10 
years, respectively.  Since the introduction of FS Spiromax 500 microgram/50 microgram inhalation 
powder is intended for generic substitution, it is considered that this will not lead to an increase in 
environmental exposure to fluticasone.  Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased and 
therefore salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate is considered unlikely to present a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo were described in 
the literature with salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate alone and in combination. The 
Applicant has not conducted or sponsored any non-clinical studies using budesonide and formoterol to 
support this Marketing Authorisation Application as the pharmacological and toxicological effects of 
both salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate are documented in the published literature. The 
Applicant relied on the literature on the non-clinical characterisation of salmeterol xinafoate and 
fluticasone propionate and their combination. This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Hepatic clearance is predominantly responsible for the clearance of salmeterol xinafoate and 
fluticasone propionate, meaning that patients with hepatic disease who receive salmeterol and 
fluticasone should be closely monitored and caution is recommended when salmeterol and fluticasone 
is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, as stated into the product information. 
The only excipient used in the final drug product, lactose monohydrate (lactose) is well characterised 
and corresponds with the Pharm Eur.  This excipient may contain trace amounts of milk protein which 
may cause reactions in patients with hypersensitivity or allergy to milk protein.  In addition, lactose is 
contraindicated in patients with galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or with glucose-
galactose malabsorption and patients with these rare hereditary problems should not take this 
medicine.  This has been adequately addressed in the product information.

The justification for the absence of an environmental risk assessment ERA is acceptable and an ERA is 
not deemed necessary. FS Spiromax is considered unlikely to present a risk to the environment when 
use as prescribed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
On the basis of the considerable amount of published scientific evidences on salmeterol xinafoate / 
fluticasone propionate combination, the CHMP concluded that salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone 
propionate inhalation powder produces the claimed pharmacological activity and can be safely 
administered within therapeutic indication. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The development of this new fixed-dose combination orally inhaled product (OIP) follows the CHMP 
Guideline on OIPs (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) and aims to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of 
this new product to the reference product authorised in a Member State or in the Community on the 
basis of a complete dossier. The development is based on the demonstration of pharmacokinetic 
equivalence between this new fixed-dose combination in one high strength and the corresponding 
strength of the reference product. The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on several 
occasions pertaining to quality and clinical aspects of the dossier. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted four clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, two 
pilot studies, (Studies FSC-AS-101 and FSS-AS-104) comparing different batches and devices and two 
pivotal studies, (Studies FSS-BE-107 and FSS-BE-10020), which were identical studies bar the 
administration of activated charcoal in Study FSS-BE-10020. No pharmacodynamic (PD) studies or 
Phase 3 clinical efficacy or safety studies have been conducted comparing the test and reference 
products in any population.  
The modified Spiromax device used in pilot study, Study FSS-AS-104, was used in both pivotal 
pharmacokinetic studies and is the device proposed for the market.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
The studies were single center, open label, single dose, crossover studies to compare the salmeterol 
xinafoate and fluticasone propionate following FS Spiromax 50/500μg and Seretide Accuhaler 
50/500μg, administered to healthy volunteers. Two inhalations of each product were administered in 
order to optimize the ability to quantify salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate over their 
entire PK profile. Apart from the administration of charcoal in Study FSS-BE-10020, the 2 pivotal 
studies were identical in design and were conducted at the same study site within the same year using 
the same batch of FS Spiromax. 
Pilot Studies 
FSC-AS-101 primary objective: 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of fluticasone 
propionate (FP) and salmeterol xinafoate (SAL) in 18 healthy volunteers following 2 inhalations from 2 
batches of FS Spiromax 50/500µg and Seretide Accuhaler 50/500µg.

Analytical methods  
Blood samples for determining the plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol 
were collected. Plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol were determined using 
validated liquid chromatography/tandem/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods for each of these 
drugs in human plasma. All reported concentration data were obtained from analytical runs that met 
the acceptance criteria of the Standard Operating Procedures and which were performed in accordance 
with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations in compliance with FDA regulations.  The analysis 
period was 29 April 2013-28 June 2013 for Study FSS-BE-107 and 03 December 2103-28 January 
2014 for Study FSS-BE-10020.The analytical reports were provided together with a statement of GLP 
compliance. 
Certificates of Analysis for each reference standard (fluticasone propionate, fluticasone propionate-d3 
and salmeterol, salmeterol-d3) were provided and purity was adequate. 
Analyte stability was evaluated under various conditions; the long term stability demonstrated that the 
spiking solution was stable for 85 and 93 days at -20ºC for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol 
respectively. 
On CHMP’s request, the Applicant has clarified the maximum sample storage time and conditions were 
within the validated storage duration and conditions. 
The Applicant has also stated that samples with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol concentrations 
above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) were diluted to fall within the standard curve range. The 
dilution integrity was demonstrated in the validation report. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The primary endpoints in the pivotal pharmacokinetic bioequivalence studies (Studies FSS-BE-107 and 
FSS-BE-10020) were: 
• 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable 
concentration as measured up to 24 hours post-dose (AUC0-t) and, 
• 
maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)  
for both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate. 
The primary endpoint in the pilot pharmacokinetic bioequivalence studies (Studies FSC-AS-101 and 
FSS-AS-104) was AUC0-t with Cmax as a secondary endpoint. 
Statistical methods   
All pharmacokinetic parameters for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate were calculated 
using non-compartmental analysis methods from the plasma concentration-time data. 
The AUC and Cmax data were natural log-transformed prior to the statistical analysis. Comparisons of 
AUC and Cmax between treatments were carried out using a parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model with sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects and a random effect of subject within 
sequence.  The least squares means (LSMs) and the difference between LSMs were obtained from the 
ANOVA.  Ratios of LSM were calculated using the exponentiation of the LSM from the analysis of the 
log transformed AUC and Cmax values.  These ratios were expressed for the test relative to the 
reference formulation.  The 90% CIs for the treatment ratios were derived.

In the pivotal studies (Studies FSS-BE-107 and FSS-BE-10020), the two products were considered 
equivalent for AUC0-t and Cmax if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the ratios of geometric means 
for both fluticasone and salmeterol were contained within the 0.8 to 1.25 range. 
The non-parametric analysis of the time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) and 
terminal phase half-life (t½) was performed based on the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  The Hodges-
Lehman estimator and estimated CI were used to examine the location shift in tmax in the pivotal 
studies (FSS-BE-107 and FSS-BE-10020). 
The pharmacokinetic analysis set was the pre-specified primary population for analyses of the 
pharmacokinetic data in the pivotal studies (FSS-BE-107 and FSS-BE-10020).  It included all 
randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication with sufficient data to 
calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC0-t and Cmax from any treatment period prior to 
experiencing a major protocol violation. 
Major protocol violations were determined prior to database lock which could have resulted in the 
exclusion of one subject from the pharmacokinetic analysis set for one or more than one treatment 
period.  Subjects were analyzed under the treatment they actually received, as opposed to the 
treatment sequence in which they were randomized. 
In the pilot studies FSC-AS-101 and FSS-AS-104, the primary analysis set for the pharmacokinetic 
analysis was planned to be the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set.  However pharmacokinetic data were 
to be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis if they met the criteria of non-zero baseline 
concentrations >5% of the corresponding Cmax or lack of any measurable concentrations or very low 
plasma concentrations for the reference medicinal product as per the CHMP Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr* 20 January 2010), which led to 
the removal of one subject in one period in the pharmacokinetic analysis in Study FSS-AS-104 (per 
protocol [PP] analysis set).

Flow Rate – Drug Delivery Relationships for the Spiromax and Accuhaler Devices 
In vitro comparison of the test product (FS Spiromax) and the reference product (Seretide Accuhaler) 
has been conducted according to the CHMP guideline for orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 
Rev.1). Data have been generated for the complete particle size distribution profile of individual stages 
of a validated multistage impactor (next generation impactor (NGI)).  Seretide Accuhaler data were 
generated in accordance with the Patient Information Leaflet for the reference product.  The full results 
of the aerodynamic particle size distribution characteristics of FS Spiromax and Seretide Accuhaler 
were provided. 
The results of the in vitro flow rate comparison conducted to investigate whether the flow rate 
dependence of the FS Spiromax device matched that of Seretide Accuhaler are presented below.

Spiromax 50/500μg and Seretide Accuhaler 50/500μg 
 
In vitro flow rate comparison was conducted to investigate whether the flow rate dependence of the FS 
Spiromax device matched that of Seretide Accuhaler; a lower FPD is seen at the lower flow rates of 45 
and 60L/min and lower total delivered dose is seen at all four flow rates studied, 45, 60, 80 and 
100L/min, for the salmeterol xinafoate component of FS Spiromax compared with the salmeterol 
xinafoate component of Seretide Accuhaler, as measured with the Next Generation Impactor.   
Therefore the Applicant has been asked to discuss these findings in the light of the pharmacokinetic 
data presented in healthy volunteers inhaling with flow rates in excess of 60L/min and discuss the 
clinical relevance of these findings in patients with either asthma or COPD and inhaling with flow rates 
less than 60L/min.   
Inhalation Characteristics of Patients with Asthma, Patients with COPD and Healthy Adult 
Volunteers 
In order to demonstrate that the flow rates through FS Spiromax and Seretide Accuhaler did not differ 
between patients with asthma/COPD, with potentially lower flow rates, compared with healthy 
volunteers and to assess the impact of enhanced training in DPI technique on inhalation speed and 
volume, the Applicant submitted a clinical study.  
The mean peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) was measured pre- and post-training of the inhalation 
technique. The training was conducted using the IN-Check Dial, a device comparable with that used in 
the FS Spiromax studies, to ensure all subjects were able to achieve an adequate inspiratory flow rate 
from each device.

Information from healthy volunteers was included in order to directly compare a group of patients with 
asthma with a group of healthy volunteers who were similar to the healthy volunteers who participated 
in the pharmacokinetic studies presented above in the development programme in support of this new 
fixed-dose combination, Studies FSC-AS-101 and FSS-AS-104 (pilot studies) and Studies FSS-BE-107 
and FSS-BE-10020 (pivotal studies). 
Five different age groups were studies, as follows: 
• 
children with stable asthma, aged 4-11 years 
• 
adolescents with stable asthma, aged 12-17 years 
• 
adults with stable asthma, aged 18-45 years 
• 
adults with stable COPD, aged over 55 years 
• 
healthy volunteers, aged 18-45 years. 
The findings were as follows:

Regardless of age and underlying disease, children, adolescents and adults with asthma and patients 
with COPD can achieve inspiratory flow rates through both the Spiromax device and Accuhaler device.   
Following training, adolescents and adults with asthma and patients with COPD are able to achieve 
inspiratory flow rates through both the Spiromax device and the Accuhaler device greater than 
60L/min and similar to the range of flow rates observed in the pharmacokinetic equivalence studies 
carried out in healthy volunteers.  While flow through both devices was somewhat lower in patients

with asthma and patients with COPD compared with healthy volunteers, the mean PIFR achieved by 
patients with asthma and patients with COPD pre-training was greater than 60L/min with a minimum 
PIFR greater than 40L/min, whereas post-training the minimum PIFR achieved in these subject groups 
was greater than 60L/min.  Such flow rates (greater than 60L/min) are flow rates at which both the FS 
Spiromax device and the Seretide Accuhaler device are known/have been shown to deliver comparable 
amounts of drug to the lungs (pivotal pharmacokinetic studies, Study FSS-BE-107 and Study FSS-BE-
10020).  
Conclusions 
The development of this new fixed-dose combination orally inhaled product aims to demonstrate 
therapeutic equivalence of these new products to an appropriate reference product and the 
development is based on the demonstration of in vitro equivalence or pharmacokinetic equivalence 
between a single high strength of this fixed-dose combination of salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone 
propionate and the corresponding strength of the reference product. 
Four pharmacokinetic studies are presented, two pilot studies, Studies FSC-AS-101 and FSS-AS-104 
and two studies described as pivotal, Studies FSS-BE-107 and FSS-BE-10020. 
The two pivotal studies were well designed, had appropriate objectives and were adequately powered 
to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between the test and reference product. The statistical 
analysis is acceptable. 
Full bioanalytical reports for the pivotal studies have been provided. These reports are in general 
acceptable.  The Applicant has also stated that samples with salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone 
propionate concentrations above the ULOQ were diluted to fall within the standard curve range. The 
dilution integrity was demonstrated in the validation report. 
The clinical development of FS Spiromax was based on showing pharmacokinetic bioequivalence 
between FS Spiromax (salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate 50/500µg) and Seretide Accuhaler 
or Seretide Diskus (salmeterol xinafoate 50µg and fluticasone propionate 500µg) in the absence 
(Study FSS-BE-107) and in the presence (Study FSS-BE-10020) of a charcoal blockade. Indeed, in 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline for orally inhaled products (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1). “A 
pharmacokinetic study designed to assess pulmonary deposition, has to be able to exclude absorption 
of the active moiety from the gastrointestinal tract (for example by using charcoal blockade).  A 
pharmacokinetic study may be used for determination of pulmonary deposition but may also 
investigate systemic safety.  In the investigation of systemic safety total systemic exposure has to be 
measured in the intended patient population and therefore the study must include the measurement of 
that amount of the active moiety absorbed through the lung and the gastrointestinal tract.  
…. it may be possible for substances with negligible gastrointestinal absorption that the 
pharmacokinetic study designed to assess pulmonary deposition may be sufficient in the assessment of 
therapeutic equivalence. 
In accordance with the standard accepted methods of assessment of bioequivalence the maximum 
concentration (Cmax), the area under the curve (AUC) and the time to Cmax (Tmax) should be compared.  
Equivalent pulmonary deposition and equivalent systemic safety of two inhaled products may be 
concluded if the 90 % confidence interval for each parameter lies within the acceptance range of 0.8 to 
1.25.” 
It is established that following oral inhalation of salmeterol xinafoate some 28-36% of the total

Page 37/50 
 
 
systemic availability comes from that part of the dose that is swallowed and not inhaled into the lungs 
therefore in order to characterise that portion of the long-acting β2 agonist absorbed only through the 
lungs, as a surrogate for clinical efficacy, the pharmacokinetic parameters was measured following the 
oral ingestion of activated charcoal to block gastrointestinal absorption. The measurement of the total 
systemic exposure (systemic safety) of salmeterol xinafoate was measured in the absence of charcoal 
blockade as the active drug absorbed through both the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. 
In respect of fluticasone propionate and due to extensive (≥99%) first pass hepatic metabolism, oral 
bioavailability is negligible and therefore the systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was 
described as entirely derived from pulmonary absorption. 
Equivalence of FS Spiromax 50/500μg and Seretide Accuhaler 50/500μg was demonstrated both 
without charcoal blockade (Study FSS-BE-107) and  in the presence of charcoal blockade (Study FSS-
BE-10020)  with respect to AUC0–t and Cmax (primary variables) for both fluticasone propionate and 
salmeterol xinafoate.  
In Study FSS-BE-107 the pharmacokinetic ratios were all close to unity with 90% CIs well within the 
accepted bioequivalence range of 0.8, 1.25 for both actives; however, both the lower and upper 
bounds of the CIs for the inhaled corticosteroid were above unity.  This finding with fluticasone 
propionate recurs but is more exaggerated in the second pivotal study, Study FSS-BE-10020, the 
study with charcoal blockade, where it is to note that although both the lower and upper bounds of the 
CIs were above unity, the upper bound is very close to the upper limit of the accepted bioequivalence 
range.  In Study FSS-BE-10020 the pharmacokinetic comparisons for salmeterol xinafoate were also all 
above unity but with the 90% CIs well within the accepted bioequivalence range of 0.8-1.25.  
The findings in these two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies support therapeutic equivalence between the 
test product, FS Spiromax 50/500μg and the reference product in respect of efficacy (pulmonary 
deposition and absorption as a surrogate for efficacy in both Study FSS-BE-107 and Study FSS-BE-
10020 for fluticasone propionate and in Study FSS-BE-10020 for salmeterol xinafoate) and safety 
(total systemic absorption, pulmonary and gastrointestinal, in Study FSS-BE-107 and Study FSS-BE-
10020 for fluticasone propionate and in Study FSS-BE-107 for salmeterol xinafoate). 
The findings in the two pivotal studies demonstrate that the final formulation, the final device and the 
manufacturing process for this new fixed-dose orally inhaled fixed dose combination product containing 
the actives fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate formulated as an inhalation powder in one 
high strength, as FS Spiromax 50/500μg, are robust and can provide an equivalent in vivo 
performance to that of the same dose of the reference product. 
In the in vitro flow rate comparison conducted to investigate whether the flow rate dependence of the 
FS Spiromax device matched that of Seretide Accuhaler, lower fine particle dose is seen at the lower 
flow rates of 45 and 60L/min and lower total dose is seen at all four flow rates studied, 45, 60, 80 and 
100L/min for salmeterol xinafoate as measured with the Next Generation Impactor. At the CHMP’s 
request, the Applicant has discussed these findings in the light of the pharmacokinetic data presented 
in healthy volunteers inhaling with flow rates in excess of 60L/min and has discussed the clinical 
relevance and impact of these findings in patients with severe COPD and severe asthma or other 
causes of severely impaired inspiratory capacity and inhaling with flow rates less than 60L/min. 
The CHMP concluded that this difference is unlikely to contribute to differences in systemic exposure 
particularly when patients with asthma and patients with COPD are trained in the use of the Spiromax 
device in order to achieve inspiratory flow rates through the device of greater than 60L/min. As a 
consequence, additional advice was added to the product information relating to training in optimal use 
of the device, to minimise any risk of underdosing as a consequence of low inspiratory flow rates.

Based on the presented bioequivalence studies FS Spiromax is considered bioequivalent to Seretide 
Accuhaler 50 microgram/500 microgram/dose inhalation powder, pre-dispensed. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of the individual components has been investigated extensively and is well known. The 
efficacy of these two active substances when formulated as a fixed-dose combination product as in the 
reference product has also been investigated extensively. 
No specific clinical studies are presented. 
Indications: 
In the initial submission, the Applicant proposed a similar indication to the reference product for the 
regular treatment of asthma in adults aged 18 years and older, in whom the use of a fixed-dose 
combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2 agonist is appropriate and an indication 
for the symptomatic treatment of adults with COPD (FEV1 <60% predicted normal, pre-bronchodilator) 
with a history of repeated exacerbations and who have significant symptoms despite regular 
bronchodilator therapy. 
The reference product is indicated for the treatment of asthma (low, mid and high – 50/500µg - 
strengths) and for the treatment of COPD (high strength: 50/500 μg). FS Spiromax has been 
developed in the 50/500µg strength corresponding to the high strength of the reference product. 
Asthma 
The highest strength if this fixed-dose combination should not be used for treatment initiation or for 
maintenance therapy for moderate asthma.   
Furthermore, this single high strength will have no role in the initial treatment of patients with mild to 
moderate persistent asthma and the absence of the low and mid dose strengths of FS Spiromax does 
not allow for downward titration of the dose of the inhaled corticosteroid component to attain the 
minimally effective dose to control asthma, which is an essential part of asthma management. Hence, 
there is a risk that when using FS Spiromax  in the management of asthma, the dose of inhaled 
corticosteroid prescribed may not be titrated downwards as asthma is brought under control. 
Therefore, patients may be maintained on too high a dose of inhaled corticosteroid for too long a 
period of time.  
Considering the above, the CHMP requested that the Applicant restrict the asthma indication to 
patients with severe asthma only. The Applicant agreed to this proposal.  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
The CHMP is of the view that the proposed indication for use in the management of chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease is acceptable.

Special populations 
Elderly patients 
No specific clinical studies have been submitted. This is acceptable. Further to the pharmacokinetic 
studies in healthy volunteers the Applicant has submitted a study of the inhalation characteristics of 
healthy adult volunteers (aged 18 to 45 years), adults (18 to 45 years), adolescents (12 to 17 years) 
and children (4 to 11 years) with stable asthma and adults over 55 years of age with stable COPD in 
order to bridge the findings in the pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers to the target patient 
populations in whom these fixed-dose combination products will be used (Chrystyn et al, 2014).  
Although the elderly were not studied per se, the inhalation characteristics in patients with COPD and 
over 55 years of age were and such is acceptable in the stead of a specific study of the elderly over 65 
years of age. 
Children and adolescents 
The Applicant did not seek an indication for use in children (12 years of age and younger) or 
adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years). 
2.4.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data are available from 4 FS Spiromax 50/500 μg studies conducted in healthy volunteers. 
The main objective of this safety evaluation is to assess whether, from a clinical safety perspective, FS 
Spiromax 50/500 μg has a similar safety profile compared with Seretide Accuhaler. 
No formal integration of the safety data from the clinical studies was performed due to the study 
designs employed (4 single-dose crossover PK studies) in healthy volunteers.  
In all studies, adverse events were collected from the time of informed consent to the end of study 
visit. A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that began or that 
worsened in severity after at least 1 dose of the study medication had been administered. The adverse 
events were reviewed for intensity, relationship to treatment and seriousness. The adverse events are 
coded using Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) coding dictionary, Version 11.1 
or higher. The following were also assessed at screening and at the end of study: vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, ECG results and changes in physical examination findings. Vital signs were also 
measured each day during the treatment periods. 
Adverse events 
The PK studies were all single-dose crossover studies and therefore provide limited safety information. 
The nature and intensity of adverse events for FS Spiromax 50/500 μg was very similar to that for 
Seretide Accuhaler. Headache was the most common adverse event in each of the PK studies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths have been reported in this clinical development programme. One serious adverse event was 
reported after randomization but prior to treatment in the treatment period in Study FSS-BE-10020, 
where a subject experienced severe syncope in combination with muscle spasms, nausea, and 
vomiting, which required hospitalization. The observed events were assessed to have no causal 
relationship to the study drug. The subject was withdrawn and the serious adverse event resolved 
without sequelae. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory tests were assessed at screening and at the end of study in each study. Across all 
studies, no treatment-related trends were observed in mean absolute values or changes from baseline 
of any of the clinical chemistry, haematology or urinalysis parameters following dosing with either FS 
Spiromax 50/500 μg or Seretide Accuhaler. There were few clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities reported in any study and examination of out of range values at screening and end of 
study did not indicate any clinically relevant findings with regard to administration of FS Spiromax 
50/500 μg. 
Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram and Physical Examinations 
Assessments of vital signs, ECGs and physical examinations were conducted at screening and at the 
end of study in each study. Across all studies, no treatment-related trends were observed for any vital 
sign parameter, and individual vital sign changes in each study were minimal following dosing with 
either FS Spiromax 50/500 μg or Seretide Accuhaler. No clinically significant abnormalities were 
reported that were considered relevant with regard to FS Spiromax 50/500 μg administration. 
Likewise, ECG values (PR, QT, QRS, QTc and heart rate) remained within the reference range and no 
significant trends were noted from the screening visit to the end of study visit. No clinically significant 
ECG findings were reported in any of the PK studies following dosing with FS Spiromax 50/500 μg or 
Seretide Accuhaler that were considered relevant with regard to FS Spiromax 50/500 μg 
administration. 
Finally, there were no clinically relevant changes in physical examination findings from screening to the 
end of study visit that were considered related to treatment with FS Spiromax 50/500 μg. 
2.4.6.  Post marketing experience 
Seretide Diskus has been marketed in the EU for over 10 years for the treatment of asthma (3 
strengths) and for the treatment of COPD (50/500 μg (high) strength). Salmeterol/fluticasone was first 
approved in the US in 2000. 
Asthma 
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate is generally well tolerated in adults, adolescents and children with 
asthma (McKeage and Keam 2009). Overall, the most frequent treatment-related adverse effects 
include upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, headaches and throat irritation/cough. In clinical 
trials, the incidence of treatment-related effects was generally similar to that of comparators, including 
fluticasone propionate alone, montelukast or formoterol/budesonide. The Cochrane review by

Assessment report

Page 41/50 
 
 
Lasserson et al 2011 reported that odds of experiencing any adverse event were similar between 
salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate and budesonide/formoterol (3 studies, N = 3547; OR 
1.00, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.15). Differences between treatments in the odds of headache (OR1.08, 95% CI 
0.82 to 1.43), candidiasis (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.00), upper respiratory tract infection (OR 1.09, 
95% CI 0.81 to 1.47), dysphonia (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.43) and throat irritation did not differ 
significantly between treatments. Study withdrawals were not significantly more frequent with either 
treatment in terms of overall discontinuations or discontinuations because of adverse events. 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
In the Cochrane review by Nannini et al 2013, no significant difference was noted between salmeterol 
xinafoate / fluticasone and placebo in the occurrence of overall reported adverse events (OR 1.09, 
95% CI 0.95 to 1.25) or serious adverse events (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.23). 
A significant increase in adverse events of pneumonia was recorded with salmeterol xinafoate / 
fluticasone propionate in comparison with placebo (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.18). Candidiasis, 
nasopharyngitis, hoarseness and upper-respiratory tract infection also occurred more frequently 
among salmeterol xinafoate / fluticasone propionate 50/500µg -treated subjects than with placebo. 
Withdrawals because of adverse events occurred less frequently on treatment with salmeterol 
xinafoate / fluticasone propionate than with placebo. 
2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The Applicant sought an indication for the regular treatment of asthma in adults aged 18 years and 
older, in whom the use of a fixed-dose combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2 
agonist is appropriate. The Applicant also sought an indication for the symptomatic treatment of adults 
with COPD (FEV1<60% predicted normal, pre-bronchodilator) with a history of repeated exacerbations 
and who have significant symptoms despite regular bronchodilator therapy. 
The efficacy and safety of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate 50/500µg have been 
investigated extensively, are well known. 
The efficacy and safety of these two active substances when formulated as a fixed-dose combination 
product as in the reference product have also been investigated extensively and this fixed-dose 
combination is well established. 
The clinical dossier comprises four pharmacokinetic studies (two pilot studies and two pivotal studies) 
all carried out in male and female healthy volunteers, aged between 18 and 45 years and one study to 
determine whether flow rates through the Spiromax and Accuhaler devices differ between patients with 
stable asthma, including adults aged 18 to 45 years, adolescents aged 12 to 17 years and children 
aged 4 to 11 years and patients with COPD aged over 55 years, compared with healthy volunteers 
aged 18 to 45 years. 
The lack of the submission of a full clinical efficacy programme is acceptable in this type of application 
and is in line with the CHMP Guideline for orally inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) 
providing that either in vitro equivalence and/or pharmacokinetic equivalence and/or 
pharmacodynamic therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated. In this application pharmacokinetic 
equivalence between FS Spiromax and the reference product both administered in one high strength, 
has been demonstrated.  
Medicinal product no longer authorised
 
Assessment report  
EMA/486136/2016  
Page 42/50 
 
 
Hence, no new pharmacodynamic or efficacy studies were presented and no such studies are required 
for this application. 
The findings in the two pivotal pharmacokinetic studies submitted support therapeutic equivalence 
between the test product, FS Spiromax 50/500μg and the reference product in respect of efficacy 
(pulmonary deposition and absorption as a surrogate for efficacy in both Study FSS-BE-107 and Study 
FSS-BE-10020 for fluticasone propionate and in Study FSS-BE-10020 for salmeterol xinafoate) and 
safety (total systemic absorption, pulmonary and gastrointestinal, in Study FSS-BE-107 and Study 
FSS-BE-10020 for fluticasone propionate and in Study FSS-BE-107 for salmeterol xinafoate). 
Compared with Seretide Accuhaler, currently available on the market in low, mid and high strengths, 
FS Spiromax is proposed for marketing, based on bioequivalence studies carried out in only one high 
strength. This single high strength will have no role in the initial treatment of or maintenance of 
patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma and will not allow down-titration of the inhaled 
corticosteroid component of the fixed-dose combination in patients in whom asthma is controlled on 
this single high strength, to a lower dose of corticosteroid at which control of symptoms would be 
maintained. Therefore, the CHMP requested the Applicant to restrict the indication to patients with 
severe asthma only. The Applicant agreed to this proposal and revised information in the adult 
population, aged 18 years and older is as follows: 
- for the regular treatment of patients with severe asthma where use of a combination product (inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: patients not adequately controlled on a lower 
strength corticosteroid combination product, or patients already controlled on a high dose inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist, 
- for the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD, with a FEV1<60% predicted normal (pre-
bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant symptoms despite 
regular bronchodilator therapy 
In addition, the CHMP recommends the Applicant to complete the development of both the low and 
mid strengths of FS Spiromax as soon as possible. Due to the lack of the low and mid strengths of this 
orally inhaled fixed-dose combination product when prescribed for use in asthma there is a risk that 
the dose of inhaled corticosteroid prescribed in the management of asthma may be too high, it may 
not be titrated downwards as asthma is brought under control and the patient may end up on a dose of 
the inhaled corticosteroid which may be too high for too long a period of time.   
The Applicant has discussed the possible clinical impact that the fall in fine particle dose at lower flow 
rates (flow rates less than 60L/min) might have in patients with severe COPD (and severe asthma or 
other causes of severely impaired inspiratory capacity). The Applicant has included additional advice in 
the product information relating to training in optimal use of the device, to minimise any risk of 
underdosing as a consequence of low inspiratory flow rates. 
This product should not be used in the management of asthma in children and adolescents. This 
information is adequately reflected in the product information. In addition, it is included as missing 
information in the RMP. 
Based on the safety parameters measured in the pharmacokinetic studies carried out with FS Spiromax 
and presented in this submission, no safety concerns are observed.   
The adverse event profile is in line with the current knowledge on the safety pharmacology profiles of 
these two actives and is comparable with that of the reference product.

No clinically significant findings and no medically relevant events were observed with FS Spiromax. The 
safety profile is adequately reflected in the product information. 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on the clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetic equivalence between FS Spiromax and the reference product has been demonstrated. 
The lack of the submission of a full clinical efficacy programme is acceptable in this type of application 
and is in line with the CHMP Guideline for orally inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) 
providing that either in vitro equivalence and/or pharmacokinetic equivalence and/or 
pharmacodynamic therapeutic equivalence has been demonstrated.  In this application 
pharmacokinetic equivalence between FS Spiromax and the reference product both administered in 
one high strength, has been demonstrated. Hence, the absence of new pharmacodynamic and clinical 
studies is acceptable. 
In the light of the availability of only the high strength of FS Spiromax, the CHMP requested that the 
Applicant restrict the asthma indication to patients with severe asthma only. The Applicant agreed to 
this proposal.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of a fixed-dose combination of salmeterol xinafoate and 
fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The reference product Seretide Diskus forte, containing the 
same two active, is indicated for the treatment of asthma and COPD.  
Nonclinical studies have not been provided for this application and the review of the literature 
references is considered sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacodynamics or 
the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The lack of the submission of a full clinical efficacy 
programme is acceptable in this type of application and is in line with the CHMP Guideline for orally 
inhaled products (CHMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev. 1) providing that either in vitro equivalence and/or 
pharmacokinetic equivalence and/or pharmacodynamic therapeutic equivalence has been 
demonstrated. In this application pharmacokinetic equivalence between FS Spiromax and the reference 
product both administered in one high strength, has been demonstrated. Hence, the absence of new 
pharmacodynamic or clinical studies is acceptable. 
The design of the bioequivalence studies was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of 
this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of FS Spiromax met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Seretide Diskus. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the

parameters AUC0-t, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 0.8 to 
1.25. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
In the in vitro flow rate comparison conducted to investigate whether the flow rate dependence of the 
FS Spiromax device matched that of Seretide Accuhaler, lower fine particle dose is seen at the lower 
flow rates of 45 and 60L/min and lower total dose is seen at all four flow rates studied, 45, 60, 80 and 
100L/min for salmeterol xinafoate as measured with the Next Generation Impactor. These findings 
were discussed in the light of the pharmacokinetic data presented in healthy volunteers inhaling with 
flow rates in excess of 60L/min and in respect of the clinical relevance and impact of these findings in 
patients with severe COPD and severe asthma or other causes of severely impaired inspiratory 
capacity and inhaling with flow rates less than 60L/min. 
This difference is unlikely to contribute to differences in systemic exposure particularly when patients 
with asthma and patients with COPD are trained in the use of the Spiromax device in order to achieve 
inspiratory flow rates through the device of greater than 60L/min. As a consequence, additional advice 
was added to the product information relating to training in optimal use of the device, to minimise any 
risk of under dosing as a consequence of low inspiratory flow rates. 
FS Spiromax will be available in only one high strength. This single high strength will have no role in 
the initial treatment of patients with severe asthma unless the requirement for such a high dose of the 
corticosteroid together with a long-acting β2 agonist has been established previously and will have no 
role in the initial treatment of and maintenance of patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma. 
This single high strength of FS Spiromax will not allow down-titration of the inhaled corticosteroid 
component of the fixed-dose combination in patients in whom asthma is controlled on this single high 
strength, to a lower dose of corticosteroid at which control of symptoms would be maintained. 
Therefore, a restricted indication to patients with severe asthma only was granted. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Aerivio Spiromax: 
- 
for the regular treatment of patients with severe asthma where use of a combination product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: patients not adequately controlled 
on a lower strength corticosteroid combination product, or patients already controlled on a high 
dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist, 
- 
for the symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD, with a FEV1 <60% predicted normal (pre-
bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant symptoms despite 
regular bronchodilator therapy 
in adults aged 18 years and older only is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:
