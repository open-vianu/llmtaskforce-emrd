2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Melanoma is the sixth and seventh most common malignancy in men and women, respectively. The 
median age at diagnosis is 59 years. In Europe, approximately 26,100 males and 33,300 females are 
diagnosed annually with melanoma, and approximately 8,300 males and 7,600 females die from the 
disease every year. The outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation. When detected 
early and treated with adequate surgery, the prognosis of localized disease (thin lesions <1.0 mm 
without adverse prognostic features) is excellent with greater than 90% survival. However, for patients 
with unresectable or metastatic disease, the prognosis remains poor: the 1 year survival rate is 25.5% 
and 5-year survival rate is lower than 15%. 
In EU Countries, dacarbazine has been used as standard first line treatment of patients with metastatic 
melanoma1. Clinical trials with dacarbazine have shown low response rates ranging from 11% -25%, 
low rate of complete responses and of short duration (3 to 6 months). The median survival time 
ranged from 4.5 to 6 months2, 3,4. Ipilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, was 
recently approved in the EU for melanoma patients who have received prior therapy. In recent times,  
the serine-threonine kinase BRAF, was discovered mutated in many cancers5. BRAF mutations have 
been found in approximately 50% of melanoma, 30-70% of thyroid carcinomas, 30% of ovarian 
carcinoma and 10% of colorectal carcinoma. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF result in constitutive 
activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway which in turn stimulates cell growth, proliferation and cell 
survival in the absence of typical growth factors6. Oncogenic BRAF phosphorylates and activates MEK 
which in turn phosphorylates ERK (pERK), and pERK translocates into the nucleus where it activates 
transcriptional factors that are responsible for stimulating cell proliferation and cell survival (Figure 1).

RAF-MEK-ERK kinase signalling pathway ultimately leading to proliferation

The most frequently observed BRAF mutation in melanoma was shown to be V600E (74-90%). 
followed by V600K (15-25% of V600 mutations), V600R and V600D. Other more rare mutations (i.e. 
V600A, V600M and V600G) have also been described. Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally 
available, inhibitor of the activated form of oncogenic BRAF. It suppresses downstream signalling 
through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Since vemurafenib targets inhibition of 
oncogenic BRAF V600E, only patients whose tumours tested positive for BRAFV600E mutations by a 
companion diagnostic test (i.e., the cobas 4800 BRAF V600E Mutation Test) were considered eligible 
for enrolment into vemurafenib clinical trials.  
The Applicant was seeking an accelerated approval for vemurafenib (Zelboraf), for the treatment of 
melanoma patients harbouring BRAF V600 mutations, which represents a significant subgroup of the 
population treated in clinical practice. The CHMP agreed that at the time of submission, there was an 
unmet medical need with regards to medicinal products that could prolong overall survival in 
melanoma patients and that the product could change clinical practice in the EU and thus was of major 
interest from the view of public health and therapeutic innovation. Thus, The CHMP granted 
accelerated assessment for Zelboraf. 
The recommended dose of vemurafenib is 960 mg (4 tablets of 240 mg) twice daily (equivalent to a 
total daily dose of 1,920 mg). The first dose is to be taken in the morning and the second dose is to be 
taken approximately 12 hours later in the evening. Vemurafenib tablets are to be swallowed whole 
with water. Vemurafenib tablets should not be chewed or crushed.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Zelboraf is presented as film-coated tablets containing 240 mg of amorphous vemurafenib as active 
substance packaged in standard aluminium/aluminium blisters. The excipients used in the tablet core 
are colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropylcellulose, and magnesium 
stearate. They comply with their respective compendial monographs of the Ph Eur. The use of the 
excipients in the formulation has been justified and their functions explained. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The drug substance, vemurafenib, is a new chemical entity. It is manufactured as the amorphous form 
and processed with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMC-AS) in a ratio of 3:7 
(w:w). This is performed in order to keep the active moiety as the desired amorphous modification so 
as to achieve enhanced dissolution of the substance. 
The chemical name of vemurafenib is Propane-1-sulfonic acid {3-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-
b]pyridine-3-carbonyl]-2,4-difluoro- phenyl}-amide. 
 
 
The chemical structure of vemurafenib has been verified by elemental analysis (C, H, N, S, Cl, S, F, O), 
UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectroscopy and X-ray powder 
diffraction spectroscopy. 
Vemurafenib can exist as several polymorphs and solvates. The crystalline Form II is 
thermodynamically the most stable.  
Crystalline vemurafenib (Form II) is a white to almost white non-hygroscopic powder with a melting 
point of about 271C. Its solubility in water is very low (<0.0001 mg/ml) and it is not appreciably 
soluble in many common organic solvents either.  
When processed with HPMC-AS, vemurafenib becomes an amorphous white to almost white powder 
which is slightly hygroscopic. The product with (HPMC-AS) is non-crystalline. 
Manufacture 
The synthesis process of the active substance vemurafenib (HPMC-AS) involves six different steps, the 
first four of which comprise the formation of the active moiety vemurafenib, and then the other two 
complete the formation of vemurafenib with HPMC-AS. The manufacturing process has been suitably 
described in flow charts and a narrative description. In the synthesis process, five intermediates are 
isolated. 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 10/103
 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 11/103
 
The starting materials are controlled to justified and acceptable specifications. Descriptions of the 
synthesis routes of the starting materials have been enclosed. The analytical methods used in the 
control of the starting materials have been validated as applicable.   
The specified impurities are common in the active moiety, vemurafenib, and in vemurafenib/HPMC-AS 
formulation, and they are controlled at the same level. The analytical methods used in the control of 
the intermediates have been enclosed and they have been satisfactorily validated.  
Specification 
The specifications of the active substance contains tests with suitable limits for appearance (visual), 
Identification (IR and HPLC), water (Ph Eur), microbiological purity (Ph Eur), residual solvents (GC), 
assay (HPLC), heavy metals (dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry), particle size (laser 
diffraction), sulphated ash (Ph Eur)  and impurities (HPLC). The Applicant has provided a toxicological 
justification for the proposed levels of impurities.   
To verify the non-crystalline modification of the drug substance, X-ray powder diffraction analysis is 
performed. The diffraction pattern of the sample is compared with the patterns of the amorphous 
vemurafenib/HPMC-AS and crystalline vemurafenib Form II reference materials (the vemurafenib 
Form II is mixed with HPMC-AS in a ratio of 30:70).  
Stability 
Primary stability studies according to ICH guidelines have been initiated on pilot and commercial scale 
batches of the drug substance stored in the commercial package. Six months of accelerated data are 
available for all batches and up to 24 months of data have been reported for the long term condition. 
The parameters tested included assay, purity, related substances, appearance, colour, water content, 
HPLC identity, particle size distribution and amorphous modification. All results reported are within 
proposed specifications.  
The amorphous modification remains stable in all cases both at the accelerated and the long term 
condition. No change in appearance/colour or in particle size distribution is observed over time. The 
assay values remain stable and there is no decrease in purity with time at either condition.  
The drug substance has also been subjected to forced degradation both in the solid state and in 
solution/suspension. Light exposure brings about an increase in the hydroxymethyl impurity 
RO6808065 and the same impurity increased after treatment at forced degradation for 14 days. In 
solution/suspension, treatment with dilute hydrogen peroxide for 14 days is stated to induce the 
formation of the N-oxide RO6800721. This impurity has, however, not been found under ICH 
conditions.  
The proposed re-test period with the storage conditions “Do not store above 30C. Store in closed 
containers protected from light and humidity” is considered acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The pharmaceutical development has been adequately described. Vemurafenib is a compound with low 
permeability and very low solubility and this has been taken into account in the development. The 
difficulties with crystalline vemurafenib as regards solubility and bioavailability have been acceptably 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 12/103
 
discussed, and the development towards a film-coated tablet comprising the amorphous substance in 
co-precipitation with HPMC-AS, has been well described and justified.  
To ensure good processing properties and satisfactory dissolution the drug substance is milled and 
controlled with respect to particle size distribution. The water content of the drug substance is also 
considered critical as well as the amorphous modification.  The manufacturing process has been 
developed to comprise a dry granulation and thereby avoiding water in the process. By this, formation 
of crystalline Form II is avoided during manufacturing. The dry granulation is performed by roller 
compaction and this operation was optimized.   
The first clinical trial was conducted on a capsule formulation with 100 mg and 300 mg micronized 
crystalline Form I of vemurafenib. Form I of vemurafenib gradually transformed to Form II and the 
bioavailability observed was low. The need for another formulation was acknowledged and the 
amorphous form was developed.  The amorphous form was found to be more soluble and bioavailable 
than the crystalline form and it was subsequently used in all clinical studies. The same 240 mg film-
coated tablet as developed for the clinical studies will also be used for the commercial tablet.  
The manufacturing process development has resulted in a robust manufacturing process for the 
finished product. Critical steps and attributes have been adequately addressed.   
Adventitious agents 
Not applicable.  
Manufacture of the product 
The film-coated tablets are manufactured by a standard process comprising blending, screening, dry 
granulation, tablet compression and film-coating. Critical steps have been identified and properly 
evaluated at the commercial scale.  
The reproducibility of the process has been suitably demonstrated. Formal validation will be performed 
post-approval on the first three consecutive commercial batches. An acceptable validation plan for this 
activity has been provided.   
Product specification 
The drug product is controlled by testing attributes relevant for this dosage form. The film-coated 
tablets are tested for appearance, identification by HPLC retention time and UV spectrum, water 
content (KF), dissolution, control of amorphous form (X-ray powder diffraction spectrometry), 
uniformity of dosage units(mass variation/ Ph Eur), assay (HPLC) and, degradation products (HPLC). 
The tablets comply with Ph Eur criteria for microbiological quality.  
The analytical methods used in the control of the drug product have been satisfactorily validated 
according to ICH guidelines where necessary. Batch analysis data in compliance with the specifications 
have been provided for six pilot and three production scale batches. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been initiated according to ICH guidelines on both pilot and production scale 
batches of the finished product packaged in its commercial Al/Al blister package. Six months of 
accelerated data are reported for the batches and up to 24 months of long term data are at hand for 
the pilot scale batches and nine months from the production scale batches. The batches are monitored 
for description, assay, degradation products, water content, modification, and dissolution.  No 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 13/103
 
significant changes or trends in any of the parameters have been seen so far in the primary stability 
studies and all data are within proposed specifications. No change in modification has been observed in 
any instance and no change in dissolution profiles is seen. No increase in water content is reported in 
any batch at any condition and the assay remains unchanged throughout. There is no observed 
increase in degradation products over time.  
Stressed testing (photo-stability, open storage at high temperature and high and low moisture) has 
also been conducted on batches of the finished product. Tablet powder has also been subjected to 
aqueous acid, alkaline and oxidative conditions. The results of the stressed studies show that the 
tablets are not sensitive to light. An environment of high moisture and temperature or high moisture 
alone brought about changes in the amorphous vemurafenib modification which gradually transformed 
to crystalline Form II at such conditions.  
The film-coated tablets have been proven stable in the proposed Al/Al blister package after 6 months 
at the accelerated condition and up to 24 months after long term ICH storage. So far no crystalline 
Form II of the drug substance has been detected.  
Based upon the stability data provided, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions are considered 
acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Zelboraf is adequately established. In general, satisfactory chemical and pharmaceutical 
documentation has been submitted for marketing authorization. There are no major deviations from EU 
and ICH requirements. 
Since the drug substance active moiety, vemurafenib, is practically insoluble in aqueous media 
(especially in crystalline form) and it has very low bioavailability.  To improve solubility and 
bioavailability the substance, in its amorphous form, has been processed with 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate. This process renders the vemurafenib amorphous. 
The amorphous form of vemurafenib is confirmed at release and during stability studies by X-ray 
diffraction spectrometry. Also, the water content is controlled to ensure that the amorphous form will 
be maintained in the substance. 
The development of the 240 mg vemurafenib film-coated tablets has been well described and has 
resulted in a finished product which consistently and reproducibly complies with its proposed 
specifications.  The excipients are commonly used in these types of formulations and comply with Ph. 
Eur. requirements. The packaging material is commonly used and well documented. The manufacturing 
process of the finished product has been adequately described. Stability tests indicate that the product 
under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the proposed shelf life. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
no unresolved quality issues. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable.

In vitro mechanistic studies 
The effect of vemurafenib on RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition was investigated in a panel of cancer 
cell lines, including melanoma cell lines expressing BRAFV600E, BRAFV600D, BRAFV600R, or BRAFWT. 
MEK and ERK phosphorylation (pMEK and pERK respectively) immunoassays were conducted to 
measure the levels of pMEK and pERK in various cancer cells treated with vemurafenib compared to 
vehicle control (Figure 2).  
 
Figure 2 
Cellular Effect of vemurafenib on downstream targets MEK and ERK 
phosphorylation in cancer cells expressing BRAFV600E, BRAFV600D, 
BRAFV600R mutant kinase and BRAFWT kinase 
 
 
In cells expressing mutated BRAF (Colo829,WM2664 and WM1341D), vemurafenib inhibited both pERK 
and pMEK in a dose dependent manner. However, cells expressing BRAF WT vemurafenib induced 
rather than inhibited ERK or MEK phosphorylation in the cells expressing BRAFWT, such as HCT116, 
CHL-1 and SK-MEL-2 cells.  
Cellular proliferation was assessed in a panel of cancer cell lines, including melanoma cell lines 
expressing BRAFV600E, BRAFV600D, BRAFV600R, BRAFV600K or cells that express BRAFWT and 
harbour RAS mutations following vemurafenib treatment. Results are shown in Table 1 and 2.

In vivo mechanistic studies 
The in vivo activity of vemurafenib was assessed in a mouse xenograft study in which BRAFV600E–
expressing LOX melanoma cells were implanted into the flank of female athymic NU-Foxn1nu nu/nu 
mice. Tumours were allowed to grow to a size of 100 mg, and daily administration of vemurafenib or 
vehicle control was initiated on Day 5 or 6 after implant and continued for 13 days. Results are shown 
in Figure 3.

To assess the in vivo selectivity of vemurafenib against BRAFWT compared to mutant BRAFV600E, 
vemurafenib was administrated to female nude mice bearing HCT116 xenograft tumours which 
expressed BRAFWT. Treatment with vemurafenib began after HCT116 cell implantation and animals 
were dosed twice daily for 18 days. No inhibition of tumour growth observed with the administration of 
100 mg/kg twice a day (bid) of vemurafenib in the HCT116 xenograft model which expressed only 
BRAFWT.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) has been reported in patients with metastatic melanoma 
and CRC treated with vemurafenib. Clinical findings indicate that cuSCC may be related to treatment 
with vemurafenib. In order to understand the potential mechanism by which vemurafenib treatment 
contributes to development of cuSCC, vemurafenib was tested in vivo in the A431 cuSCC xenograft 
model.  There was dose-dependent tumour growth stimulation of the xenograft tumours at doses 
higher than 25 mg/kg bid (Figure 5A). The optimal dose of 75 mg/kg bid of vemurafenib caused a 
103% induction of growth compared to the control (p=0.002). Immunohistochemistry showed staining 
of pERK only in the tumour samples treated with vemurafenib (75 mg/kg) as compared to the vehicle 
treated control group. Combination studies of vemurafenib and a MEK inhibitor, RO5068760, were 
performed to confirm inhibition of pERK. Results are shown in Figure 5B.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular system 
The applicant performed a number of in vitro (Study NOVA05-2468-RR1041083; Study WIL578008-
RR1040807; WIL578011-RR1080810) and in vivo (Study WIL578013-RR1040811; Studies 10164-
RR1025759 and 11260-RR1032862) studies to investigate the effect of vemurafenib on the 
cardiovascular system. 
Lower systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures were recorded for all treatment groups from 11 to 
12 hours post-dosing through termination of recordings. The NOAEL for vemurafenib was 1000 mg/kg 
(estimated Cmax = 42 μM, about half of the Cmax (~90 μM) observed in patients dosed at 960 mg 
bid). In the repeat-dose GLP toxicity studies in dogs, ECGs were evaluated for heart rate and

waveform intervals (PR, QRS, RR, QT, and QTc), all of which were qualitatively and quantitatively 
within normal limits (up to steady state Cmax = 91 μM, which is comparable to the Cmax (~90 μM) 
observed in patients dosed at 960 mg bid).  
Central Nervous System 
The applicant performed an in vivo study (Study WIL-30031-RR1026179) to investigate the effect of 
vemurafenib on the central nervous system. vemurafenib was administered as a single oral dose to 
male Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0, 30, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (corn oil formulation). Animals were 
observed twice daily for mortality and moribundity. The positive control, chlorpromazine, produced the 
expected cascade of CNS depression. The NOAEL of vemurafenib was 1000 mg/kg with an estimated 
Cmax of 160 μM.  
Respiratory System 
The applicant performed an in vivo study (Study WIL-30030-RR1026178) to investigate the effect of 
vemurafenib on the respiratory system. Vemurafenib was administered as a single oral dose to male 
Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 0, 30, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (corn oil formulation). The NOAEL of 
vemurafenib was found to be 1000 mg/kg with an estimated Cmax of 160 μM.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant presented PK data from over 40 studies, many of which related to the optimization of the 
vemurafenib formulation. Vemurafenib was analyzed in plasma from animals by several methods at 
different stages of development. In all methods, plasma was analyzed by protein precipitation followed 
by HPLC chromatography and analyte detection using positive ion electrospray tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). 
An overview of the most important pharmacokinetic parameters for comparison of rat, dog, rabbit and 
human is given in Table 3.

Absorption 
Single dose studies to determine pharmacokinetics were conducted in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and 
monkey. In all pre-clinical species, half-lifes were between 2 and 5 hours and the volume of 
distribution between 0.25 (12% CV) and 0.69 (39% CV) L/kg. Only after intraperitoneal (IP) 
administration in mice, the half-life was much longer (20.6 h). Compared with other species, rabbits 
showed higher plasma exposure levels with a longer mean terminal half-life between 12 and 18 hours.  
Two oral repeated dose studies have been conducted in both male and female dogs with twice-daily 
doses as MBP formulation of 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg for 37 days and with twice-daily doses of 75 and 
150 mg/kg for 92 days. In dogs, the bioavailability was 10% after oral administration of vemurafenib 
in Phase I formulation and ~40% in MBP formulations. No gender differences were observed in 
systemic exposure. AUC and Cmax were less than dose-proportional in both male and female dogs 
suggesting saturation of absorption.  
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding data was independent of the compound concentration (250-50000 ng/mL) for 
all species studied. The average percent plasma protein binding was 99.81± 0.07, 99.85 ± 0.06, 99.79 
± 0.09, 99.82 ± 0.10 and 99.86 ± 0.06 for mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively. 
Percent binding of 14C-vemurafenib to human serum albumin was 99.80 ± 0.13. The overall percent 
binding of 14C-vemurafenib to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein was 99.18 ± 0.23.  
The blood to plasma ratio for 14C-vemurafenib was 0.63 ± 0.03, 0.60 ± 0.04, 0.68 ± 0.04, 0.85 ± 
0.05 and 0.58 ± 0.03 for mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively. The overall percent of 
14C-vemurafenib associated with red blood cells was 15.42 ± 4.48, 15.23 ± 5.01, 20.04 ± 3.93, 39.88 
± 3.13, and 11.40 ± 3.75 for mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively.  
Concentrations of radioactivity in tissues were relatively similar to blood concentrations at all time 
points with concentrations present in almost all tissues at the earliest sampled time points (0.5 to 12 h 
post-dose), except for liver, kidney, adrenal cortex, lachrymal glands, lung, and alimentary canal 
tissues, which were generally higher than that in blood. High concentrations were observed in 
gastrointestinal contents (Cmax 92.694 to 6950.564 μg equiv/g) and bile (Cmax 91.437 μg equiv/g at 
4 h). Concentrations in tissues generally decreased over the course of the study and most tissues (39 
out of 43) were below the limit of quantisation (BLQ) by 24 hours post dose, except for the small 
intestine, skin, pancreas, liver, and stomach. Selective distribution and retention in melanin-containing 
tissues of the eye (uveal tract) or skin was not detected. Concentrations in the brain and spinal cord 
were BQL throughout the duration of the study. Elimination appeared to be complete at 96 h post-
dose.  
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism was analyzed for rat, mouse, dog, cynomolgus and human. The metabolism of 
vemurafenib was investigated both in vitro using microsomes and hepatocytes of various species and 
in vivo in rat, dog and human.  In vitro analysis of vemurafenib metabolism in liver hepatocytes at the 
concentration of 10 uM, humans, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys did not metabolize vemurafenib 
extensively (unchanged vemurafenib ≥ 89%). 
Metabolic schematics are presented in Figure 6.  
Figure 6 
Biotransformation pattern in humans 
 
 
 
 
The results from in vitro studies indicate that CYP3A4 was the major enzyme responsible in the 
metabolism of vemurafenib. The formation of mono-hydroxyl metabolites were inhibited for ~82% 
using the CYP inhibitor ketoconazole. No significant inhibition in the metabolism was observed in 
human liver microsomes in the presence of quinidine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9 
inhibitor), tranylcypromine (CYP2A6 inhibitor) and (-)-N-3-benzyl-phenobarbital (CYP2C19 inhibitor). 
In addition, CYP3A4 was responsible for the formation of the mono-hydroxylation metabolites. 
Metabolic profiles were evaluated in vivo in rat (plasma and excreta), dog (plasma) and humans 
(plasma and excreta) and are shown in Table 4.

Excretion 
The major route of elimination in rats was biliary excretion since 98.1% of 14C-labeled vemurafenib 
(MBP formulation) was recovered in feces. In an extended mass balance study a single intravenous or 
oral administration of [14C]-vemurafenib to naïve (without bile duct cannulation) or bile duct 
cannulated rats, the elimination of absorbed radioactivity was primarily hepatic. In naïve rats, the 
amount of radioactivity recovered in the feces was approximately 45- and 842-fold higher than that 
recovered in the urine after an intravenous and oral dose, respectively. In animals with implanted bile 
duct catheters, the amount of administered radioactivity recovered in the bile was approximately 25- 
and 58-fold higher than that recovered in the urine following intravenous and oral dose, respectively. 
Elimination of total radioactivity was not complete at 24 hours post dose in both naïve rats or animals 
with implanted bile duct catheters.

Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Vemurafenib absorbed UV light significantly between 240 nm and 450 nm. Therefore, vemurafenib was 
assessed for possible phototoxic potential in vitro by the 3T3 fibroblast Neutral Red uptake assay. 
Vemurafenib was tested at concentrations ranging from 0.004 to 9.000 µg/mL. Absorption was 
measured at 540 nm. IC50 was determined to be >9 µg/mL for the non-irradiated (DARK) cytotoxicity 
control and 0.197 µg/mL for UVA irradiated cells. The DARK/UVA photoirritation factor for phototoxicity 
was determined to be 45.6. Applying the threshold photoirritation factor value of 5 (determined in 
validation studies for predicting in vivo activity), vemurafenib was shown to be phototoxic in vitro in 
cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA irradiation. 
Phototoxicity of vemurafenib was assessed in vivo in the hairless rat study. Vemurafenib (MBP 
formulation) was administered orally by gavage to female hairless rats (6/group) at 0, 30, 150 or 450 
mg/kg/day for 7 days. Vemurafenib did not appear to induce phototoxic skin reactions up to 450 
mg/kg/day in animal models.

Haemotoxicity 
An in vitro bone marrow cytotoxicity study was conducted to examine the potential for direct cytotoxic 
effect of vemurafenib on the bone marrow. Vemurafenib was tested at concentrations ranging from 
0.75 to 125 M, in 7 different lympho-hematopoietic cells from rat, dog, or human bone marrow. 
Inhibition of proliferation was observed at concentrations higher than 15.6 µM, 62.5 µM and 31.3 µM in 
human, dog and rat cells respectively.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment (ERA). Vemurafenib was shown not to be 
persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT/vPvB) for the environment. Risks to the sediment and soil 
compartment were deemed acceptable. For surface water, groundwater and the STP, a direct risk has 
not been demonstrated.  A summary of the main studies submitted for the ERA are shown in Table 9.

2.3.6.   Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of BRAF serine-threonine kinase. 
Mutations in the BRAF gene which substitute the valine at amino acid position 600 result in 
constitutively activated BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth 
factors that would normally be required for proliferation.  
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 28/103
 
Preclinical data generated in biochemical assays demonstrated that vemurafenib can potently inhibit 
BRAF kinases with activating codon 600 mutations.  
The inhibitory effect of vemurafenib on activated mutated BRAF was confirmed in the ERK 
phosphorylation and cellular anti-proliferation assays in available melanoma cell lines expressing V600-
mutant BRAF. In cellular anti-proliferation assays the IC50 against V600 mutated cell lines (V600E, 
V600R, V600D and V600K mutated cell lines) ranged from 0.016 to 1.131 M whereas the inhibitory 
concentration 50 against BRAF wild type cell lines were 12.06 and 14.32 M, respectively. Vemurafenib 
was also found to inhibit activity of other kinases including RAF1, ARAF, BRK(PTK6), SRMS and ACK1.  
BRAFWT cell lines treated with vemurafenib showed a dose-response increase in phosphorylation of 
ERK and MEK. This is an important finding as it may provide on one hand a hypothetical mechanism for 
the increase rate of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) which has been observed in clinical 
studies with vemurafenib and on the other hand a possible mechanism for acquired resistance. It has 
been speculated that upregulation of pERK might be a potential mechanism by which vemurafenib 
stimulates tumour growth in the A431 cuSCC model. 
The preclinical safety profile of vemurafenib was assessed in rats, dogs, and rabbits. The non-clinical 
studies submitted were considered acceptable.  
Repeat-dose toxicology studies identified the liver and bone marrow as target organs in the dog. 
Reversible toxic effects (hepatocellular necrosis and degeneration) in the liver at exposures below the 
anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparisons) were noted in the 13-week dog study. Focal 
bone marrow necrosis was noted in one dog in a prematurely terminated 39-week BID dog study at 
exposures similar to the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC comparisons). In an in vitro bone 
marrow cytotoxicity study, slight cytotoxicity was observed in some lympho-hematopoietic cell 
populations of rat, dog and human at clinically relevant concentrations. 
There were no safety signals observed in the in vivo safety pharmacology core battery studies 
performed in dog and rat.   
No specific studies with vemurafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. 
However, in repeat-dose toxicity studies, no histopathological findings were noted on reproductive 
organs in males and females in rats and dogs at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (at exposures below the 
anticipated clinical exposure based on AUC comparison). No teratogenicity was observed in 
embryofoetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to respectively 250 mg/kg/day and 
450 mg/kg/day leading to exposures below the anticipated clinical exposure (based on AUC 
comparison). However, exposures in the embryofoetal development studies were below the clinical 
exposure based on AUC comparison, it is therefore difficult to define to what extent these results can 
be extrapolated to humans. Therefore an effect of vemurafenib on the foetus cannot be excluded. No 
studies were performed regarding pre- and postnatal development. 
No signs of genotoxicity were identified in in vitro assays (bacterial mutation [AMES Assay], human 
lymphocyte chromosome aberration) nor in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test conducted 
with vemurafenib.  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with vemurafenib. The lack of carcinogenic studies 
was acceptable since anti-neoplastic agents intended for treatment of advanced systemic disease do 
not generally need carcinogenicity studies according to current guidelines, ICH S1A and ICH S9 
guideline. 
Vemurafenib was shown to be phototoxic, in vitro, on cultured murine fibroblasts after UVA irradiation, 
but not in vivo in a rat study at doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (at exposures below the anticipated clinical 
exposure (based on AUC comparison).  It is hypothesized that in the 7-day rat study, vemurafenib did

not reach the skin in a sufficient quantity to elicit a phototoxic response. The CHMP considered that the 
documentation was satisfactory and the photosensitivity signal was included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC. 
The data presented by the applicant showed no direct toxicity against lympho-hematopoietic cells from 
the three different species tested.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for vemurafenib were 
considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects for the product 
vemurafenib. The lack of carcinogenicity studies was justified and considered acceptable. 
The CHMP requested to resolve some minor issues with regards to the consequences of the differences 
in organ distribution between animals and human and the extrapolation of the findings to humans and 
possibility of liver toxicity due to reactive metabolites. The CHMP requested the applicant to perform in 
vitro studies addressing this issue. These issues are covered in the RMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01XE15  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Using the criteria described in the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, vemurafenib was classified 
as a Class IV drug (low solubility and low permeability). 
Vemurafenib is a Class IV substance (low solubility and permeability), using the criteria described in 
the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. The pharmacokinetic parameters for vemurafenib were 
determined using non compartmental analysis in a phase I and phase III studies (20 patients after 15 
days of dosing at 960 mg twice daily, and 204 patients in steady state day 22) as well as by population 
PK analysis using pooled data from 458 patients. Among these patients, 457 were Caucasians.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

 
Bioavailability 
An absolute bioavailability study was not performed. Due to the limited solubility of vemurafenib at 
physiological pH 6.8, (0.01-0.10 µg/ml),  it was not possible to formulate standard doses as an 
intravenous formulation.  
 
Influence of food 
An attempt to evaluate the effect of concomitant food on vemurafenib bioavailability was made in a 
substudy within Study PLX06-02. However, the substudy failed because of insufficient number of 
patients. A dedicated food effect study (NP25396) has been initiated with the final tablet formulation. 
Distribution 
As absolute bioavailability, F, is unknown, volume of distribution could only be estimated. In Study 
NP25163, the elimination rate constant Kel for the 960 mg dose was calculated to be 0.020/h with an 
estimated AUCtau = AUC0-12h of 600 µg*h/mL. From these data, Vd/F (Dose/[AUC0-tau x kel]) was 
estimated from steady-state values to be approximately 80 L. 
The volume of distribution, based on the final population-PK model, was 91 l, with a between patient 
variability of 64.8%. Blood/plasma ratio for vemurafenib was 0.58, and was independent of 
vemurafenib concentration. In the mass-balance study NP25158, blood/plasma ratio for total 
radioactivity was 0.72 ± 0.05 (range, 0.69 to 0.81). 
Elimination 
The elimination rate constant and elimination half-life across the four dose cohorts in study NP25163 
(240 mg to 960 mg bid) were assessed by the use of a 7-day drug interruption period after 15 days of 
dosing. The mean elimination half-life values were 31.5, 38.4, 34.9 and 34.1 hours for the 240, 480, 
720 and 960 mg bid doses, respectively. Analysis of mean trough data following vemurafenib dose 
interruption indicates that 95% of the drug was cleared from the body in 7 days.  
 
Excretion 
Mass-balance study 
In study NP25158, identification of vemurafenib and metabolites in plasma, faeces and urine was made 
for the first 96 hr, with a total collection period of 432 hrs (18 days).  
Mean data from the 7 patients indicated that over the period investigated (0 to 96 hours), potential 
metabolites each accounted for < 0.5% of the total administered dose in urine and ≤6% of the total 
administered dose in faeces. In pooled faecal samples up to 48 hours post post-dose, parent 
compound accounted for at least 94% of total radioactivity (37% of the dose). 
In faecal samples taken 48-96 hr post-dose, the amount of metabolites increased, with M6, M3, and 
M8 representing approximately 19%, 14% and 12%, of the total chromatographic peak area, 
respectively (mean values) or 3%, 5% and 4% of the dose, respectively. Over the 0-96 hr collection 
period, potential metabolites M3 (mono-hydroxy) and M6 (glucosylation) each accounted for <0.5% of 
the total administered dose in urine. Vemurafenib accounted for approximately 1% of the total dose in 
urine.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, mean values for Cmax and Cmin at steady state after 
960 mg BID dosing were 63.8 µg/ml and 61.0 µg/ml, respectively.

A dose escalation study, NP25163, was performed to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of single- 
and multiple dose vemurafenib across the therapeutic dose range with the final 240 mg film-coated 
tablet for BID administration (Table 11 and 12).

A comparison of vemurafenib pharmacokinetic parameters on Day 1 and Day 15 in the Phase 2 Study 
NP22657 and the 960 mg bid cohort in Study NP25163 is shown in Table 13. The ratio between the 
mean values on Day 15 and Day 1 from both studies ranged from 15- to 17-fold for AUC0-8h, and 13- 
to 14-fold for Cmax (Table 17).

Intra and Inter- variability 
Across studies NP25163, NP22657, and NP22676, the inter-patient variability (CV%) for both AUC and 
Cmax at Day 1 (single dose) and Day 15 (multiple doses) were between 57.6% to 69.9% and 27.9% 
to 38.4%, respectively. 
– 
Tumour size change with treatment 
In a population PK/PD analysis, relationship between vemurafenib exposure and tumour size change 
from baseline, was investigated. There were three exposure categories of mean AUC that were 
defined: low, medium, and high. Significant reductions in tumour size over time were observed in all 
exposure categories. However, the percentage of patients with a positive increase in tumour size from 
baseline at the end of treatment was higher (22%) in the low exposure category than in the medium 
and high exposure categories (11% and 9%, respectively) (Figure 14).

Special populations 
The covariate “gender” was found to statistically influence the CL/F and the V/F, with a 17% greater 
CL/F and a 48% greater V/F in male patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Mean 
vemurafenib exposure (AUC0-8h on Day 15) was approximately 42% higher in female than male 
patients. 
Body weight and age was not a statistically significant co-variate in the population PK analysis.  
The applicant did not submit studies in children.

There were no studies submitted in renal impaired patients and in hepatic impaired patients. 
There were no pharmacokinetic data submitted in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Vemurafenib concentrations up to 50 μM were used in PK interaction studies. The results showed that 
vemurafenib has a potential to inhibit the activity of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and 
CYP3A4/5, the IC50 were 5.9 μM, 33.2 μM, 32.5 μM and 22.5 μM, respectively. For CYP2A6, 2E1 and 
3A4 no significant inhibition was seen at concentrations up to 50 μM. No time-dependent irreversible 
inhibition of CYP3A4 was detected (24 minutes pre-incubation).   
Vemurafenib did not induce CYP3A4/5 activity at concentrations up to 10 μM in in vitro induction 
studies using human hepatocytes. 
In vitro results showed that vemurafenib is a weak P-gp substrate. The calculated IC50 was 17 and 3.5 
μM for digoxin and quinidine, respectively. The efflux ratio was decreased from 5.0 at 10 μM to 1.8 and 
1.1 at 25 and 50 μM, respectively. 
Vemurafenib was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (Study 11707-
RR1041536) up to a concentration of 50 µM. 
The effect of vemurafenib on several CYP enzymes is summarised in Table 15.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The applicant did not submit clinical studies on mechanism of action. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The applicant investigated the dependence of time-matched QTcP changes from baseline on 
vemurafenib concentrations. The results are shown in Figure 8. 
Figure 8 
Relationship between vemurafenib concentration and Observed QTcP 
 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Vemurafenib is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class IV drug (low solubility and 
permeability). The applicant did not conduct an absolute bioavailability study. This was considered 
acceptable since vemurafenib has low solubility in physiological solutions of pH 6.8 (0.01-0.10 µg/mL). 
Given the risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, it was also considered acceptable that 
volunteers were not used in any of the Pk/PD studies.   
The effect of food on absorption of vemurafenib is currently unknown. Variability in exposure may 
occur due to differences in gastro-intestinal fluid content, volumes, pH, motility and transition time and 
bile composition. 
At steady state, the mean vemurafenib exposure in plasma is stable during the 24-hour interval as 
indicated by the mean ratio of 1.13 between the plasma concentrations before and 2-4 hours after the 
morning dose.  
Following oral dosing, the absorption rate constant for the population of metastatic melanoma patients 
is estimated to be 0.19 hr-1 (with 101% between patient variability).

CHMP assessment report

Page 39/103
 
A dedicated food effect study was not performed during the clinical development. The lack of food 
effect data was accepted as the clinical benefit had been demonstrated. The CHMP requested the 
applicant to submit the data from the ongoing food effect study NP25396 to further study the 
association between concomitant intake of food may and the absorption of vemurafenib. This post-
authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. The current recommendation in the SmPC is that each 
dose in the morning/evening should always be taken in the same manner i.e. either with or without a 
meal (SmPC section 4.2).   
Relationship between vemurafenib exposure and tumour size change from baseline was investigated. 
The CHMP highlighted that the risk of underexposure to vemurafenib could affect reduction of tumour 
size and, as a consequence, decrease efficacy. The CHMP requested the applicant to perform a study to 
analyse patients that may have low exposure. The study has been included in the RMP and will be 
covered by the ongoing food effect study NP25396 with results expected by June 2012. 
Vemurafenib is highly protein bound (>99%) and appears to be a Pgp substrate but is not a substrate 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The CHMP requested the applicant to perform an interaction study with 
digoxin (see further in the conclusions). This post-authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. 
The absolute bioavailability of the vemurafenib 240 mg tablet is unknown. 
Vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily is absorbed with a median Tmax of approximately 4 hours. 
Vemurafenib exhibits high inter-patient variability. In the phase II study, AUC0-8h and Cmax at day 1 
were 22.1 ± 12.7 µgh/mL and 4.1 ± 2.3 µg/mL. Accumulation occurs upon multiple twice daily dosing 
of vemurafenib. In the non compartmental analysis, after dosing with 960 mg vemurafenib twice daily 
the Day 15 / Day 1 ratio ranged from 15- to 17-fold for AUC, and 13- to 14-fold for Cmax, yielding 
AUC0-8h and Cmax of 380.2 ± 143.6 µgh/mL and 56.7 ± 21.8 µg/mL, respectively, under steady-state 
conditions. 
Vemurafenib is the major circulating compound in plasma, accounting for 95% of the drug-related 
material. 
The population apparent volume of distribution for vemurafenib in metastatic melanoma patients is 
estimated to be 91 L (with 64.8% between patient variability). It is highly bound to human plasma 
proteins in vitro (>99%).  
The relative proportions of vemurafenib and its metabolites were characterized in a human mass 
balance study with a single dose of 14C-labeled vemurafenib administered orally. CYP3A4 is the primary 
enzyme responsible for the metabolism of vemurafenib in vitro. Conjugation metabolites 
(glucuronidation and glycosylation) were also identified in humans. However, the parent compound 
was the predominant component (95%) in plasma. Although metabolism does not appear to result in a 
relevant amount of metabolites in plasma, the importance of metabolism for excretion cannot be 
excluded.  
Elimination of vemurafenib is slow and population pharmacokinetic data indicate a half-life of 
approximately 50 hr. With twice daily dosing (BID), accumulation of the parent compound is large, 
about 20 to 25-fold, and there is virtually no fluctuation in plasma concentrations over the dosing 
interval at steady state. Pharmacokinetic data for up to 15 days indicate that steady state is not 
reached in all patients on Day 15. It will also take more than two weeks to washout the substance after 
cessation of treatment, or to have full effect of a potential dose adjustment. Accordingly management 
of symptomatic adverse drug reactions or QTc prolongation may require dose reduction, temporary 
interruption and/or treatment discontinuation (see table 16). Posology adjustments resulting in a dose 
below 480 mg twice daily are not recommended. These recommendations are reflected in the SmPC. 
 
In the event the patient develops Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cuSCC), it is recommended to 
continue the treatment without modifying the dose of vemurafenib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC).

The population apparent clearance of vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma is estimated 
to be 29.3 L/day (with 31.9% between patient variability). The population elimination half-life 
estimated by the population PK analysis for vemurafenib is 51.6 hours (the 5th and 95th percentile 
range of the individual half life estimates is 29.8 - 119.5 hours).

In the human mass balance study with p.o.vemurafenib administered orally vemurafenib, on average 
95% of the dose was recovered within 18 days. The majority of vemurafenib-related material (94%) 
was recovered in faeces, and <1% in urine. Biliary excretion of unchanged compound may be an 
important route of elimination. However, due to the unknown absolute bioavailability, the importance 
of hepatic and renal excretion for the clearance of parent vemurafenib is uncertain.  
The majority of drug-related material was excreted in faeces. Without absolute bioavailability data, the 
relative importance of metabolism vs. biliary excretion of unchanged parent compound cannot be 
definitely concluded. The CHMP as recommended that the applicant performs an absolute 
bioavailability study to gather more information on the metabolism and biliary excretion of 
vemurafenib. However, based on the available data, biliary excretion could account for about 60% of 
the elimination and metabolism for 40%. The metabolism appears to be primarily via three, 
approximately equally important pathways: CYP3A4, glucuronidation (UGT not identified) and 
glucosylation.  
Elderly  
Based on the population PK analysis, age has no statistically significant effect on vemurafenib 
pharmacokinetics. 
Gender 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated a 17% greater apparent clearance (CL/F) and a 
48% greater apparent volume of distribution (V/F) in males than in females.  It is unclear whether this 
is a gender or a body size effect. However, the differences in exposure are not large enough to warrant 
dose adjustment based on body size or gender. 
Paediatric population 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib in paediatric 
patients. 
Renal impairment 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with metastatic 
melanoma, mild and moderate renal impairment did not influence the apparent clearance of 
vemurafenib (creatinine clearance >40 ml/min). There are no data in patients with severe renal 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). There was no study in renal impaired patients submitted with 
the application. Although renal excretion is likely to be of minor importance for the elimination of 
vemurafenib, patients with severe renal impairment who are not on dialysis may be at risk of increased 
levels of urinary toxins that could have the potential to inhibit certain transporters. A warning has been 
included in the SmPC in section 4.4 that limited data are available in patients with renal impairment. A 
risk for increased exposure in patients with severe renal impairment cannot be excluded. Patients with 
severe renal impairment should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
Based on preclinical data and the human mass balance study, major part of vemurafenib is eliminated 
via the liver. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis using data from clinical trials in patients with 
metastatic melanoma, increases in AST and ALT up to three times the upper limit of normal did not 
influence the apparent clearance of vemurafenib. Data are insufficient to determine the effect of 
metabolic or excretory hepatic impairment on vemurafenib pharmacokinetics (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). There was no study in hepatic impaired patients submitted with the application. A warning has 
been included in the SmPC to the effect that limited data are available in patients with hepatic 
impairment. As vemurafenib is cleared by the liver, patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report

impairment may have increased exposure and should be closely monitored (see sections 4.4 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC). The CHMP requested the applicant to perform a study on severe hepatic impaired patients. 
This post-authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. 
The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib has not been yet established in children and adolescents 
(<18 years). No data are available. 
The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib has not been established in non-Caucasian patients. No data 
are available. 
Effects of vemurafenib on CYP substrates 
CYP1A2 inhibition was observed when a single dose of caffeine was co-administered after repeat 
dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days. This resulted in an average 2.5-fold increase (maximum up to 
10-fold) in caffeine plasma exposure after vemurafenib treatment. Vemurafenib may increase the 
plasma exposure of substances predominantly metabolized by CYP1A2 and dose adjustments should be 
considered. 
CYP3A4 induction was observed when a single dose of midazolam was co-administered after repeat 
dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days. This resulted in an average 32% decrease (maximum up to 
80%) in midazolam plasma exposure after vemurafenib treatment. Vemurafenib may decrease the 
plasma exposure of substances predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. On this basis, the efficacy of 
contraceptive pills metabolized by CYP3A4 used concomitantly with vemurafenib might be decreased. 
Dose adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic window should be considered (see 
section 4.4 and 4.6). 
Mild induction of CYP2B6 by vemurafenib was noted in vitro at a vemurafenib concentration of 10 µM. 
It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib at a plasma level of 100 µM observed in patients at 
steady state (approximately 50 µg/ml) may decrease plasma concentrations of concomitantly 
administered CYP2B6 substrates, such as bupropion. The CHMP requested the applicant to perform in 
vitro studies for inhibition of CYP 2A6, 2E1, 2C8 and 2B6. This is currently adequately addressed in the 
SmPC. This post-authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. 
When a single dose of warfarin was co-administered after repeat dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days, 
some patients exhibited increased warfarin exposure (mean 20%) (see section 4.4). Caution should be 
exercised when vemurafenib is co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9) in patients with melanoma. 
Due to the long half-life of vemurafenib, the full inhibitory effect of vemurafenib on a concomitant 
medicinal product medication might not be observed before 8 days of vemurafenib treatment.  
After cessation of vemurafenib treatment, a washout of 8 days might be necessary to avoid an 
interaction with a subsequent treatment.  
Effects of vemurafenib on substance transport systems 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter (P-gp).  
The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. It cannot be excluded that vemurafenib may increase 
the exposure of other medicines transported by P-gp. 
The possible effect of vemurafenib on other transporters (e.g. BCRP) is currently unknown. 
Effects of concomitant medicines on vemurafenib 
In vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 metabolism and glucuronidation are responsible for the 
metabolism of vemurafenib. Biliary excretion appears to be another important elimination pathway. 
There are no clinical data available showing the effect of strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 43/103
 
transport protein activity on vemurafenib exposure. Vemurafenib should be used with caution in 
combination with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, glucuronidation and/or transport proteins (e.g. ritonavir, 
saquinavir, telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, 
atazanavir).   
Concomitant administration of potent inducers of P-gp, glucuronidation, and/or CYP3A4 (e.g. 
rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s Wort [hypericum perforatum]) may lead to 
supoptimal exposure to vemurafenib and should be avoided. The CHMP requested the applicant to 
perform an interaction study with rifampicin and ketoconazole. This is currently adequately addressed 
in the SmPC. This post-authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib is a substrate of the efflux transporter, P-gp. The 
effects of P-gp inducers and inhibitors on vemurafenib exposure are unknown. It cannot be excluded 
that vemurafenib pharmacokinetics could be affected by medicines that inhibit or influence P-gp (e.g. 
verapamil, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, dronedarone, amiodarone, itraconazole, 
ranolazine). The CHMP requested the applicant to perform an in vitro characterisation study on 
transport proteins. This is currently adequately addressed in the SmPC. This post-authorisation 
measure is covered in the RMP. 
It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib is a substrate also to other transport proteins.  
As elimination is primarily via CYP3A4 and vemurafenib appears to be a Pgp substrate, a combined 
CYP3A4 and Pgp inhibitor might therefore affect more than 70% of the elimination of vemurafenib. 
Induction of CYP3A4 by vemurafenib was seen with a mean 32% decrease in AUC of a CYP3A4 
substrate and with the largest individual effect of 80% decrease. This may be clinically relevant and 
further studies have been included in the RMP to address this risk.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the clinical pharmacology studies submitted by the applicant were 
adequate. There is some missing information on drug-drug interactions, the degree of CYP3A4 
metabolism and the effects of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on vemurafenib exposure. However, 
these issues have been adequately addressed in the SmPC with proper warnings and precautions of 
use and, in addition, the CHMP has requested the applicant to perform several studies to provide the 
missing information. There was missing information on the importance of hepatic and renal clearance. 
However, this was considered acceptable since it has been adequately covered in the SmPC and the 
RMP. The CHMP considered that the benefit risk balance was not affected by this missing information. 
There was uncertainty on the absolute bioavailability which hindered the interpretation of the mass 
balance study. The CHMP has recommended that the applicant perform an absolute bioavailability 
study. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Selection of the Phase III dose was based on nonclinical data and clinical efficacy and safety observed 
in the Phase 1 study, PLX06-02. 
The goal of the Phase 1 study was to use the highest dose of vemurafenib that could be tolerated in 
order to maximize the therapeutic index for metastatic melanoma. The dose escalation phase of 
PLX06-02 was based on a modified 3+3 accelerated-titration design. Briefly, 3-4 patients per dose 
were to be treated for 4 weeks, with dose increases of 50%-100% in the absence of dose limiting 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 44/103
 
toxicities. Up to 6 patients were to be treated if one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed at a 
given dose, and a dose was considered to be higher than the maximum tolerated dose if 2 or more 
DLTs were observed in the cohort of 6 patients. The dose range of 160 mg bid to 1120 mg bid was 
evaluated with the optimized MBP formulations. 
DLTs, primarily Grade 3 rash and Grade 3 fatigue, were observed in 4 patients at 1120 mg bid. 
Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose of 960 mg bid, representing the approximate midpoint 
between 720 mg bid and 1120 mg bid, was selected for further clinical development.

Study Participants  
A total of 680 patients were planned to be enrolled at centers in Western Europe, North America, 
Australia/New Zealand, and Israel. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment in a 1:1 
randomization ratio to one of two treatment arms. 
Treatments 
Patients were to receive continuous oral doses of vemurafenib 960 mg bid without scheduled dose 
interruption. Patients took four 240 mg tablets in the morning and four 240 mg tablets in the evening 
(960 mg bid for a total daily dose of 1920 mg). After 8 hours of fasting on pharmacokinetic collection 
days (Day 1 of Cycles 1-4, 6, 8, and 10 and Day 1 of all subsequent cycles), vemurafenib was 
administered to patients as part of the scheduled study visit in the clinic; patients then had 4 hours of 
post-dose fasting. If patients were unable to tolerate post-dose fasting on the morning of 
pharmacokinetic collection days, patients could have a light snack (i.e., crackers, toast, juice, and 
water) if needed. On days when dosing was administered at home, patients were not required to take 
their study treatment under fasting conditions. 
Dacarbazine was administered intravenously 1000 mg/m2 up to 60 minutes on Day 1 of every 3 weeks 
(3 weeks was one cycle length). Dosing could be given up to 2 days early or 7 days late. No fasting  as 
required for patients taking dacarbazine and pharmacokinetic samples were not obtained for these 
patients during the study. 
Patients were treated until the development of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, and/or 
consent withdrawal. 
The following medications and treatments were not allowed during the study treatment period: 
• Other anti-cancer therapies 
• Radiotherapy for the treatment of disease, with the exception of limited field radiotherapy for 
palliative bone pain because of a pre-existing bone metastasis (if it was not considered a target 
lesion for RECIST assessments) 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of vemurafenib as a monotherapy 
compared to dacarbazine in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in 
previously untreated patients with BRAFV600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 47/103
 
• To further assess the efficacy of vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine based on best overall 
response rate (BORR), time to response, and duration of response  
• To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of vemurafenib using the NCI CTCAE (version 
4.0) 
• To further characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of vemurafenib 
• To contribute to the validation of the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test as a companion 
diagnostic test for the detection of BRAFV600 mutations in DNA extracted from formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded tumour (FFPET) samples 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There were two co-primary efficacy endpoints for this study: OS and PFS. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were BORR (RECIST v1.1), duration of response and time to 
response. 
Tumour assessments were done at screening, every 6 weeks for the first 12 weeks, every 9 weeks 
subsequently, and at the final visit. Patients were followed for AEs (with exception of SCC) up to 28 
days after the last dose in all patients. All SCC events occurring at any time during the study or follow-
up period (every 3 months until patient death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up) were 
collected and reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) to the sponsor. 
OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. For patients who were alive 
at the time of analysis data cut-off, OS time was censored at the last date the patient was known to be 
alive prior to the clinical cut-off date. The last date the patient was known to be alive was derived as 
the latest date of contact or study assessment.  
The final analysis for PFS was performed at the time of the interim efficacy analysis for OS. PFS was 
defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression (based on tumour 
assessment date) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. The death of a patient without a 
reported progression was considered as an event on the date of death. Patients who had neither 
progressed nor died were censored on the date of last evaluable tumour assessment prior to the 
clinical cut-off date. PFS for patients who had no post-baseline assessment and who did not have an 
event were censored on the date of randomization. There was no blinded independent central review of 
PFS. 
Duration of response was evaluated for patients who satisfied the criteria for BORR (confirmed).  
Sample size 
Approximately 680 patients were planned to be randomized (1:1) to receive either vemurafenib (Arm 
A) or dacarbazine (DTIC) (Arm B). 
For OS, a total of 196 deaths (100% information), at an accrual of 41 patients per month, provided 
80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 for death for vemurafenib treatment relative to 
dacarbazine treatment, under the following assumptions: 0.045 significance level (two-sided), median 
survival of 8 months in the dacarbazine arm and 12.3 months in the vemurafenib arm. 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 48/103
 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed using an interactive voice recognition system (IVRS). Following the 
screening period (of up to 28 days), eligible patients were randomized to receive either: 
• Experimental Arm A: oral vemurafenib administered bid at a dose of 960 mg 
• Control Arm B: dacarbazine administered intravenously 1000 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 3 weeks 
(3 week cycle) 
The treatment allocation was based on a minimization algorithm using the following balancing factors: 
• Geographic region (North America, Western Europe, Australia/New Zealand, others) 
• Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs.1) 
• Metastatic classification (unresectable Stage IIIC, M1a, M1b, and M1c) 
• Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) normal vs. LDH elevated 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was designed as an open-label trial. 
Statistical methods 
The type 1 error (alpha) for this study was 0.05 (two-sided). To maintain the alpha level of 0.05 (two-
sided) while accounting for two co-primary endpoints, statistical significance for the comparison of OS 
was based on an alpha level of 0.045 (two-sided), and statistical significance for the comparison of PFS 
was based on an alpha level of 0.005 (two-sided).  
The Log-rank test was used for analysis of both OS and PFS. 
Survival time for patients with no post-baseline survival information was censored on the date of 
randomization. The primary analysis of OS was a comparison of the two treatment groups using an 
unstratified log-rank test (two-sided).  
For PFS, a total of 187 PFS events (disease progression or death) provided 90% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 0.55 for vemurafenib treatment relative to dacarbazine treatment, under the following 
assumptions: 0.005 significance level (two-sided), median PFS of 2.5 months in the dacarbazine arm 
and 4.5 months in the vemurafenib arm. The primary analysis of PFS was a comparison of the two 
treatment groups using an unstratified log-rank test (two-sided).  
A total of 196 deaths (100% information) provided 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 for 
death for vemurafenib treatment relative to dacarbazine treatment, under the assumption of a median 
survival of 8 months in the dacarbazine arm and 12.3 months in the vemurafenib arm 
One interim analysis for the co-primary endpoint of OS was planned at 50% information. The final 
analysis of the co-primary endpoint of PFS was planned to occur at the time of the interim analysis of 
OS. Review of the interim analysis results was performed by an external Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). 
There was no planned interim analysis for PFS. 
The primary analyses of OS and PFS was performed for the PP population. The PP population was 
defined as treated patients, excluding patients who violated any of the following inclusion criteria:

• Positive for BRAFV600 mutation by the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test  
• No prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for this disease 
• ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

Recruitment 
A total of 104 centres randomized patients into this study. Enrolment by centre ranged from 1 to 30 
patients across centres in the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, 
Sweden, Switzerland, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. Among randomized patients, a total of 408 
(60%) patients were enrolled in centres in Western Europe, 172 (25%) in North America, 77 (11%) in 
Australia/New Zealand, and 18 (3%) in Israel.  
Conduct of the study 
Study enrolment was initiated in January 2010 and completed in December 2010. There was a change 
in the statistical assumptions and PFS was changed from a secondary endpoint to a co-primary 
endpoint; as a result, the planned interim analysis was projected to occur sooner than originally 
planned. The SAP was revised prior to the interim analysis of OS to reflect the changes in the protocol.

The planned interim analysis of OS occurred on January 14, 2011. The DSMB recommended the cross 
over of patients treated with dacarbazine to vemurafenib.  
A total of 14 (4.2%) patients randomized to the vemurafenib group and 23 (6.8%) patients 
randomized to the dacarbazine group had a major protocol deviation. 
Major protocol deviations are presented in Table 18.

A summary of the OS data submitted at different data cut-off dates. The results show an increase in 
hazard ratio from 0.37 to 0.62 with progressively mature data. It is of note that the number of cross-
over patients from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was still low at the last data cut-off.

Secondary endpoints 
Best Overall Response 
A total of 106 of 219 patients in the vemurafenib group and 12 of 220 patients in the dacarbazine 
group had a response that was confirmed. The response rate in the vemurafenib group was 48.4% 
(95% CI: 41.6% –  55.2%) and in the dacarbazine group was 5.5% (95% CI: 2.8%, 9.3%) 
(p<0.0001, Chi-squared test with Shouten correction). 
The difference in ORR was 42.95% (95% CI: 35.4% – 50.5%) in favour of vemurafenib treatment. 
Duration of Response 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median duration of response was 5.49 months in the vemurafenib 
group (95% CI: 3.98 – 5.72) and was not reached in the dacarbazine group (95% CI: 4.60, not 
reached). At the time of analysis, the duration of response ranged from 1.22 to 7.62 months in the 
vemurafenib group and 1.18 to 5.55 months in the dacarbazine group. 
The majority of responders (75%) responded to treatment with vemurafenib by the time of the first 
post baseline tumour assessment (1.6 months). Among the 12 dacarbazine patients with a confirmed 
response, the median time to response was 2.72 months (range: 1.6 to 5.8).

Quality of life 
Analyses of FACT-M and its subscales suggested that there was no evidence that quality of life 
measured over time on study treatment differed between treatment groups. 
Analyses of pain score reported by the patient using a visual analog scale suggested that there was no 
evidence that pain score measured over time on study treatment differed between treatment groups. 
Analyses of the proportions of patients who experienced improvement from baseline as measured by 
oxygen saturation, use of narcotic pain analgesics, and physician’s assessment of global performance 
status suggested that there was no difference between the treatment groups. 
Mutation Analyses 
Figure 13 summarizes OS results by BRAF V600 mutation status as determined by Sanger sequencing. 
Treatment benefit of vemurafenib treatment on OS was observed for patients in the subgroup in whose 
tumours the V600E mutation was detected by both the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test and 
Sanger sequencing (N=164) (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.33 – 1.02) and the subgroup in whose tumours the 
V600E mutation was not detected by Sanger sequencing but whose tumours carry activating BRAF 
V600 mutations detected by the cobas test (N=56) (HR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.17 – 1.15).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analysis of BORR, PFS and OS was performed across the pivotal NO25026 trial, the NP22657 
supportive trial and the PLX06-02 dose finding trial (data not shown). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Supportive study 
Study NP22657: An Open-Label, Multi-Center, Phase II Study of Continuous Oral Dosing of 
RO5185426 in Previously treated Patients With Metastatic Melanoma. 
Study NP22657 was a single-arm, Multi-Centre, Phase II Study of Continuous Oral Dosing of 
vemurafenib in Previously Treated Patients with Metastatic Melanoma.  
Patients must have had a BRAFV600E mutation-positive melanoma (using the Roche cobas 4800 BRAF 
V600 Mutation Assay) prior to administration of vemurafenib. A summary of the efficacy results is 
shown in Table 29.

Of the 132 patients in this study, 56 (42%) had a dose reduction for any reason. Of these 56 patients 
who had their dose reduced, the majority (39/56 patients) had one dose reduction. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
An open-label, multicenter, international, randomized phase III study supports the use of vemurafenib 
in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma. Patients were randomized to treatment with vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) or 
dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks).  
The efficacy of vemurafenib has been evaluated in 336 patients from a phase III clinical trial 
(NO25026) and 132 patients from a phase II clinical trial (NP 22657). All patients were required to 
have advanced melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations according to the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation 
Test.  
The primary endpoint of the pivotal phase III study NO25026 was to assess the efficacy and safety of 
vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine in melanoma patients with BRAF V600E mutation. The open 
label, two arm trial design was considered adequate. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
considered acceptable as well as the primary and secondary endpoints. The CHMP had some initial 
concerns over the premature analysis performed by the applicant, which required modification of the 
SAP and lead to the DSMB recommendation that patients be allowed to cross over to vemurafenib 
treatment at the time of the interim analysis. Despite these initial concerns, the applicant provided 
satisfactory documentation to assess the benefits and risks of vemurafenib treatment and provided 
sufficient and adequate data to assess and establish the benefit risk balance of the product.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 675 patients were randomized to vemurafenib (n=337) or dacarbazine (n=338). Most 
patients were male (56%) and Caucasian (99%), the median age was 54 years (24% were ≥ 65 
years), all patients had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and the majority of patients had stage M1c 
disease (65%). The co-primary efficacy endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS).  
At the pre-specified interim analysis with a December 30, 2010 data cut-off, significant improvements 
in the co-primary endpoints of OS (p<0.0001) and PFS (p<0.0001) (unstratified log-rank test) were 
observed. Upon Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommendation, those results were released in 
January 2011 and the study was modified to permit dacarbazine patients to cross over to receive 
vemurafenib. Post-hoc survival analyses were undertaken as described in Table 25. The subgroup 
analyses supported the data from the primary analyses. 
A total of 19 patients out of 220 whose tumours were analysed by retrospective sequencing were 
reported to have BRAF V600K mutation-positive melanoma in NO25026. Although limited by the low 
number of patients, efficacy analyses among these patients with V600K-positive tumours suggested 
treatment benefit of vemurafenib in terms of OS, PFS and confirmed best overall response. No data are 
available in patients with melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutations others than V600E and V600K.  
A phase II single-arm, multi-center, multinational study was conducted in 132 patients who had BRAF 
V600E mutation-positive metastatic melanoma according to the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test 
and had received at least one prior therapy. The median age was 52 years with 19% of patients being 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 65/103
 
older than 65 years. The majority of patients was male (61%), Caucasian (99%), and had stage M1c 
disease (61%). Forty-nine percent of patients failed ≥ 2 prior therapies.  
With a median follow-up of 12.9 months (range, 0.6 to 20.1), the primary endpoint of confirmed best 
overall response rate (CR + PR) as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) was 53% 
(95% CI: 44%, 62%). Median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% CI: 11.6, 18.3). The overall 
survival rate at 6 months was 77% (95% CI: 70%, 85%) and at 12 months was 58% (95% CI: 49%, 
67%).  
Nine of the 132 patients enrolled into NP22657 had V600K mutation positive tumours according to 
retrospective Sanger sequencing. Amongst these patients, 3 had a PR, 3 had SD, 2 had PD and one 
was not evaluable. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
vemurafenib in all subsets of the paediatric population in melanoma (see section 4.2 of the SmPC for 
information on paediatric use). 
The results of the pivotal phase III study NO25026, and the supportive phase II study NP22657, were 
considered consistent and the CHMP considered that superiority of vemurafenib over dacarbazine had 
been demonstrated in the proposed indication: “Vemurafenib is indicated in monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
(see section 5.1).” 
It is of note, however, that the median survival benefit in the confirmatory study is small (3.6 months 
at the latest data cut-off 03/10/11), possibly due to the cross over of patients at the time of the 
interim analysis, with a median OS of 9.9 month versus 13.2 months for dacarbazine and vemurafenib 
(HR 0.67; 95%CI 0.49 – 0.77; p=0.003), respectively.  
The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test used in the pivotal trial is a real-time PCR assay that was 
designed to detect specifically the BRAFV600E mutation but will also detect other mutations such as 
V600K or V600D. The data on mutation analysis and OS are suggestive of a treatment benefit of 
vemurafenib on OS (HR 0.27; 95% CI: 0.05 – 1.51) and PFS (HR 0.09, 95% CI, 0.02, 0.45) in patients 
with the V600K mutation by Sanger sequencing. 
Non-clinical data appear to support the limited clinical data on V600 mutations other than V600E.  The 
clinical data indicated that vemurafenib inhibited BRAF with mutation V600E but results from the 
pivotal study showed that it may have also inhibited with V600K mutations. Hence, the CHMP 
evaluated the data and concluded that there was enough evidence to support a broader indication of 
“V600 mutation” and not to restrict the indication to BRAF V600E patient population. The CHMP 
requested the applicant to perform further analyses on V600K mutation melanoma patients and other 
BRAF mutations not detected by the COBAS assay to better characterise the mechanism of action. This 
post authorisation measure is covered in the RMP. 
It is important to note that there appears to be no benefit in patients which are BRAF WT. This is 
stated in the SmPC in section 4.2 where “Treatment with vemurafenib should be initiated and 
supervised by a qualified physician experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. Before 
taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a 
validated test (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). “ and in section 5.1 of the SmPC where it is stated that 
“Before taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status confirmed 
by a validated test. In the phase II and phase III clinical trials, eligible patients were identified using a 
real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test). This test has 
CE marking and is used to assess the BRAF mutation status of DNA isolated from formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue. It was designed to detect the predominant BRAF V600E 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 66/103
 
mutation with high sensitivity (down to 5% V600E sequence in a background of wild-type sequence 
from FFPE-derived DNA). Non-clinical and clinical studies with retrospective sequencing analyses have 
shown that the test also detects the less common BRAF V600D mutations and V600K mutations with 
lower sensitivity. Of the specimens available from the non-clinical and clinical studies (n=467) that 
were mutation-positive by the cobas test and additionally analyzed by sequencing, no specimen was 
identified as being wild type by both Sanger and 454 sequencing.“ 
There were too few non-caucasians to assess treatment benefit. A warning was introduced in the SmpC 
in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Other guidance on vemurafenib treatment determined by the CHMP include: 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with vemurafenib should continue until disease progression or the development of 
unacceptable toxicity (see table 1 below). 
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, it can be taken up to 4 hours prior to the next dose to maintain the twice daily 
regimen. Both doses should not be taken at the same time.  
Vomiting 
In case of vomiting after vemurafenib administration the patient should not take an additional dose of 
the medicinal product but the treatment should be continued as usual.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial NO25026 provided satisfactory evidence that vemurafenib prolonged OS and PFS in 
melanoma patients which were tested as BRAF V600 mutation positive in comparison with standard 
treatment dacarbazine. Efficacy has been demonstrated. The CHMP highlighted the fact that it is 
important that patients must be diagnosed a priori with BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status 
before taking vemurafenib. Based on the last data cut-off of 03/10/11, the benefits on OS and PFS 
appear established enough to exclude the confounding effect of the early interim analysis. The CHMP 
considers that more mature data on survival are required to better determine the magnitude of the 
long-term effect of vemurafenib treatment.   
The CHMP considers the following measures should be provided as a condition for the marketing 
authorisation: 
 
Updated survival analyses from the pivotal trial NO25026. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety analyses are based on data collected in 866 patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug, vemurafenib (N=584) or dacarbazine (N=282). Safety analyses were performed for the 
following studies or populations: 
• The randomized Phase III study (NO25026; N=336 for vemurafenib and N=282 for dacarbazine) 
• The pooled safety population (Phase 1 PLX06-02 and Phase 2 NP22657 studies; N=164) 
• The Phase 2 study (NP22657; N=132) 
• The melanoma extension cohort of the Phase 1 study (PLX06-02; N=32)

• Additional safety information from the supporting clinical pharmacology (NP25158; N=7, NP22676; 
N=25 and NP25163; N=52) 
The safety population was defined as all treated patients who had at least one on-study assessment. 
Patient exposure 
As of the clinical cut-off date 30/12/10, the median total cumulative dose was 159 grams for 
vemurafenib vs 2000 mg/m2 for dacarbazine. The median duration of treatment was 3.1 months 
(94.4 days) in the vemurafenib group and 0.76 months (23.1 days) in the dacarbazine group (time 
from first to last of the infusions given once every 3 weeks). 
The median total daily vemurafenib dose was1.87 g/day. The median dose intensities (defined as the 
total actual dose taken divided by the total planned dose between dates of first and last dose) were 
97.6% in the vemurafenib group vs 95.8% in the dacarbazine group. A summary of patient exposure is 
shown in Table 30. 
The median number of cycles of dacarbazine was 2 with a median of 1000 mg/m2 dacarbazine received 
per cycle.

Adverse events  
The most commonly reported AEs in the vemurafenib group were in the body system of skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders, where 90% of patients had at least one AE versus 19% in the 
dacarbazine group. The most commonly occurring AEs in this body system were rash, alopecia, and 
photosensitivity reaction ( 30% each vs  4% in the dacarbazine group). Gastrointestinal disorders 
also occurred frequently and with an overall similar incidence in the two groups (63% vemurafenib, 
65% dacarbazine). Table 31 shows a summary of ADRs that are >10% in the vemurafenib treatment 
arm.

* adverse drug reactions, reported using MedDRA and graded using NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 (NCI common toxicity criteria) for assessment 
of toxicity. 
# all cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma were to be reported as Grade 3 per instructions to study investigators and no dose 
modification or interruption was required. 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) (> 30%) reported with vemurafenib include 
arthralgia, fatigue, rash, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, alopecia and pruritus. CuSCC was very 
commonly reported and was most commonly treated by local excision.  
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
ADRs which were reported in melanoma patients are listed below by MedDRA body system organ class, 
frequency and grade of severity. The following convention has been used for the classification of 
frequency: 
Very common ≥ 1/10 
Common ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 
Uncommon ≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100 
Rare ≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000 
Very rare < 1/10,000 
In this section, ADRs are based on results in 500 patients from a phase III randomized open label 
study in adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or stage IV melanoma, as well 
as a phase II single-arm study in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive stage IV melanoma who 
had previously failed at least one prior systemic therapy (see section 5.1). All terms included are based 
on the highest percentage observed among phase II and phase III clinical trials. Within each frequency 
grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing severity and were reported using NCI-CTCAE v 
4.0 (common toxicity criteria) for assessment of toxicity.

The majority of patients in both treatment groups had AEs that were Grade 1/mild in intensity (94% 
vemurafenib, 78% dacarbazine) or Grade 2/moderate in intensity (78% vemurafenib, 51% 
dacarbazine). 
A greater percentage of patients had AEs of Grade 3 or above in the vemurafenib group (50%) than 
the dacarbazine group (30%). The most common AEs  Grade 3 in the vemurafenib group were 
(preferred terms): SCC of skin (11%) and rash (8%); the most common in the dacarbazine group 
were neutropenia (9%) and decreased neutrophil count (4%). Fewer Grade 4 events were reported in 
the vemurafenib group (4%) compared to the dacarbazine group (8%). The incidence of Grade 5 
events was similar (2%) in both treatment groups. Grade 4 AEs in the vemurafenib group included:

pulmonary embolism (3 patients), increased GGT (2 patients), increased blood creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK), increased blood bilirubin, increased lipase, ageusia, intraventricular haemorrhage, pneumonia, 
pneumothorax, respiratory distress, neutropenia (all 1 patient each). As of the clinical cut-off, five 
vemurafenib patients had a total of six Grade 4 AEs that were considered by the investigator to be 
related to treatment (blood bilirubin increase, gamma glutamyltransferase increase, ageusia, blood 
creatine phosphokinase increase, neutropenia). 
A summary of AEs of grade 3, 4, and 5 is shown in Table 33.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
As of the cut-off date 30/12/10, SAEs were reported by 33% of vemurafenib patients and 16% of 
dacarbazine patients. There were 110 vemurafenib patients that reported a total of 157 SAEs. Of these 
157 SAEs, the majority (116/157 [74%]) were considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
The most common SAEs in the vemurafenib group were (preferred terms): SCC of the skin (11%) and 
keratoacanthoma (7%); all cases of these SAEs were considered drug related by the investigator.

Significant adverse events 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome 
There was one patient in the vemurafenib treated group who had Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. The 
event was considered related to vemurafenib by the investigator and resolved when vemurafenib was 
discontinued.   
Cutaneous small cell carcinoma  
Cases of cuSCC have been reported in patients treated with vemurafenib. The incidence of cuSCC in 
vemurafenib-treated patients across studies was approximately 20%. The phase III study, out of the 
62 patients analysed the mean and median time to first occurrence of cuSCC was 8.3 weeks and 7.1 
weeks, respectively; (range: 2.7 to 24.9 weeks). CuSCC usually occurred early in the course of 
treatment with a median time to the first appearance of 7 to 8 weeks. Of the patients who experienced 
cuSCC, approximately 33% experienced > 1 occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 
weeks. 
The majority of the excised lesions reviewed by an independent central dermatopathology laboratory 
were classified as SCC-keratoacanthoma subtype or with mixed-keratoacanthoma features (52%). 
Most lesions classified as “other” (43%) were benign skin lesions (e.g. verruca vulgaris, actinic 
keratosis, benign keratosis, cyst/benign cyst).  
There were 34 patients (55%) that received the prescribed daily dose (960 mg bid), 25 (40%) were 
receiving less than the prescribed dose, and three patients (5%) were receiving slightly more than the 
prescribed daily dose, when they experienced their first occurrence of cuSCC. All but 1 case of cuSCC 
adverse events in the vemurafenib group were considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Cases of cuSCC were typically managed with simple excision, and patients generally continued on 
treatment without dose modification (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). Summary of data 
are shown in Table 37. 
Patients aged  65 years had approximately 2.5- to 5-times greater chance of developing cuSCC 
compared to those <65 years of age.

New primary melanoma 
New primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials. These cases were managed with 
excision, and patients continued treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring for skin lesions should 
occur as outlined in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Rash 
Rash AEs were reported in 202 patients (60%) in the vemurafenib group and 10 patients (4%) in the 
dacarbazine group. Most rash AEs were Grade 1 or and were considered treatment related by the 
investigator. None resulted in discontinuation from treatment but about 54 of 250 events (22%; in the 
vemurafenib group) led to dose modification or interruption. 
Photosensitivity 
Photosensitivity AEs were reported in 124 patients (37%) in the vemurafenib group and 10 patients 
(4%) in the dacarbazine group in the pivotal trial. Almost all of the events were considered drug 
related by the investigator. None resulted in discontinuation from treatment. A summary of the 
photosensitivity AEs is presented in Table 38.

Analysis of centralized ECG data from an open-label uncontrolled phase II QT sub-study in 132 patients 
dosed with vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (NP22657) showed an exposure-dependent QTc 
prolongation. The mean QTc effect remained stable between 12-15 ms beyond the first month of 
treatment, with the largest mean QTc prolongation (15.1 ms; upper 95% CI: 17.7 ms) observed within 
the first 6 months (n=90 patients). Two patients (1.5%) developed treatment-emergent absolute QTc 
values >500 ms (CTC Grade 3), and only one patient (0.8%) exhibited a QTc change from baseline of 
>60 ms (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with 
vemurafenib. Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, generalized 
rash, erythema or hypotension. In patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions, 
vemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.4). 
Other clinically meaningful AEs 
The following events were considered as clinically meaningful events (ADRs) in the Phase 1 PLX06-02, 
Phase 2 NP22657, and Phase III NO25026 studies: 
 
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: keratosis pilaris, erythema nodosum, Stevens-
Johnson syndrome 
 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthritis 
 
Nervous system disorders: dizziness, neuropathy peripheral, facial (VIIth) nerve paralysis 
 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: basal cell carcinoma 
 
Infections and infestations: folliculitis 
 
Investigations: weight decreased 
 
Eye disorders: retinal vein occlusion (RVO), uveitis 
 
Vascular disorders: vasculitis 
The following rare but clinically meaningful AEs (ADRs) were also reported: facial (VIIth) nerve 
paralysis (four events total: one in Phase III study NO25026 and three in Phase 2 study NP22657), 
uveitis (11 events total; four in Phase III study NO25026, five in Phase 2 study NP22657, and two in 
Phase 1 study PLX06-02), and RVO (one event in Phase 2 study NP22657). 
Laboratory findings 
Liver function abnormality AEs were reported in 18% of vemurafenib patients in the Phase III 
NO25026 study, 34% of patients in the pooled safety population, and 24% of patients across the three 
clinical pharmacology studies. Among those patients who developed liver function abnormality AEs, the 
mean time to first onset was 6 to 7 weeks and the median 3 to 6 weeks. A summary liver 
abnormalities is shown in Table 40.

Post-baseline increases in laboratory parameters to Grade 3 or 4 were uncommon; most occurred in 
<5% of patients. Laboratory parameters where post-baseline increases to Grade 3 or 4 occurred in 
 5% of patients included: 
 
decreased neutrophils: <1% vemurafenib group, 13% dacarbazine 
 
increased GGT:  11% vemurafenib, 9% dacarbazine  
 
decreased WBC: <1% vemurafenib, 6% dacarbazine  
 
decreased lymphocytes: 8% vemurafenib, 7% dacarbazine  
Hepatic enzyme increase  
Liver enzyme abnormalities reported in the phase III clinical study are expressed below as the 
proportion of patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme 
abnormalities: 
 
Very common: GGT  
 
Common: ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin 
 
Uncommon: AST 
There were no increases to Grade 4 ALT, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. 
Safety in special populations 
There was no evidence that any increases in AEs on vemurafenib compared to dacarbazine were 
greater in one gender subgroup than the other. Within the vemurafenib treatment group, the 
incidences of Grade  3 AEs of rash and other skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, photosensitivity, 
and arthralgia were higher in female patients than male patients. 
A summary of the AEs by age group is shown in Table 41.

old, experienced a higher incidence of preferred terms: SCC of the skin (19% vs. 8%, respectively, 
rash (13% vs. 7%, respectively), and GGT increased (4% vs 2%, respectively). For AEs of Grade ≥ 3 
intensity, patients < 65 years old, compared to patients ≥ 65 years old, experienced a higher incidence 
of photosensitivity (4% vs 0%, respectively) and maculopapular rash (3% vs 1%, respectively). Each 
of these events occurred in a higher percentage of patients in the vemurafenib group than in the 
dacarbazine group. 
Patients < 65 years reported a higher rate of Grade ≥ 3 (NO25026): 
• decreased haemoglobin (5.6% vs 3%) 
• increased alkaline phosphatase (4% vs 2%) 
• increased ALT (4% vs 0%) 
For AEs of Grade ≥ 3 intensity (pooled safety population), the incidence of neoplasms (benign, 
malignant, and unspecified; (59% vs 21%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (21% vs 9%), and 
renal and urinary disorders (10% vs 2%) was greater in older patients than younger patients, 
respectively.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There were no safety studies submitted for drug-drug interaction. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As of the cut-off date 30/12/10, AEs that led to withdrawal of treatment occurred in 19 patients (6%) 
in the vemurafenib group and 12 patients (4%) in the dacarbazine group.  
Shock 
One patient (1402) discontinued vemurafenib treatment for safety reasons in the supporting clinical 
pharmacology study. The patient developed shock on treatment day 8. Upon re-challenge with a single 
dose of 240 mg vemurafenib, the patient became hypotensive, but responded to resuscitation and was 
discharged from the hospital; study treatment was permanently discontinued.  
Post marketing experience 
The applicant did not submit reports on post-marketing experience with vemurafenib. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database comprises of 584 patients which have been treated with at least one dose of 
vemurafenib. Most patients on vemurafenib experienced at least one AE (97%) during treatment but 
the majority was mild and manageable. The most common AEs reported in vemurafenib treated 
patients were rash, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, arthralgia and fatigue. The most common 
adverse events of grade 3 and 4 were rash and sensitivity and arthralgia. 
Almost half of the patients (44.6%) experienced a dose reduction or treatment interruption as a 
consequence of an AE. The most common cause for discontinuation of vemurafenib was disease 
progression. It should be noted that the AEs appear to occur early with a median of 7 weeks. Because 
of the short duration of treatment (median 4 months) there is lack of safety data for long-term 
exposure to vemurafenib. This is acceptable as there will be further updates on safety. 
There is a risk that other malignancies have not been detected because of the short exposure. There is 
a lack of safety data regarding the non-caucasian population.  This has been noted in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
It is contraindicated to take vemurafenib in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to 
any of the excipients. 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 81/103
 
Before taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status confirmed 
by a validated test. The efficacy and safety of vemurafenib in patients with tumours expressing BRAF 
V600 non-E mutations have not been convincingly established (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Vemurafenib should not be used in patients with wild type BRAF malignant melanoma. 
Hypersensitivity reaction 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported in association with 
vemurafenib (see sections 4.3 and 4.8 of the SmPC). Severe hypersensitivity reactions may include 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, generalized rash, erythema or hypotension. In patients who experience 
severe hypersensitivity reactions, vemurafenib treatment should be permanently discontinued.  
Dermatologic Reactions 
Severe dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, including rare 
cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the pivotal clinical trial. In 
patients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction, vemurafenib treatment should be 
permanently discontinued. 
QT prolongation 
Exposure-dependent QT prolongation was observed in an uncontrolled, open-label phase II study in 
previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). QT prolongation 
may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. Treatment with 
vemurafenib is not recommended in patients with uncorrectable electrolyte abnormalities (including 
magnesium), long QT syndrome or who are taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT 
interval. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrolytes (including magnesium) must be monitored in all patients 
before treatment with vemurafenib, after one month of treatment and after dose modification. 
Further monitoring is recommended in particular in patients with moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment monthly during the first 3 months of treatment followed by every 3 months thereafter or 
more often as clinically indicated. Initiation of treatment with vemurafenib is not recommended in 
patients with QTc>500 milliseconds (ms). If during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 ms, vemurafenib 
treatment should be temporarily interrupted, electrolyte abnormalities (including magnesium) should 
be corrected, and cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation (e.g. congestive heart failure, 
bradyarrhythmias) should be controlled. Re-initiation of treatment should occur once the QTc 
decreases below 500 ms and at a lower dose as described in Table 1. Permanent discontinuation of 
vemurafenib treatment is recommended if the QTc increase meets values of both > 500 ms and >60 
ms change from pre-treatment values. 
Ophthalmologic reactions 
Serious ophthalmologic reactions, including uveitis, iritis and retinal vein occlusion, have been 
reported. Monitor patients routinely for ophthalmologic reactions.  
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cuSCC)  
Cases of cuSCC (which include those classified as keratoacanthoma or mixed keratoacanthoma subtype) 
have been reported in patients treated with vemurafenib (see section 4.8). It is recommended that all 
patients receive a dermatologic evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and be monitored routinely 
while on therapy. Any suspicious skin lesions should be excised, sent for dermatopathologic evaluation 
and treated as per local standard of care. The prescriber should examine the patient monthly during 
Zelboraf 
CHMP assessment report  
 
 
 
Page 82/103
 
and up to six months after treatment for cuSCC. In patients who develop cuSCC, it is recommended to 
continue the treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring should continue for 6 months following 
discontinuation of vemurafenib or until initiation of another anti-neoplastic therapy. Patients should be 
instructed to inform their physicians upon the occurrence of any skin changes. 
Non-Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (non-cuSCC) 
No cases of non-cuSCC have been reported in clinical trials with vemurafenib in melanoma. Patients 
should undergo a head and neck examination, consisting of at least a visual inspection of oral mucosa 
and lymph node palpation prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months during treatment.  
In addition, patients should undergo a chest Computerised Tomography (CT) scan, prior to treatment 
and every 6 months during treatment.  
Anal examinations and pelvic examinations (for women) are recommended before and at the end of 
treatment or when considered clinically indicated. 
Following discontinuation of vemurafenib, monitoring for non-cuSCC should continue for up to 6 
months or until initiation of another anti-neoplastic therapy. Abnormal findings should be managed 
according to clinical practices. 
New primary melanoma 
New primary melanomas have been reported in clinical trials. Cases were managed with excision and 
patients continued treatment without dose adjustment. Monitoring for skin lesions should occur as 
outlined above for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. 
Liver injury 
Liver laboratory abnormalities may occur with vemurafenib (see section 4.8). Liver enzymes 
(transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin should be monitored before initiation of 
treatment and monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Laboratory abnormalities should be 
managed with dose reduction, treatment interruption or with treatment discontinuation (see sections 
4.2 and 4.4).  
Hepatic impairment 
No adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Patients with mild 
hepatic impairment due to liver metastases without hyperbilirubinaemia may be monitored according 
to the general recommendations. There are only very limited data available in patients with moderate 
to severe hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment may have 
increased exposure (see section 5.2). Thus close monitoring is warranted especially after the first few 
weeks of treatment as accumulation may occur over an extended period of time (several weeks). In 
addition ECG monitoring every month during the first three months is recommended.  
Renal impairment 
No adjustment to the starting dose is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
There are only limited data available in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2 of the 
SmPC). Vemurafenib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment and 
patients should be closely monitored. 
Photosensitivity 
Mild to severe photosensitivity was reported in patients who received vemurafenib in clinical studies 
(see section 4.8). All patients should be advised to avoid sun exposure while taking vemurafenib. While 
taking the medicinal product, patients should be advised to wear protective clothing and use a broad

spectrum Ultraviolet A (UVA)/Ultraviolet B (UVB) sunscreen and lip balm (Sun Protection Factor ≥ 30) 
when outdoors to help protect against sunburn.  
For photosensitivity grade 2 (intolerable) or greater, dose modifications are recommended (see section 
4.2). 
Effects of vemurafenib on other medicinal products 
Vemurafenib may increase the plasma exposure of medicinal products predominantly metabolized by 
CYP1A2 and decrease the plasma exposure of medicines predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, 
including oral contraceptives. Dose adjustments for medicinal products medications predominantly 
metabolized via CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 should be considered based on their therapeutic windows before 
concomitantly treating with vemurafenib (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Exercise caution and consider additional INR (International Normalized Ratio) monitoring when 
vemurafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin. 
Effect of other medicinal products on vemurafenib 
Vemurafenib pharmacokinetics could be affected by medicines that inhibit or influence P-gp (e.g. 
verapamil, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, dronedarone, amiodarone, itraconazole, 
ranolazine) (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant administration of potent inducers of P-gp, glucuronidation, CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, 
rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s Wort [hypericin]) should be avoided when possible 
(see section 4.5). Alternative treatment with less inducing potential should be considered to maintain 
the efficacy of vemurafenib. 
Women of chidbearing potential / Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 6 
months after treatment.  
Vemurafenib might decrease the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data regarding the use of vemurafenib in pregnant women.  
Vemurafenib revealed no evidence of teratogenicity in rat or rabbit embryo/foetuses (see section 5.3). 
In animal studies, vemurafenib was found to cross the placenta. Vemurafenib should not be 
administered to pregnant women unless the possible benefit to the mother outweighs the possible risk 
to the foetus.  
Breastfeeding 
It is not known whether vemurafenib is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot 
be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue 
vemurafenib therapy taking into account the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No specific studies with vemurafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. 
However, in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no histopathological findings were noted on 
reproductive organs (see section 5.3 of the SmPC).

The effects of vemurafenib on the ability to drive and use machines have not been studied. Patients 
should be made aware of the potential fatigue or eye problems that could be a reason for not driving. 
Dermatologic Reactions  
Severe dermatologic reactions have been reported in patients receiving vemurafenib, including rare 
cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in the pivotal clinical trial. In 
patients who experience a severe dermatologic reaction, vemurafenib treatment should be 
permanently discontinued. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the phase III study, ninety-four (28%) of 336 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
treated with vemurafenib were ≥ 65 years. Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may be more likely to 
experience adverse reactions, including cuSCC, decreased appetite, and cardiac disorders. 
Gender 
During clinical trials with vemurafenib, grade 3 adverse reactions reported more frequently in females 
than males were rash, arthralgia and photosensitivity. 
There is no specific antidote for overdose of vemurafenib. Patients who develop adverse reactions 
should receive appropriate symptomatic treatment. No cases of overdose have been observed with 
vemurafenib in clinical trials. In case of suspected overdose, vemurafenib should be withheld and 
supportive care initiated.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The AES reported for patients being treated with vemurafenib appear to be mostly of low grade and 
manageable. It was noted that cuSCC was predominantly found in vemurafenib treated patients after a 
short exposure to the drug. The CHMP considered that with an early detection program and 
intervention, the safety issue of cuSCC was adequately managed.

Section 4.4 of the SmPC: 
Cases of cuSCC (which include those classified as 
keratoacanthoma or mixed keratoacanthoma 
subtype) have been reported in patients treated 
with vemurafenib.  
It is recommended that all patients receive a 
dermatologic evaluation prior to initiation of 
therapy and be monitored routinely while on 
therapy. Any suspicious skin lesions should be 
excised, sent for dermatopathologic evaluation 
and treated as per local standard of care. In 
patients who develop cuSCC, it is recommended to 
continue the treatment without dose adjustment. 
Monitoring should continue for 6 months following 
discontinuation of vemurafenib or until initiation of 
another anti-neoplastic therapy. Patients should be 
instructed to inform their physicians upon the 
occurrence of any skin changes. 
 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
Cases of cuSCC have been reported in patients 
treated with vemurafenib. The incidence of cuSCC 
in vemurafenib-treated patients across studies was 
approximately 20%. The majority of the excised 
lesions reviewed by an independent central 
dermatopathology laboratory were classified as 
SCC-keratoacanthoma subtype or with mixed-
keratoacanthoma features (52%). Most lesions 
classified as “other” (43%) were benign skin 
lesions (e.g. verruca vulgaris, actinic keratosis, 
benign keratosis, cyst/benign cyst). CuSCC usually 
occurred early in the course of treatment with a 
median time to the first appearance of 7 to 8 
weeks. Of the patients who experienced cuSCC, 
approximately 33% experienced > 1 occurrence 
with median time between occurrences of 6 
weeks. Cases of cuSCC were typically managed 
with simple excision, and patients generally 
continued on treatment without dose modification

Exposure-dependent QT prolongation was 
observed in an uncontrolled, open-label phase II 
study in previously treated patients with 
metastatic melanoma (see section 4.8). QT 
prolongation may lead to an increased risk of 
ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de 
Pointes. Treatment with vemurafenib is not 
recommended in patients with uncorrectable 
electrolyte abnormalities (including magnesium), 
long QT syndrome or who are taking medicinal 
products known to prolong the QT interval.

(including magnesium) must be monitored in all 
patients before treatment with vemurafenib, after 
one month of treatment and after dose 
modification. Further monitoring is recommended 
in particular in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment monthly during the first 3 
months of treatment followed by every 3 months 
thereafter or more often as clinically indicated. 
Initiation of treatment with vemurafenib is not 
recommended in patients with QTc>500 ms. If 
during treatment the QTc exceeds 500 
milliseconds (ms), vemurafenib treatment should 
be temporarily interrupted, electrolyte 
abnormalities (including magnesium) should be 
corrected, and cardiac risk factors for QT 
prolongation (e.g. congestive heart failure, 
bradyarrhythmias) should be controlled. Re-
initiation of treatment should occur once the QTc 
decreases below 500 ms and at a lower dose as 
described in Table 1. Permanent discontinuation of 
vemurafenib treatment is recommended if the QTc 
increase meets values of both > 500 ms and >60 
ms change from pre-treatment values. 
 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC: 
Analysis of centralized ECG data from an open-
label uncontrolled Phase II QT sub-study in 132 
patients dosed with vemurafenib 960 mg twice 
daily (NP22657) showed an exposure-dependent 
QTc prolongation. The mean QTc effect remained 
stable between 12-15 ms beyond the first month 
of treatment, with the largest mean QTc 
prolongation (15.1 ms; upper 95% CI: 17.7 ms) 
observed within the first 6 months (n=90 
patients). Two patients (1.5%) developed 
treatment-emergent absolute QTc values >500 ms 
(CTC Grade 3), and only one patient (0.8%) 
exhibited a QTc change from baseline of >60 ms.

Vemurafenib may increase the plasma exposure of

CYP1A2 and decrease the plasma exposure of 
medicines predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, 
including oral contraceptives. Dose adjustments 
for medicinal products predominantly metabolized 
via CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 should be considered based 
on their therapeutic windows before concomitantly 
treating with vemurafenib (see sections 4.5 and 
4.6). 
 
Exercise caution and consider additional INR 
(International Normalized Ratio) monitoring when 
vemurafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin. 
 
Vemurafenib pharmacokinetics could be affected 
by medicines that inhibit or influence P-gp (e.g. 
verapamil, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, 
quinidine, dronedarone, amiodarone, itraconazole, 
ranolazine). 
 
Concomitant administration of potent inducers of 
P-gp, glucuronidation, CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, 
rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or St John’s 
Wort [hypericin]) should be avoided when 
possible. Alternative treatment with less inducing

efficacy of vemurafenib. 
 
Section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal 
products and other forms of interaction in the EU 
SmPC states the following: 
 
Effects of vemurafenib on CYP substrates 
CYP1A2 inhibition was observed when a single 
dose of caffeine was co-administered after repeat 
dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days. This resulted 
in an average 2.5-fold increase (maximum up to 
10-fold) in caffeine plasma exposure after 
vemurafenib treatment. Vemurafenib may increase 
the plasma exposure of substances predominantly 
metabolized by CYP1A2 and dose adjustments 
should be considered. 
 
CYP3A4 induction was observed when a single 
dose of midazolam was co-administered after 
repeat dosing with vemurafenib for 15 days. This 
resulted in an average 32% decrease (maximum 
up to 80%) in midazolam plasma exposure after 
vemurafenib treatment. Vemurafenib may 
decrease the plasma exposure of substances 
predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. On this 
basis, the efficacy of contraceptive pills 
metabolized by CYP3A4 used concomitantly with 
vemurafenib might be decreased. Dose 
adjustments for CYP3A4 substrates with narrow 
therapeutic window should be considered. 
 
Mild induction of CYP2B6 by vemurafenib was 
noted in vitro at a vemurafenib concentration of 
10 µM. It is currently unknown whether 
vemurafenib at a plasma level of 100 µM observed 
in patients at steady state (approximately 50 
µg/ml) may decrease plasma concentrations of 
concomitantly administered CYP2B6 substrates, 
such as bupropion. 
 
When a single dose of warfarin was co-
administered after repeat dosing with vemurafenib 
for 15 days, some patients exhibited increased 
warfarin exposure (mean 20%) (see section 4.4). 
Caution should be exercised when vemurafenib is 
co-administered with warfarin (CYP2C9) in 
patients with melanoma. 
 
Due to the long half-life of vemurafenib, the full 
inhibitory effect of vemurafenib on a concomitant 
medicinal product might not be observed before 8 
days of vemurafenib treatment. After cessation of 
vemurafenib treatment, a washout of 8 days might 
be necessary to avoid an interaction with a 
subsequent treatment.

(Routine and Additional) 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that 
vemurafenib is an inhibitor of the efflux 
transporter (P-gp). The clinical relevance of this 
finding is unknown. It cannot be excluded that 
vemurafenib may increase the exposure of other 
medicines transported by P-gp. 
The possible effect of vemurafenib on other 
transporters (e.g. BCRP) is currently unknown. 
 
Effects of concomitant medicines on vemurafenib 
In vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 metabolism 
and glucuronidation are responsible for the 
metabolism of vemurafenib. Biliary excretion 
appears to be another important elimination 
pathway. There are no clinical data available 
showing the effect of strong inducers or inhibitors 
of CYP3A4 and/or transport protein activity on 
vemurafenib exposure. Vemurafenib should be 
used with caution in combination with potent 
inhibitors of CYP3A4, glucuronidation and/or 
transport proteins (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posaconazole, nefazodone, 
atazanavir).   
Concomitant administration of potent inducers of 
P-gp, glucuronidation, and/or CYP3A4 (e.g. 
rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin or 
St John’s Wort [hypericum perforatum]) may lead 
to supoptimal exposure to vemurafenib and should 
be avoided.  
 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that 
vemurafenib is a substrate of the efflux 
transporter, P-gp. The effects of P-gp inducers and 
inhibitors on vemurafenib exposure are unknown. 
It cannot be excluded that vemurafenib 
pharmacokinetics could be affected by medicines 
that inhibit or influence P-gp (e.g. verapamil, 
clarithromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, quinidine, 
dronedarone, amiodarone, itraconazole, 
ranolazine). 
 
It is currently unknown whether vemurafenib is a 
substrate also to other transport proteins.

Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Vemurafenib, an inhibitor of oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation, has shown a superior efficacy compared 
to dacarbazine in the pivotal phase III study N025026 in patients that have melanoma tumours that 
harbour the BRAFV600 mutation. The trial also showed a statistical significant improvement in PFS of 
approximately 4 months with 5.32 months vs 1.61 months (HR 0.26; CI 0.20 – 0.30; p<0.0001) (data 
cut-off 30/12/10) and an increase in OS of 3.6 months with 9.9 vs 13.2 months (HR 0.67; CI 0.54 – 
0.84; p=0.0003) (uncensored data, data cut-off 03/10/11) for vemurafenib and dacarbazine

respectively. Subgroup analysis supported the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The CHMP considered 
that the survival data were clinically relevant and that clinical benefit had been demonstrated.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
There is uncertainty in the knowledge of the long term benefit of vemurafenib in melanoma patients 
that harbour the BRAFV600 mutation and the impact of prognostic factors. This, however, does not 
affect the observed clinical relevant benefit for patients in OS and the positive benefit risk of 
vemurafenib in the proposed indication. No adverse efficacy outcome in the long-term is expected. 
There is also a limited uncertainty over the PK/PD interaction data and the food effect on the 
bioavailability of vemurafenib. The CHMP was of the opinion that further fine tuning of the food effect 
was necessary as it had not been fully investigated prior to the start of the phase III study. There are 
studies currently ongoing and data will be submitted as part of RMP measures. The uncertainties have 
been mitigated through appropriate warning and specific advice in the SmPC and were considered to 
have no impact on the positive benefit risk balance.

musculoskeletal and connective tissues. There were about 50% of the patients that experienced grade 
3 adverse events in the vemurafenib treatment. The adverse events required dose modifications in 
about 40% of the patients and about 8% of patients had to discontinue treatment. The CHMP 
considered that appropriate wording in the SmPC was sufficient to identify and minimise the safety 
risks. Approximately 20% of patients treated with vemurafenib developed squamous cell carcinoma of 
the skin (cuSCC). The applicant has put in place a risk minimisation strategy in the RMP to ensure that 
cuSCC is an identified risk which can be captured early and treated in patients that receive 
vemurafenib.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There is some uncertainty with regards to patients with hepatic impairment. Given that vemurafenib is 
metabolised by the liver, this is important missing information which is included as a warning in the 
SmPC in section 4.4 and in the RMP. There is a planned study to address this safety issue which 
deadline for submitting the clinical study report is on the 31/08/2017. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The pivotal study NO25026 has shown a clinically relevant effect of vemurafenib for overall survival 
and PFS and thus, a clinical benefit has been convincingly demonstrated. The CHMP considers that the 
clinical benefit is relevant to the proposed indication. 
The adverse events reported were adequately described and were considered acceptable. The risk for 
secondary neoplasms, such as cuSCC, exists but the magnitude of the risk is considered low. In 
addition, cuSCC can be managed in clinical practice. Appropriate wording in the SmPC and adequate 
RMP measures have been implemented.

Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial NO25026 and the supportive data from trial PLX06-02 and 
NP22657, the benefits of vemurafenib treatment in melanoma patients harbouring tumours with V600 
mutations outweighed the adverse events (rash, arthralgia, fatigue and cuSCC). Therefore, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance for vemurafenib in melanoma patients that harbour BRAF V600 
mutation is positive.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Zelboraf in the treatment of BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription.  
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Risk Management System  
The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, presented in Module 1.8.1 of the 
marketing authorisation, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the market. 
The MAH shall perform the pharmacovigilance activities detailed in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as 
agreed in version 5.0 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing 
authorisation and any subsequent updates of the RMP agreed by the CHMP. 
As per the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the 
updated RMP should be submitted at the same time as the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR). 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
 When new information is received that may impact on the current Safety Specification, 
Pharmacovigilance Plan or risk minimisation activities 
 Within 60 days of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached  
 at the request of the EMA
