2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The sought indication is in patients infected with multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. MDR HIV-1 is defined 
as those patients with HIV-1 who have phenotypic or genotypic resistance to the standard antiretroviral 
therapy drug classes: nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) or non-NRTIs 
(NNRTI), protease inhibitors (PI), and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI). MDR HIV-1 is usually 
established by at least one major resistance mutation within each drug class present in genotypic 
resistance testing, but in these patients often many resistance mutations are seen simultaneously. Upon 
virologic failure to their current antiretroviral regimen, these patients often have limited (or no) treatment 
options remaining. 
The agreed indication for Ibalizumab is its use in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment 
of adults infected with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to 
construct a suppressive antiviral regimen. 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The applicant provided the following assessment of the epidemiology of multidrug resistant HIV-1 in 
Europe: 
According to the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS 2016), there were 2.1 million people 
living with HIV in 2016 in Western/Central Europe and North America, translating to a prevalence of 0.3% 
of adults in this region or 30/10,000. According to UNAIDS estimates from 2013, where the same region 
was used to report prevalence of HIV infection, 56% of this prevalence comes from North America and 4% 
comes from Canada (UNAIDS 2016). Excluding these two populations from the prevalence calculation 
yields 840,000 people living with HIV in Western/Central Europe. The total population in this area is 
460,614,900 people. This means the prevalence rate of HIV in this area is 18.24 per 10,000 people, while 
the prevalence of MDR HIV-1 infection was estimated to be 1.131 per 10,000 people. More specifically, an 
overall prevalence of about 52,000 people with MDR HIV-1 was found out of 840,000 people living with 
HIV in the EU (6.2%).   
Out of the 52,000 people living with MDR HIV-1, Theratechnologies estimate that approximatively 5 to 
10% of these patients have limited treatment options and have immediate need for a new treatment. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of CD4+ 
T cells eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors for HIV-1 
disease progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.e. viral load). The aim of treatment of HIV-1 
infection is therefore to suppress, and subsequently maintain, the HIV-1 viral load to levels that are at 
least below the limit of detection of most commonly used assays. A detection limit of 50 copies/ml of blood 
has long been the standard.  
HIV-1 replication occurs at a high rate and this, in combination with the absence of proofreading capacity 
of the viral reverse transcriptase, results in an estimated mutation rate of approximately one nucleotide 
mutation per replicative cycle. Hence, many HIV variants are simultaneously present in each infected 
individual, which is also described as “quasispecies”. Upon antiviral drug pressure, the circulating HIV-1

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
variants most fit under this selection pressure will be able to replicate, resulting in selection of a viral 
population with reduced susceptibility to this treatment. Often, resistance to drugs in a certain ARV class 
results in cross-resistance to other drugs in that same class.   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis prognosis 
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms 
(including fever, rash, or diarrhoea), or goes without clinical symptoms. If symptoms are present, these 
generally emerge approximately 2 weeks following HIV infection. Among those presenting with 
symptoms, the number of symptoms correlates with higher pre-seroconversion peak plasma viral load. 
Diagnosis therefore most often occurs during chronic infection. Recent estimates suggest that even in 
high income settings; about 25-35% of people living with HIV starting ART have a CD4 cell count of less 
than 200 cells/mm3. In some settings, up to half of people present to care with advanced HIV disease – 
defined by WHO as having a CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 or a WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease. 
Leading causes of mortality among adults with advanced HIV disease globally include tuberculosis (TB), 
severe bacterial infections, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii 
pneumonia. 
Diagnostic tests for HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 
antibodies. 
Initial laboratory testing should include assessment of HIV staging parameters (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA) 
as well as a HIV genotype test for detection of drug resistance. The spectrum of drug resistance in an 
individual patient can range from minimal resistance that affects the activity of one or two drugs, to 
multidrug resistance that includes resistance to several drug classes. However, the risk of developing 
multidrug-resistant virus is much lower than in the past due to simpler regimens that are well tolerated.  
These regimens are therefore less likely to induce drug resistance mutations. 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for HIV-1 infection consists of a combination of 3 antiretroviral agents (ARV), from at 
least 2 different classes, and typically includes 2 NRTIs plus a third agent from the PI, NNRTI, or INSTI 
class. This treatment works well to suppress HIV-1 viral load to undetectable levels, in the far majority of 
patients. However, viral resistance to any regimen can develop, due to e.g. poor adherence, too low 
exposure due to drug interactions, or low potency of the drug.  
Patients with MDR HIV-1 have very few treatment options due to high viral resistance. When viral 
replication is not suppressed to an undetectable level, patients are at increased risk for disease 
progression, AIDS, and ultimately death. Treatment regimens in these patients typically include drugs at 
higher than standard dosages and drugs from less frequently used classes such as Fusion inhibitors and 
CCR5 antagonists. It is recommended in HIV-1 treatment guidelines that, in case of MDR HIV-1, to use at 
least 2 and preferably 3 active drugs in the new regimen and to also consider investigational agents for 
patients for whom it is not possible to construct a sustainable suppressive regimen using approved 
treatment options. 
The main goal in any HIV-1 infected patient is full virologic suppression, i.e. having HIV-1 RNA load below 
the limit of detection of most commonly used assays (often <50 copies/mL blood). If virologic 
suppression cannot be achieved, the next best is preserving immunologic function, preventing clinical 
progression, and minimizing the increasing resistance to drug classes that could potentially include newly 
developed drugs.

2.1.6 About the product 
Ibalizumab (formerly known as Hu5A8, TNX-355, and TMB-355) is a CD4 domain 2-directed humanized 
monoclonal antibody, which has been developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection. Ibalizumab binds to a conformational epitope located primarily on domain 2 of the CD4 
receptor, inhibiting HIV entry into target cells. 
The following indication and posology is agreed for ibalizumab: 
“Trogarzo, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of adults infected 
with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive 
antiviral regimen”  
The recommended dose of ibalizumab is a single loading dose of 2,000 mg followed by a maintenance 
dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks. If a maintenance dose (800 mg) of ibalizumab is missed by 3 days or 
longer beyond the scheduled dosing day, a loading dose (2,000 mg) should be administered as early as 
possible. Resume maintenance dosing (800 mg) every 2 weeks thereafter. 
Early epitope mapping studies suggested that ibalizumab binds to a conformational epitope located 
primarily in domain 2 of the extracellular portion of the CD4 receptor. Recent fine mapping studies have 
identified at least 5 amino acid residues on CD4 domain 2 and 2 residues within the C-terminus of domain 
1 that are critical to ibalizumab binding. Based on the known 3-dimensional structures of CD4, this 
epitope would be positioned on the surface of CD4 opposite the site in domain 1 that is required for CD4 
binding of the major histocompatibility complex II receptor and also for gp120 attachment. This is 
consistent with previous findings suggesting that ibalizumab does not interfere with CD4-mediated 
immune functions. The unique binding specificity of ibalizumab to domain 2 of CD4 allows the antibody to 
inhibit viral entry and fusion without causing immunosuppression. The precise mechanism by which 
ibalizumab inhibits HIV has not been completely elucidated, but it appears to interfere specifically with 
post-attachment steps required for entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells, as well as 
gp120-mediated syncytium formation (cell fusion).  
Of note, ibalizumab is a parenterally administered antiretroviral medication with infrequent dosing 
administrations (every other week). 
 
2.1.7 Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on the conclusion that there is an unmet medical 
need for patients with multidrug resistant HIV-1. Ibalizumab may be able to address (some of) this unmet 
medical need. It has a novel mechanism of action compared to currently available ARVs and has activity 
against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic viruses, seemingly regardless of existing resistance towards other 
ARVs. Therefore, it was agreed that ibalizumab may be considered a significant therapeutic innovation. 
However, during the CHMP meeting on 28 February 2019, the CHMP concluded that it was no longer 
appropriate to pursue accelerated assessment as clinical major objections still remained that could not be 
resolved within accelerated assessment timeframe and agreed on a list of outstanding issues to be 
addressed in writing and/or in an oral explanation by the applicant.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Ibalizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype 4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) for the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Ibalizumab binds to a conformational epitope 
on domain 2 of CD4, a glycoprotein receptor expressed on the surface of T-helper cells (CD4), inhibiting 
HIV-1 entry into target cells. 
The humanised monoclonal antibody ibalizumab has a molecular weight of about 150 kDa. The molecule 
has a constant region that is composed of two heavy chains of the gamma 4 subclass and two kappa light 
chains. The four chains are stabilised by multiple disulfide bonds. 
Ibalizumab is a glycoprotein and the constant region of each heavy chain has a single N-linked 
oligosaccharide chain. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls  
The active substance upstream and downstream manufacturing processes are typical for a therapeutic 
monoclonal antibody preparation.  
The upstream manufacturing process consists of thawing a vial of the cell bank, cell culture, harvest, 
purification, and formulation. The production stage of the cell culture process is in bioreactors. The 
clarified supernatant is collected.   
The downstream purification process consists of multiple types of chromatography, low pH virus 
inactivation step and neutralisation step, followed by nano-filtration (virus removal step), and 
ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UF/DF). 
Excipients are added to the concentrated product to generate formulated bulk drug substance. The 
formulated bulk drug substance is filled after filtration into the container after excipient addition. 
Sufficient information about the transfer and storage of the active substance between unit operations has 
been provided. 
Overall, detailed information has been provided on each active substance production step, including the 
pooling strategy, process parameters and in-process controls and in-process testing (IPC/IPT). 
Production scale and batch definition as well as the lot numbering system have been sufficiently 
described.

Control of materials 
Ibalizumab is produced in the mouse myeloma cell line NS0. The origin, source and history of the NS0 
host cell have been described. Summaries of adventitious safety information for biologically-sourced 
materials have been provided. 
Details of the preparation and characterisation of the expression construct have been described. The DNA 
sequence of the whole expression plasmid, including coding regions for VL and the kappa chain, was 
confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfection of the NS0 host cell line with the ibalizumab genes, selection 
and cloning procedures have been described.  
The two-tiered cell bank system was characterised based on the Guidance “Points to Consider in the 
Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use” and ICH Q5A and Q5D. No 
identifiable virus-like particles other than endogenous murine retrovirus which are not unexpected in NS0 
host cells such as intracisternal A-type retrovirus-like particles and both budding and extracellular C-type 
particles could be detected in the MCB.  
During one of the three process performance qualification (PPQ) lots, cell culture was extended for 
additional cell passages during the cell expansion stage in order to define any potential need for longer 
seed train expansion in future manufacturing. End of production cells (EOPC) testing was carried out on 
this lot in compliance with ICH Q5A. Stability of the working cell bank (WCB) and MCB will be evaluated 
throughout the lifetime of the ibalizumab product.  
Culture media are defined, and media compositions and manufacturing process have been provided.  
 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Tests and acceptance criteria for process control outputs (in-process controls and in-process testing) 
performed at critical steps identified in the manufacturing process to ensure that the process is controlled 
have been provided. 
Data demonstrated that product purity is under control during downstream processing. Controls for 
product purity by various types of chromatography are included. 
Impurity clearance by the downstream process was assessed during PPQ. Data demonstrated that the 
process-related impurities are robustly cleared, and no in-process controls are required.  
The bioburden and endotoxin sampling points, locations of filters, and hold points for the harvest and 
purification processes of the commercial ibalizumab manufacturing process were provided. Overall 
microbial contamination control of the ibalizumab manufacturing process is through a comprehensive 
control strategy which includes process control, facility control and analytical testing control. 
Product hold times were employed during PPQ. The proposed hold times for the ibalizumab active 
substance process intermediates to be used for the commercial process and any risks have been 
adequately discussed. 
An extensive list of PPs and IPC/IPT has been provided which overall demonstrate sufficient control of the 
upstream and downstream production process steps of active substance.

Process validation and/or evaluation 
Extensive information has been provided about the process performance qualification (PPQ) studies. The 
lifecycle approach is based on: 
• 
Process design, process development, and Process Characterization (PC) (Stage 1); 
• 
Process qualification of the commercial manufacturing processes (Stage 2); and 
• 
Ongoing process verification and maintenance of the commercial production (Stage 3). 
The performance qualification of the ibalizumab manufacturing process is designed to provide 
documented evidence that the manufacturing process, when operated within defined process control 
ranges, can consistently produce product meeting pre-determined acceptance criterion. Three 
consecutive batches of GMP production PPQ runs were executed to support active substance process 
validation. 
Upstream process 
The upstream process consists of five main process steps: vial thaw, subculture, adaptation stage, 
production stage and harvest. The detailed process was described in the upstream process performance 
qualification protocol and the validation documentation. All the manufacturing processes are controlled by 
maintaining the cell culture process parameters within defined ranges. 
 
Downstream process 
The active substance release testing results for active substance purity and quality are comparable to the 
reference standard or acceptance criteria. The levels of bioburden and endotoxin were less than the 
acceptance criteria. Appearance of the active substance for the three PPQ runs is colourless and slightly 
opalescent liquid.  
 
The process related residual impurities of the active substance are below the quantitation limits. At the 
active substance storage temperature, the ibalizumab active substance is free from microbial 
contamination after being stored in glass bottles for the PPQ runs. 
 
Additional studies evaluating the media hold time, and the capability of the process to remove endotoxins 
from the buffer, have been described. The potential for leachables from the materials used in 
manufacture was also studied. The short-term stability of in-process intermediates was assessed after 
storage at different temperatures. 
Protocols for chromatography resins and UF/DF membrane at-scale lifetime studies have been provided. 
The protocols for the lifetime studies / re-use for chromatography resins and UF/DF membrane, including 
the data monitoring/recording (lot number, cycle number, output) are considered appropriate.  
The in-process product purity of multiple runs was monitored. Results of several GMP active substance 
PPQ batches demonstrate consistent production when the process is run within normal operating ranges. 
The PPQ data (in addition to the process characterization/design data) support the control strategy for 
process related impurities. The active substance is routinely tested for process related impurities whilst 
process validation data show adequate clearance to acceptable low levels during the purification process.

Manufacturing process development 
The overview of the ibalizumab manufacturing process history, manufacture process development has 
been provided. Several manufacturing changes were made throughout process development. 
A summary of the quality attributes of the finished product used in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 has 
been provided. It shows that scale up resulted in minimal changes in the attributes.  
In summary, the data demonstrated that ibalizumab finished product produced from active substance 
manufactured at a larger scale had no differences from materials produced at smaller scales. 
In order to develop a formulation for further clinical use, the ibalizumab finished product was 
concentrated to 100mg/ml as three prototypes for stability testing and formulation screening. After the 
stability assessment for 100mg/ml ibalizumab prototype formulation, GMP lots of 120mg/ml ibalizumab 
finished product were successfully reformulated.  
Overall, the presented data show that the active substance from Process 1 and Process 2 are comparable. 
All Process 2 results from multiple GMP runs met lot release criteria and pre-determined comparability 
acceptance criteria. Statistical analysis of the applicable quantitative lot release data between multiple 
Process 1 GMP runs and multiple Process 2 GMP runs shows that there are no significant differences. All 
applicable compendial, qualitative and quantitative results for general properties, identity, impurities and 
adventitious agents (microbial testing) are comparable between the two processes. Characterization 
results show that the primary and higher order structures are highly consistent between the 2 processes. 
The stability profile and trending data are also comparable between the two processes based on available 
data.  
 
Characterisation 
Extensive characterisation data has been provided. The primary, secondary and higher-order structure, 
post-translational forms (e.g., glycoforms), biological activity, and purity were assessed. 
Characterisation studies were also done on materials under forced degradation conditions. The glycan 
profile of ibalizumab was also analysed. The biological activity of major charge isoforms was evaluated. 
Results indicate that all charge isoforms have very similar activity.  
No studies of the Fc-mediated effector functions of ibalizumab were performed. The absence of evidence 
for cellular toxicity in vivo in monkeys and humans administered ibalizumab is consistent with the 
expected behaviour of this IgG4 molecule.  
Forced degradation studies investigated potential degradation pathways of finished product under severe 
storage conditions: Thermal, pH, oxidation, photolysis, freeze/thaw test, agitation. Degradation was 
examined using the techniques of SEC-HPLC, CEX, CE-SDS and SDS-PAGE and compared to potency 
outcomes. Ibalizumab remains stable after agitation, oxidation and several freeze-thaw cycles. Under 
high pH and light stress conditions, impurities% was increased and potency decreased. The increases in 
the impurities% may be due to some fragmentation and aggregation. UV and thermal stress only caused 
slight changes in the analytical results. Ibalizumab can remain stable after days of agitation and several 
freeze-thaw cycles. 
Information on process-related impurities was also provided. The purity tests were conducted to 
determine host cell residual DNA, residual host cell protein, and process-related impurities. All released 
active substance lots met these specifications. The removal of process-related impurities during 
processing is supported by process validation studies.

In conclusion, complete and satisfactory characterisation data on ibalizumab active substance has been 
presented. 
 
Specification 
The proposed panel of release tests cover physicochemical tests (appearance, pH, osmolality), 
identification, quantity, purity and impurities, potency and microbial quality. In general, the panel of tests 
are in line with ICH Q6B.  
For the quantitative specifications, the release and stability data from multiple lots of active substance 
were analysed, and the 95% confidence and prediction intervals were calculated. Upon request, more 
detailed information has been provided on the statistical tools have been applied for calculation of the 
release and shelf life specifications and some acceptance criteria were either amended or better justified. 
The Applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the specifications after more manufacturing experience and 
testing data (30 batches) is obtained.  
Analytical procedures 
Summaries of method descriptions have been provided. Representative chromatograms and 
electropherograms have been provided. As per request, additional details were provided on sample 
preparation and reportable result calculations.  
Validation of analytical procedures 
Analytical procedures were validated in accordance to ICH Q2(R). It has been sufficiently demonstrated 
that the final method for the detection of HCPs is suitable. 
Batch analyses 
Comprehensive batch analysis has been provided on multiple active substance batches. The active 
substance release testing results are very consistent between the batches. 
 
Reference standards of materials 
Overall, sufficiently detailed information has been provided about the qualification/characterisation of the 
reference standards. The complete qualification of the reference standard is documented. 
A new primary reference standard was recently manufactured. An active substance Lot has been used to 
prepare a finished product clinical lot that has been used in the Phase 3 clinical study. A set of vials has 
been allocated as the primary reference material and part of the vials will be used as the 
secondary/working reference standard. The primary reference standard will be used to qualify the 
working reference standard and future primary reference materials. The working reference standard will 
be used for routine release and stability testing of commercial lots. Data showed that the Primary 
Reference Standard was comparable to the Analytical Reference Standard. 
The approach for using a two-tiered reference standard system comprising primary and 
secondary/working reference standards is considered good practice if well monitored/qualified. High level 
information has been provided about the trend monitoring and review of data to identify any significant 
change in primary/secondary reference standard quality. An appropriate re-qualification protocol, 
including acceptance criteria for all testing parameters, of the reference materials has been presented 
upon request.

Stability 
Multiple GMP substance lots were manufactured and placed on stability testing. The stability studies 
(protocols) are carried out in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. GMP substance batches 
produced according to the proposed commercial production process have been put into stability studies. 
Appropriate QAs have been tested at regular intervals in accordance with the relevant ICH guidelines. 
Overall, stability-indicating tests have been chosen which are expected to detect changes in the quality of 
the product. In general, no significant trends, if any, are discerned for all QAs tested during the storage 
period when stored under long term storage conditions. The presented data sufficiently support a 
maximum storage time at the recommended storage conditions.  
It has been substantiated that the containers used in the stability studies are representative of those 
proposed for use in commercial manufacture. 
 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Ibalizumab finished product is a sterile, preservative-free, colourless to slightly yellow, clear to slightly 
opalescent aqueous solution, with no visible particles, supplied as 200 mg of ibalizumab as active 
substance, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), L-histidine (as buffering agent), polysorbate 80 
(surfactant), sodium chloride (as tonicity agent), sucrose (as stabilizer), and water for injection (solvent). 
The product is available in a 2 ml single-dose type I glass vial with rubber stopper and an aluminium 
overseal. Each ibalizumab vial contains an overfill to ensure 200 mg of product can be withdrawn.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation development 
The formulation of the finished product is the same as the active substance. The development of the 
sterile intravenous formulation (concentrate for solution for infusion to be diluted with sodium chloride 
0.9% before administration) began at a small scale. These lots were used in Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials. 
The process was later scaled up and multiple GMP lots were used in a Phase 2b trial and in expanded 
access patients. TaiMed continued the development of a more concentrated 150 mg/mL product. 
Excipients used in the Phase 3 formulation are already present in Phase 1 and Phase 2 formulations. 
Concentration of excipients were optimized to increase the solubility and to stabilise the highly 
concentrated ibalizumab at 150 mg/ml, as well as to adjust for tonicity. 
Manufacturing process development 
The finished product process includes substance pooling, mixing, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
stoppering and capping. Differences in the finished product manufacturing process between the phase I 
and phase II material processes and the phase III material, proposed commercial process include the 
filling process.  
Three comparative studies were performed to evaluate the product quality attributes of ibalizumab 
finished product generated from different stage of manufacturing process and the results showed the 
materials generated form each stage process is not markedly different. All these materials are 
comparable and stable.

Relevant information on the process development and has been provided. The rationale for this 
classification and strategy for classification of in-process controls and process parameters has been 
described.  
 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product fill/finish process is a standard process and includes bulk substance mixing, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping. The filled finished product vials go through 100% visual 
inspection for any defects, and those vials that pass the visual inspection are then tested for release, 
labelled, packed, stored at 2-8°C and distributed. The fill/finish process consistency and quality are 
monitored by in-process control sampling of bioburden, endotoxin, periodical fill weight check and release 
testing. The process parameters and corresponding target values/ranges have been presented and 
classification of the process parameters, as well as information on how the target values/ranges have 
been set. 
Process controls 
Process parameters and in-process controls for all manufacturing steps (active substance pooling and 
mixing, pre-sterile filtration, sterile filtration, aseptic filling and stoppering, capping, and visual 
inspection) and the operational ranges/criteria have been presented. 
The classification of process parameters and in-process controls has been adequately discussed. 
Process validation / verification 
Process validation was performed on three finished product PPQ lots. The process consistency and quality 
is monitored by in-process control sampling of bioburden, endotoxin and periodical fill weight check.  
In-process samples were taken to validate the mixing efficiency and impact on finished product quality. 
Results indicated that the active substance was stable during the hold time. After holding, the product 
was sterile filtered. Bubble point testing for filter integrity was performed and all results met the criteria. 
Results for the fill weight check and parameters for filling, stoppering and capping were at target value or 
within the target range. 
Filter validation was performed with a bacterial filter retention study, leachable study and filter bubble 
point determination study. 
Three consecutive media fills were performed when the aseptic filling line was first qualified and 
periodically thereafter for various container closure configurations. All media fills passed the predefined 
criteria and growth promotion testing results met all requirements.  
A shipping validation study was performed, indicating that ibalizumab finished product can be transported 
for routine commercial shipping. 
 
Product specification

Upon request, the statistical approach has been further clarified and additional finished product lots have 
been included in the analyses to set the release and shelf life specifications. The potential presence of 
elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based approach in line with the 
ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities.   
Analytical procedures 
Summaries of method descriptions specific for the finished product have been provided. Methods also 
used for active substance are described in the active substance section. 
Validation of analytical procedures 
Verifications of all compendial methods were performed to demonstrate suitability of use, and the 
validation has been described. 
Batch analyses 
Comprehensive batch analysis has been provided on multiple finished product batches.  
As discussed for active substance specifications, also for finished product specifications the Applicant is 
recommended to re-evaluate the active substance and finished product specifications after more 
manufacturing experience (30 batches) and testing data is obtained. 
The information on references standards used for testing of the finished product is provided in the active 
substance section. 
Container closure 
The ibalizumab finished product is packaged for commercial distribution in 2mL type I glass vials sealed 
with a rubber stopper and an aluminium cap. The product contact materials have been tested to USP/EP 
requirements and shown to be suitable for parenteral pharmaceutical use. Specifications for glass vial, 
stopper and aluminium seal have been provided. Sufficient information on the container closure has been 
presented. 
Stability of the product 
Data from the ongoing long-term stability study of multiple ibalizumab injection finished product batches, 
including real time stability data at 2-8°C has been provided. Based on the presented data, a shelf life 
claim for the finished product of 3 years is acceptable when stored under the recommended storage 
conditions (2°C to 8°C, protected from light). 
The stability studies also include storage at accelerated and stressed conditions, where some degradation 
is observed. 
The stability protocols for ongoing studies and a protocol for post-approval annual stability batches have 
been provided. The stability protocols are acceptable. 
Additional stability studies such as temperature cycling (freeze-thaw study, cold-stress study), a study 
with vials in inverted position, and an in-use study have been presented. 
A microbiological challenge study and a compatibility study performed on post-diluted product in 0.9% 
normal saline solution support the proposed storage periods of the post-diluted solution of up to 24 hours 
at 2-8 °C and up to 4 hours at 25±2 °C. 
If refrigerated, allow the diluted ibalizumab solution to stand at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) for at 
least 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours prior to administration.

Adventitious agents 
A comprehensive strategy, including raw material sourcing and testing and viral clearance process 
validation, is used to ensure that the ibalizumab active substance and the resulting finished product are 
free of adventitious agents. The strategy is designed in accordance to the ICH Guideline Q5A. 
Non-viral Adventitious Agents 
Raw materials of animal origin were used in establishment of the production cell line. Human derived 
materials were also used in the establishment of the production cell line. 
There are no components directly derived from animal or human materials utilized in the master and 
working cell banks, nor in the subsequent active substance or finished product manufacturing processes. 
FBS from approved and inspected slaughter establishments has been used in the generation of the cell 
line. The provided information indicates the risk of TSE transmission via the administration of ibalizumab 
is remote.  
Viral Adventitious Agents 
Viral safety testing on the MCB and WCB that originate from the NS0 cell line was performed in 
accordance with FDA guidance “Points to Consider in the Characterization of Cell lines Used to Produce 
Biologicals” and is also in line with relevant ICH guidelines. The MCB and WCB were analysed and confirm 
to be free of adventitious agents. 
The unprocessed bulk substance produced from the NS0 cell line for three PPQ runs was tested for 
sterility, mycoplasma, virus (adventitious and species specific) and retrovirus.  
The ibalizumab substance manufacturing process uses a NS0 cell line that is known to contain rodent 
retrovirus-like particles (RVLP).  In order to generate data for the viral safety assessment the amount of 
RVLPs in the unprocessed bulk was estimated.  
A panel of model viruses was chosen for use in viral clearance studies in qualified scale-down models to 
demonstrate the ability of the downstream process to clear retrovirus, as well as to clear viruses in 
general. The purification steps investigated in the clearance validation studies included various types of 
chromatography, low pH viral inactivation, and viral filtration.  
The full study report is provided which contains details of the qualified scale down model used.  
The to-be-marketed clinical intravenous administration of ibalizumab is as a single 2000 mg i.v. loading 
dose followed by every other week administration of 800 mg i.v. ibalizumab as the chronic maintenance 
dose. The mean viral clearance factors and the manufacturing data from 3 PPQ batches were used to 
estimate the adequacy of viral clearance for both the single dose at 2000 mg and the chronic dose at 800 
mg. The viral safety of the substance was assessed based on the safety factor between the calculated 
RVLP per dose and the overall cumulative viral clearance and inactivation capacity of the downstream 
process.  
In summary, viral clearance studies have been performed in accordance with relevant ICH guidelines. The 
applied model-viruses are sufficiently justified. As expected, the NS0 cell line contains rodent retro-virus 
like particles. The applicant’s calculation of the estimated retrovirus particles per dose indicate an 
acceptable safety factor in terms of potential presence of retro-virus like particles in human doses.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the Module 3 Quality dossier presented in support of this marketing authorisation application for 
Trogarzo (ibalizumab) is of acceptable standard, with the descriptions of the manufacture and control of 
the active substance and finished product in sufficient and adequate detail. 
Active substance 
The active substance upstream and downstream manufacturing processes are typical for a therapeutic 
monoclonal antibody preparation and overall sufficiently detailed information has been provided on each 
active substance production step, including process parameters and IPC/IPT. An extensive list of PPs and 
IPC/IPT has been provided which overall demonstrates tight control of the upstream and downstream 
production process steps of the active substance. Overall, the proposed settings for PPs MOR/NOR ranges 
and IPC/IPT ranges are sufficiently supported by the process characterisation/design studies and process 
performance qualification (PPQ) runs. As per request, it has been clarified in more detail what action will 
be taken in case a pre-defined acceptance criterion for IPC is not met.  
In principle, a change to PPs should follow the current Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 (‘the 
variations Regulation’) and EU Guidelines on the details of the various categories of variations (2013/C 
223/01) as appropriate.  
In support of process validation/evaluation, there have been multiple runs in total where the in-process 
product purity was monitored. Some IPC/IPT testing is part of the ongoing process verification program 
and might be reduced or removed after completion of the ongoing process verification protocol.  
The descriptions of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of active substance 
(and finished product) are suitably detailed. 
For the quantitative specifications, the release and stability data from multiple lots of active substance 
were analysed, and the 95% confidence and prediction intervals were calculated. Upon request, more 
detailed information has been provided on the statistical tools have been applied for calculation of the 
release and shelf life specifications and some acceptance criteria were either amended or better justified. 
The Applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the specifications after more manufacturing experience and 
testing data (30 batches) is obtained.  
Finished product 
The finished product manufacturing process is a standard process for sterile pharmaceuticals and includes 
substance pooling, mixing, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and capping.  
As discussed for active substance specifications, also for finished product specifications the Applicant is 
recommended to re-evaluate the active substance and finished product specifications after more 
manufacturing experience (30 batches) and testing data is obtained. 
In general, batch release test results provided show consistency between the batches manufactured.  
The stability of the finished product is considered acceptable for 3 years when stored at 2-8°C. 
 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended one point for further investigation. 
 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Ibalizumab binds to CD4 on CD4+ cells, most likely to the BC-loop (aa121-125) between the first and the 
second domains (junction D1 and D2) on a surface opposite to the site on D1 where HIV-1 gp120 and 
human MHC class II bind. It has high affinity to CD4 with a Kd in the picomolar range of 82.2 pM. 
HIV can still bind to CD4 cells, but in the presence of ibalizumab entry into the cell is inhibited. This could 
be due to the blocking of conformational changes induced by HIV on the cell surface that are necessary for 
virus-cell fusion. 
In vitro pharmacodynamics 
In early pharmacodynamic studies, a number of HIV laboratory strains and primary isolates of patients 
were used to determine the concentration ibalizumab needed to block infection of target cells. Data from 
several studies and investigations are provided. Inhibitory action of ibalizumab against laboratory strains 
IIIB, MN, C08 and C17 show high potency with ID100 values of ≤1.0 µg/ml. The IC90 could not be 
determined for all patient primary isolates tested, in particular some Clade B isolates with macrophage 
tropic phenotype. However, IC50 was determined for most isolates, which includes strains from Clades A, 
B, C, D, E, and O which were in general very low (≤0.152 µg/ml). Ibalizumab is also active against a 
HIV-2 strain and a SIV strain. The data described so far are taken from an FDA IND filing document. This 
can therefore only be considered as supportive data. Further data is available from a study performed in 
2004, in which 6 primary isolates representing Clades B, C and D with either tropism for CCR5 or CXCR4, 
were used to determine inhibitory activity of ibalizumab. IC50 values were in the range of 0.03 – 0.07 
µg/ml.  
In vitro data from clinical trials 
Ibalizumab activity was tested against 78 Clade B clinical isolates from a phase 2a study performed in 
2006, before patients were treated. All isolates were susceptible to ibalizumab independent of co-receptor 
tropism. EC50 values ranged from 0.01 µg/ml to 0.23 µg/ml.  This is well below the lowest serum 
concentrations in humans at predose of >30 µg/mL. In an earlier phase Ib study, 17 clinical isolates were 
tested for susceptibility to ibalizumab. Although the IC50 values before treatment were low, ranging from 
0.02 to 0.16 µg/ml, after 9 weeks of treatment susceptibility reduced and the maximum percent inhibition 
(MPI) reached ranged from 32% to 79%, indicating induction of resistance. This is further discussed in the 
clinical section. Later clinical studies, performed from 2008 to 2011 (phase 2b) and 2015 to 2016 (phase 
3), showed decreases in MPI in patients with viral failure or rebound. In the phase 3 study 71% of patients 
reaching 90-100% MPI, 16% of patients reaching an MPI of 80-90%, and 13% reaching an MPI of <80% 
at Baseline. Overall, it can be concluded that ibalizumab has potent antiviral activity against diverse 
strains of HIV regardless of tropism for CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptors. 
Ibalizumab is able to block infection of target cells by free virus and by cell-cell transmission.  
In vivo pharmacodynamics 
In vivo studies have been performed in rhesus monkeys and SIV. Since it was shown in vitro that 
ibalizumab is also active against SIV, this is considered an appropriate animal model. The murine

progenitor of ibalizumab, Mu5A8, induced a reduction in viral load and increase in CD4+ cells of rhesus 
monkeys infected with SIVmac, when given 4 times at 3 mg/kg every 3 days. The humanized form of 
ibalizumab was also tested in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys. Anti-ibalizumab antibodies were produced in 
the treated monkeys, which neutralized ibalizumab, reduced exposure and inhibited efficacy. 
Nevertheless, reductions in SIV viral load were seen in the monkeys up to day 10 of treatment. 
Initial data on resistance to ibalizumab was generated in rhesus monkeys using SIV as infective agent. 
These data indicate that resistant strains of SIV readily emerge after treatment in vivo or exposure in vitro 
to ibalizumab. A similar effect is likely to occur with HIV. Further data on resistance to HIV and possible 
mechanisms are discussed in section 2.4.3. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Binding of ibalizumab or Mu5A8 on domain 2 of CD4 did not have an effect on the function of CD4 in vitro. 
In vivo, there was an expected pharmacological effect on CD4+ cell increase in monkeys treated with 
Mu5A8. No negative effect on immune function was observed in monkeys, as coating of CD4+ 
lymphocytes with Mu5A8 as a result of treatment did not cause any measurable abnormality in either 
primary or secondary immune responses. These data demonstrated that coating of CD4+ T-cells with 
Mu5A8 is not associated with loss of T-cells or with immunosuppression. 
No other secondary pharmacology studies were performed with ibalizumab. Considering the nature of the 
product and its specificity, this is agreed. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were assessed as part of the repeated dose toxicity studies in rhesus and 
cynomolgus monkeys. This is acceptable. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
In vitro data in PBMC’s shows that ibalizumab has the potential to have a synergistic effect with other 
anti-retroviral agents when tested in combination in a low passage clinical isolate, namely enfuvirtide, 
abacavir, and atazanavir. Anti-viral activity was measured as reverse transcriptase activity. In line with 
this result, a second experiment using 5 clinical isolates and measuring anti-viral activity by HIV p24 
production, showed synergy between ibalizumab and enfuvirtide. The effect of the combination 
ibalizumab and maraviroc on activity was measured in MAGI-CCR5 cells and PBMC’s, with β-galactosidase 
levels and reverse transcriptase activity as measures of antiviral activity respectively. Results show that 
the combination of ibalizumab and maraviroc is slightly synergistic, with positive synergy results for the 
HIVBal strain, but additive results for HIVADA. Patient serum also had a synergistic effect on ibalizumab 
activity. This is likely due to anti-pg120 antibodies naturally present in the serum of patients. This 
indicates that IC50 values of ibalizumab might be even lower in vivo than those determined in vitro. 
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All pharmacokinetic evaluations of intravenous ibalizumab are based on the results of one 
pharmacokinetic study, a published pharmacology study, early pharmacology studies which included 
serum levels of ibalizumab and five GLP toxicity studies of ibalizumab in monkeys (rhesus and 
cynomolgus). In addition, one study using the subcutaneous dosing route was submitted. Since this is not 
a relevant dosing route, the study is not assessed.  No specific drug disposition studies have been 
conducted with Hu5A8 in any species. 
Methods of analysis 
In the early studies in Rhesus monkeys, the concentration of hu5A8/BG9169 in plasma or serum was 
determined by (different) ELISAs. Methods are described only shortly in the study reports and no 
Medicinal Product no longer authorised
CHMP assessment report

Page 26/27
 
classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
validation results/reports are provided. The LLOQ and ULOQ of the first method are unknown. The LLOQ 
in the second method (detection of BG9169) is 124 ng/ml (ULOQ unknown).  
For the detection of ibalizumab in the 9 month repeated dose study in Cynomolgus monkey an ELISA is 
used which measures the CD4 binding activity of ibalizumab, irrespective of whether the ibalizumab 
molecules are in the bivalent or monovalent form. The LLOQ and ULOQ are reported to be 20 and 1000 
ng/ml. Pre-study validation results are reported to be conform with acceptance criteria, however, no 
validation reports are provided.  
Also in the EPPND study in Cynomolgus monkeys, ibalizumab serum concentrations were analysed using 
a validated ELISA, with an LLOQ of 10 ng/ml. Some of the validation results (calibration curve, precision 
and accuracy, incurred sample reanalysis) are provided, however, no details on for example selectivity, 
dilution and stability were included. In addition, no information on interference due to anti-ibalizumab 
antibodies is provided. 
In many of the ELISAs used to determine the concentration of ibalizumab, CD4 is used to capture or 
detect ibalizumab. However, it has been shown that anti-ibalizumab antibodies result in an abrupt loss of 
CD4 binding activity and in samples with ADA’s, the concentration of ibalizumab will probably be 
underestimated. Indeed, in many of the studies it is therefore concluded that there is significant 
interference from anti-ibalizumab antibodies and that the method is only suitable to determine the 
concentrations of ibalizumab in samples without anti-drug antibodies, i.e. only in samples <10 days after 
first dosing. This means that kinetics after repeated dosing cannot be adequately investigated with these 
assays. 
In addition, it is unclear whether the results of the different analytical methods are comparable and how 
this relates to the difference in PK results obtained in the different studies. The presence of antibodies to 
hu5A8/BG9169 in plasma or serum was in the early studies in Rhesus monkeys determined by (different) 
ELISAs. Only a short description of the methods is given and no validation reports are provided. The 
validity of these assays could therefore not be assessed. 
For the detection of anti-ibalizumab in the 9 month repeated dose study in Cynomolgus monkeys, two 
ELISAs are used; a bridging ELISA, in which all classes of immunoglobulins can be detected, and a 
sandwich ELISA, which detects only IgG antibodies. Animals were considered positive if they had at least 
1 post-dose sample which met all criteria by either ELISA and had a sample with a reportable 
anti-ibalizumab concentration at any dilution. As indicated by the applicant, both ELISA’s had limitations 
in detection of anti-ibalizumab antibodies due to the presence of endogenous ibalizumab.  
In the EPPND study, a qualitative ECL method was used for the detection of anti-ibalizumab antibodies. 
According to the report, established LPC and HPC were 169 and 5000 ng/ml in neat serum. No matrix 
interference was observed in cynomolgus monkey serum. Drug tolerance in the screening assay was 
observed at ≤ 60 µg/mL at the HPC and at ≤ 10 µg/ml for the LPC and PC 250 ng/ml. Drug tolerance 
evaluated using the PC was highly dependent on the affinity of the PC and may not have been 
representative for all study samples. 
It should be kept in mind that the presence of anti-ibalizumab antibodies may be underestimated due to 
the drug tolerance limitations of the assays. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies with ibalizumab were only performed in monkeys (Rhesus and 
Cynomolgus), because CD4 in other animal models is not recognized by Hu5A8. The pharmacokinetic 
results of day 1 following IV administration of ibalizumab are summarized in the following Table 1.

Ibalizumab showed a biphasic decline, with a rapid initial distribution phase, followed by a slow 
elimination phase. Systemic exposure of ibalizumab (AUC) increased in a supraproportional manner over 
the dose range of 5 to 25 mg/kg after a single dose (10-13x, first dose 8 week study), but more dose 
proportional over the dose range of 25 to 50 mg/kg (2.4x, first dose 9 month study). Cmax increased 
dose-proportionally over a dose range from 5-50 mg/kg. In humans, Cmax and AUC were 
dose-dependent and increased disproportionately to dose. 
Following repeated dosing in the 9 month study in cynomolgus monkeys, the total exposure (Cmax and 
AUC) was dose-dependent and AUC was increased disproportionally to dose. Accumulation ratios were 
low to moderate (2.4-3.2 for AUC for once weekly IV) and the accumulation index of trough 
concentrations was greater than that of peak concentrations. Nevertheless, due to the interference from 
ADA’s in many of the ELISA’s used to detect ibalizumab, the concentrations of ibalizumab after repeated 
dosing may be underestimated in samples with presence of ADA’s. Therefore, dose and time dependency 
could not be accurately estimated. 
Although there were some indications for a gender differences in exposure in the 8 week study in Rhesus 
monkeys (slightly higher AUC in males and slightly higher Cmax and t1/2 in females), all differences were 
<2 and no gender differences were observed in the 9 month study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Distribution 
Formal tissue distribution and protein binding studies were not conducted with ibalizumab, which is 
agreed. Consistent with the known distribution of monoclonal antibodies, ibalizumab has a low volume of

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
distribution (47-52 ml/kg), approximately the plasma volume of the monkeys, suggesting that the drug 
was largely restricted to the vasculature. 
In studies on cross reactivity, ibalizumab was shown to bind to CD4 surface molecules on lymphocytes. 
There was no evidence of inappropriate staining (cross-reactivity) of rhesus monkey tissues. 
In the EPPND study, it was shown that ibalizumab serum concentrations were comparable in postnatal 
adult females and infants, consistent with the fact that IgG4 can cross the placenta in monkeys and 
humans and is approximately 100% at full term. The data suggest that the elimination rates of ibalizumab 
in adults and infants may be similar. Ibalizumab was detectable in infant serum from BD 14 (first point of 
analysis) until BD 91. 
Excretion to milk has not been investigated. It is known that in human, IgG monoclonal antibodies are 
transferred to colostrum and milk, but only in small amounts (Hurley et al., 2013). 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies with ibalizumab were conducted in animals. The absence of metabolism studies is 
in accordance with ICH S6(R1). Ibalizumab is an IgG monoclonal antibody and monoclonal antibodies are 
metabolised to peptides and amino acids (Keizer et al., 2010). Metabolism of endogenous IgG occurs in 
plasma and in various body tissues (e.g. skin, muscle, and liver). Metabolism is via proteolysis by the 
reticuloendothelial system and by the liver, target-mediated elimination and non specific endocytosis. It 
is agreed that no metabolism studies are warranted for ibalizumab. 
Excretion 
Monoclonal antibodies are not directly excreted due to their molecular size, but are metabolised to 
peptides and amino acids that can be re-used in the body for de novo synthesis of proteins or are excreted 
by the kidney (Keizer et al., 2010). Ibalizumab will be excreted as peptides and amino acids via urine or 
the peptides and amino acids are re-used for the synthesis of proteins.  The absence of excretion studies 
is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Plasma clearance of ibalizumab was low (6.93-8.37 ml•kg/day at d1). Terminal elimination half life (t1/2) 
increased with the dose (4.8-5.6 days at 25 and 50 mg/kg after a single dose, respectively) and also 
increased after repeated dosing (up to 8.2-10.7 days after 260 days). Overall, the t1/2 was similar in 
rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys.  
Altogether, the increase of t1/2 with the dose, the accumulation of drug after repeated dosing and the 
decrease in clearance with increased dosing indicate that clearance mechanisms may become saturated 
at high doses, which is a common characteristic of monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface 
molecules, such as CD4. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is therefore degraded as other monoclonal antibodies and not 
via CYPs and Phase II enzymes, nor is a substrate for drug transporters. Therefore, no pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interactions are expected. 
Immunogenicity 
Antibodies against ibalizumab were observed in several of the rhesus and cynomolgus monkey studies, 
starting approximately 10 day after dosing, which can be expected since ibalizumab is a humanized 
antibody. It is noted that no ADA’s were observed in a chimpanzee study, a species closer to humans. 
In several of the studies, there appeared to be an inverse relationship between the anti-ibalizumab 
antibody titre and the ibalizumab concentration in serum. Also in the antigenicity study, measurable 
serum ibalizumab concentration in animals that received a 10 mg/kg initial dose, in addition to two

challenge doses, were much lower than in animals that did not receive an initial dose. Although this might 
indicate the presence of clearing antibodies, more and more ibalizumab was recovered after sample 
dilution (apparently due to the dissociation of antibody-drug complexes). This shows that the ADA’s are 
not clearing, but that they limit the adequate detection of ibalizumab in ADA positive samples. According 
to Reimann et al (1997 and 2002), anti-ibalizumab antibodies in monkeys appear to be capable of 
neutralizing binding to CD4. Since many of the ibalizumab detection assays make use of binding to CD4, 
the interference is predictable. 
Furthermore, it is noted that in the EPPND study, plasma drug levels in several animals (tested negative 
for ADA’s) were greater than assay drug tolerance (60 μg/ml at the high positive control (HPC) and 10 
μg/ml for the LPC) and therefore, the number of positive animals can be an underestimation. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Male and female rhesus monkeys treated with 30 mg/kg ibalizumab once, showed an enlarged spleen 
eight days after treatment, which was not observed at 15 days after treatment. No further changes 
effects were noted.  
Repeated intravenous exposure to ibalizumab was studied up to 2 months in rhesus monkeys and up to 
9 months in cynomolgus monkeys.  
In rhesus monkeys, peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation was decreased at the highest dose 
tested (25 mg/kg), in reaction to the mitogens Concanavalin A and pokeweed. However, after 10-week 
recovery, stimulation indices were similar or greater than baseline level responses. Germinal centres of 
secondary follicles in lymph nodes and the spleen were similar to control. In addition, as expected in an 
immunologically responsive lymph node, positive staining with IgM and IgD was observed in the marginal 
and mantle zones, showing a pattern reflecting central B-cell proliferation surrounded by resting B-cells. 
The observation of secondary follicles is suggestive of the presence of activated CD4+ T cells expressing 
the T-cell activation marker CD40L at those locations. Additional, flow cytometric data did not show any 
significant decrease in T- or B-cell populations. Also, extensive coating of CD4-bearing cells with 
complexes of ibalizumab and anti-ibalizumab antibodies may have interfered with mitogen binding, 
resulting in a transient suppression of ex vivo mitogen responses at the high dose (25 mg/kg). As 
recovery was observed of stimulation indices and other related histological clinical pathology parameters 
were not indicative of adverse changes, it’s relevance for humans is limited. 
In the 9-month study with cynomolgus monkeys, no adverse effects were observed in animals without a 
strong antibody response against ibalizumab. However, throughout the study, antibodies against 
ibalizumab were observed in 83% (10/12) and 58% (7/12) of the animals at the low and high dose (25 
and 50 mg/kg), respectively. In total, 7 animals at the low dose and 1 animal at the high dose developed 
a severe anti-drug-antibody response, resulting in lack of exposure, after which these animals were 
euthanized and necropsied around 6.5 months. Some of these animals showed clinical signs, including 
drowsiness, reduced coordination and hypersalivation. Furthermore, glomerulopathy with hyperplasia 
and hypertrophy of cells in the mesangium and increased mesangial matrix in the renal glomeruli was 
observed in these animals. Multifocal glomerulopathy was observed together with reduced albumin 
levels, which can be an indication for protein loss through the kidney. As these effects were observed only 
in animals with a strong antibody response against ibalizumab, its relevance for humans is limited. 
At the NOAEL ibalizumab exposure in cynomolgus monkeys without an anti-ibalizumab response was 
approximately 4 fold exposure at the MRHD.

A risk assessment of the carcinogenic potential of ibalizumab using a weight of evidence approach 
indicates that ibalizumab is not expected to be carcinogenic in adult patients infected with HIV-1. 
However, considering that ibalizumab is intended to be used in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products in a population with underlying  immunodeficiency, the potential risks associated with 
human oncoviruses should be addressed through clinical monitoring and post-marketing surveillance. 
Genotoxicity 
As ibalizumab is a biotechnology-derived protein product made of natural amino acids, and as per ICH 
S6(R1), genotoxicity studies are not applicable and therefore have not been conducted.  
Carcinogenicity 
A risk assessment of the carcinogenic potential of ibalizumab was done using a weight of evidence 
approach as a US FDA post-approval commitment. The conclusion of this report made by the applicant 
was that given the weight of evidence, ibalizumab is not expected to be carcinogenic. Standard 2-year 
carcinogenicity studies in rodents or 6-month studies in transgenic mice were not possible, because 
ibalizumab does not bind rodent CD4. In addition, performing a monkey toxicology study longer than 9 
months in duration would not further inform the carcinogenicity risk assessment of ibalizumab, and thus, 
use of non-human primate cells for such a study was not warranted. Therefore, the most clinically 
meaningful approach to address the potential human carcinogenicity risk of ibalizumab, including risks 
associated with human oncoviruses, was through clinical monitoring and post-marketing surveillance of 
human patients chronically administered ibalizumab. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive, no early embryonic or embryo-fetal developmental studies were performed. According 
to ICH 6 guideline, the potential maternal and developmental effects of ibalizumab in pregnant 
cynomolgus monkeys and their offspring were evaluated. 
The objectives of the pre-postnatal toxicity study, were to assess potential maternal and developmental 
effects of Ibalizumab in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys and their offspring. In pregnant females, 
ibalizumab administration resulted in statistically significant increases in CD3+/CD8+ T-cytotoxic 
lymphocyte absolute counts on GD133; with corollary changes observed in percent of cells gated. 
Increases in this cell population were not present after parturition. During the postpartum period (on 
PPD28), CD3+ T-lymphocyte absolute counts and percent of cells gated were statistically significantly 
increased in the ibalizumab-treated adult females. These increases generally recovered to within control 
ranges at PPD91. There were no ibalizumab-related alterations in absolute counts or percent of cells 
gated observed for CD3+/CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte or CD3-/CD20+ B-lymphocyte populations. In 
infants of mothers exposed to ibalizumab, statistically significant decreases were observed in infant CD3+ 
total T-lymphocytes, CD3+/CD4+ T-helper lymphocytes, and CD3-/CD20+ B lymphocytes on at least 1 of 
the measured time points (BD14 and BD28). Additionally, statistically significant increases were observed 
in infant CD3+/CD8+ T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. These values generally trended toward control ranges at 
BD28 or BD91.  
Toxicokinetics 
After repeated exposure, systemic exposure of ibalizumab increased in an approximately dose 
proportional manner over the dose range of 10 to 50 mg/kg in monkeys. Adequate exposure was 
maintained to evaluate safety in the toxicological studies. Exposure multiples (based on SS Cmax) varied 
from 4.9-19.6 for i.v. administrations. Anti-ibalizumab antibodies were measured in all studies (see 
pharmacokinetics chapter 3.7) and interfered with the ibalizumab detection assay, thereby probably 
causing an underestimation of the ibalizumab concentrations after 10 days after first exposure. E.g., in

the 9 month study, ADA’s were observed in eight animals. These animals had extremely low serum 
concentration levels of test article within hours of dosing. 
Interspecies comparison 
The pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab was studied only in monkeys (Cynomolgus and Rhesus). 
In both humans and monkeys, ibalizumab shows nonlinear pharmacokinetics, characteristic of saturable 
(capacity-limited) elimination kinetics. Following a single dose, systemic exposure of ibalizumab (AUC) 
increased in a supra-proportional manner in humans and monkeys. However, after repeated exposure, 
ibalizumab AUC increased approximately dose proportionally in monkeys. Following a single dose, plasma 
clearance was low, and decreased as the dose increased (in humans from 229 to 8.6 mL•kg/day at a dose 
of 0.3 to 25 mg/kg; in monkeys from 8.37-6.93mL•kg/day at a dose of 25-50 mg/kg). Similarly, terminal 
elimination half-life (T1/2) increased with the dose and also increased after repeated dosing. It is noted 
that terminal half-life in monkeys is much longer than in humans (in humans, terminal elimination 
half-life was increased from 1.58 (single dose) to 3.27 days (multiple doses) and from 2.67 (single dose) 
to 3.11 days (multiple doses) for 10 mg/kg once weekly and 25 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 
respectively; in monkeys, terminal elimination half-life was increased from 4.8 (SD) to 8.2 days (MD) and 
from 5.6 (SD) to 10.7 days (MD) for 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively). No relevant gender 
differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab. 
Enhanced ePPND 
An enhanced pre- and post-natal development study was performed with cynomolgus monkeys. 
Observed effects included significant increase in CD3+ total T-lymphocytes and CD3+/CD8+ T-cytotoxic 
lymphocytes in adult females. In infants CD3+/CD8+ T-cytotoxic lymphocytes were also increased, with 
a decrease in CD3+ total T-lymphocytes, CD3+/CD4+ T-Helper lymphocytes and CD3-/CD20+ 
B-lymphocytes. In general, values were going back towards control ranges at 28 or 91 days after birth. 
However, in infants the CD3+/CD4+ T-Helper lymphocytes were significantly decreased up to 91 days, 
with values comparable to control at 180 days. The NOAEL in this study for effects on development was 
110 mg/kg ibalizumab. The relevance of the decrease of CD3+/CD4+ T-Helper lymphocytes for human is 
unknown. Exposure at end of pregnancy was 8 fold exposure at the MRHD. 
Local tolerance 
Local tolerance was studied in a subcutaneous 3-week study in cynomolgus monkeys. Lymphoid 
hyperplasia in the inguinal lymph nodes was observed, which was reversible. This is consistent with a 
normal monkey immune response to an injected humanized foreign protein. Therefore, this effect is 
probably not relevant for humans. 
Tissue cross-reactivity 
No cross-reactivity to ibalizumab was observed in any human or rhesus monkey tissue tested, as only 
staining of target CD4 cells occurred. Ibalizumab stained the same rhesus monkey tissues as human 
tissues, indicating that the rhesus monkey is a relevant species for safety and tolerability evaluations. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody consisting of naturally occurring amino acids. As such it is not 
expected to have any impact on the environment.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The decrease of CD4+ T-cells in cynomolgus monkeys from BD14-91 in the ePPND study was further 
discussed. The main argument is that, although CD4+ cells in infants of treated females was temporarily 
suppressed compared to control, there was no further impact on immunocompetence of the infants. The 
relevance of this effect for human pregnancy and lactation remains unknown but as ibalizumab is a later 
line treatment option, the number of pregnant women to be treated with ibalizumab is expected to be 
very limited. In addition, the effect on CD4+ cells is transient and no functional effects on 
immunocompetence were observed. Because of this, further screening in human infants for this effect is 
not considered necessary.  
 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
There are no non-clinical major objections that would prevent granting of a marketing authorization.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All pharmacokinetic studies for ibalizumab have been conducted in patients with HIV.  Ibalizumab is 
proposed to be administered intravenously with a loading dose of 2000 mg and followed by a 800 mg dose 
every two weeks as maintenance.   
Absorption The Tmax was dose-dependent, with later Tmax at higher doses.  
Distribution The volume of distribution is about 30-50 ml/kg (i.e. 2.1 – 3.5 L), which is comparable with 
vascular space, indicating no extravascular distribution. Pooled data in a population PK analysis indicated 
a Vd of 4.8 L. 
Elimination As an IgG4 antibody, ibalizumab is expected to be cleared by catabolism and also 
target-mediated clearance (by CD4+ T cells). In the single dose study (Hu5A8.01), the elimination 
half-life increased with increasing dose (0.3 mg/kg – 25 mg/kg), from 2.7 to 64 hours (0.11 – 2.7 days). 
Overall, the elimination half-life with the proposed 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg dose is 1-3 days.  
Dose proportionality The pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab is nonlinear, likely due to binding to the 
target. Mean estimates of AUC increased more than proportionally with dose over the dose range of 0.3 
to 25 mg/kg. In the lower dose range (0.3 – 3 mg/kg), Cmax is also increased more than dose 
proportional, whereas in the higher dose range (10 – 25 mg/kg), Cmax increase is proportional to the 
dose. Clearance is decreased when dose is increased. The decrease in total clearance is expected to be 
predominantly influenced by the saturation of target-mediated elimination of ibalizumab in lower doses. 
Only a dose of 800 mg (with a single 2000 mg loading dose) is proposed for ibalizumab, therefore dose 
proportionality is not considered relevant for efficacy and safety.  
Time dependency  Ibalizumab steady-state/single dose Cmax accumulation ratio was estimated to be 
1.4 with 15 mg/kg every two weeks, this is in line with the elimination half-life (1-3 days) and every two 
weeks dose scheme. With the final dosing scheme of the single 2000 mg loading dose and 800 mg every 
two weeks no accumulation for Cmax was observed. The serum trough concentration of ibalizumab 
decreased and reached steady state after 2-3 doses of 800 mg (Figure 1). The estimated effective half-life 
of ibalizumab is 5- 8 days.

Variability Inter-individual variability of Cmax, AUC, and CL of ibalizumab is moderate to high (20 - 
50%). The intersubject variability of the serum trough concentrations in study TMB301 is about 100%. 
PK in target population All the PK studies were conducted in HIV patients. The dose of 800 mg was 
selected to achieve at least 85% CD4 occupancy. The loading dose of 2000 mg was added because in case 
of starting with a 800 mg dose, only 50% of patients achieved >85% occupancy in the 2 weeks after the 
first dose. In study TMB301, after the 2000 mg loading dose the mean Ctrough of ibalizumab was above 
30 μg/ml at steady state, and in the first 2 weeks 77% of patients had >85% occupancy, and. The 85% 
occupancy was supported by Ctrough >0.13 μg/ml.  
Special population No direct effect of hepatic or renal function on the pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab is 
expected because antibodies are in principle cleared by catabolism. No studies or analyses were 
conducted for investigating the impact in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  
No study in children has been conducted. A population pharmacokinetics analysis was conducted to 
estimate the dose in adolescent (18-12) and children (6-11). The results suggested that the adults dose 
can be given to adolescent, whereas the dose should be reduced for children (i.e. a loading dose of 1500 
mg and biweekly maintenance dose of 600 mg).  The small observed differences in exposure of 
ibalizumab in terms of gender and race can be explained by body weight. No specific study was conducted 
in elderly patients. PopPK analysis indicated that body weight was the only statistically significant 
covariate and ibalizumab concentrations decreased as body weight increased. Response rate data at the 
800 mg q2wk dose however indicate no clear effect on the % observed for a body weight of <70 kg, 70 
- 85 kg and >85 kg.  Immunogenicity is very low and only observed in the early phase of the treatment 
transiently. Therefore, immunogenicity is not expected to have a significant effect on PK of ibalizumab.    
 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is therefore degraded as other monoclonal antibodies and not 
via CYPs and Phase II enzymes, nor is a substrate for drug transporters. Therefore no pharmacokinetic 
drug-drug interactions are expected. 
 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
 
To induce antiviral activity, ibalizumab needs to bind to domain 2 of the CD4 receptor on human target 
cells. Through this binding, viral entry into the cell is inhibited via blockage of the essential 
post-attachment conformational changes in gp120 and/or the CD4 receptor, without interfering with 
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated immune functions, which requires access to 
CD4 domain 1. As binding to the CD4 receptor is the desired mechanism of action, the applicant studied 
CD4 receptor occupancy as their main pharmacodynamic target. Additionally, potential effects of 
ibalizumab binding on CD4 receptor density (i.e. the number of CD4 molecules on the cell surface) was 
studied, as well as potential viral resistance mechanisms to circumvent ibalizumab’s antiviral activity.  
CD4 receptor occupancy (RO) 
Serum CD4 receptor occupancy (RO, i.e. the proportion of total CD4 molecules on patient blood cells that 
are occupied by bound ibalizumab) and the mean percentage change from baseline in CD4 receptor

density (RD, which will be discussed in the following section) were measured in samples from clinical trials 
to determine if an association exists between these measures and virologic outcome. 
For the Phase 1a, 1b and 2a trials, CD4+ T-cell coating by ibalizumab was determined. For the Phase 2b 
and 3 trials, receptor occupancy by ibalizumab was determined using a more sensitive assay. However, 
no true validation report could be provided by the applicant. Due to the change in assays during the 
clinical development program, and given that the earlier studies investigated mg/kg doses of ibalizumab 
whereas the later studies used a fixed concentration, with actual tested concentrations varying across the 
different studies, results of the individual studies cannot be pooled and their comparability is reduced.  
From the early studies (Hu5A8.01, TNX 355.02, and TNX 355.03) it was concluded that CD4 cell coating 
was dose dependent, and that at least 3.0 mg/kg was necessary to have full coating in all patients after 
a single infusion in Hu5A8.01. In the multiple-dose study TNX 355.02, either a 10 mg/kg weekly dose 
(Arm A), or a 25 mg/kg biweekly dose (Arm C) resulted in fully coated CD4 cells, whereas a lower 
biweekly dose of 6 mg/kg (Arm B) was not enough to achieve complete coating in all patients.  
In later studies with ibalizumab provided as fixed dose regardless of weight (TMB-202 and TMB-301), RO 
was no longer dose dependent. Table 3 shows RO levels in pre-dose samples collected while on treatment 
(excluding Baseline samples) for Study TMB-202. Pre-dose samples collected at Baseline, when no 
ibalizumab was present in serum, yielded average receptor occupancy measurements of 7.7 ± 7.7% 
(range, 0 to 31%). For samples collected immediately post-dose on Day 1, when super-saturating 
concentrations of ibalizumab were present in serum (regardless of dose), the average receptor occupancy 
measurement was 97.1 ± 4.7% (range, 86 to 100%). For the purposes of this study, these data ranges 
define values for low (0 to 31%), intermediate (32 to 82%), or high (83 to 100%) levels of receptor 
occupancy.  
 
Table 3 CD4 Receptor Occupancy at Pre-Dose Trough (ITT Population, TMB-202) 
 
Both the 800 mg biweekly dose and the 2000 mg Q4W dose did not result in complete RO, in contrast to 
the 25 mg/kg biweekly dose found to result in complete coating in study TNX 355.02. Of note, the 25 
mg/kg Q2W dose in TNX-355.02 corresponds to a 2000 mg biweekly dose in an 80 kg patient, which may 
explain the higher RO levels in the earlier study. It is however not known what level of RO is needed for

optimal viral load reduction (see further below, section Relationship between plasma concentration and 
effect), and hence the implications of the observed non-complete coating, if any, are unknown.  
The number of patients with data included in table above is substantially lower than the total number of 
patients treated in this study (which was n=59 in the 800 mg q2wk group and n=54 in the 2000 mg q4wk 
group).  Due to the high number of missing data points for TMB-202 and lack of a validation report, it 
cannot be excluded that the reported RO values may be biased. 
In Study TMB-301, RO levels were measured immediately following infusion at Day 7 (Baseline), Day 21, 
Week 13, and Week 21. Additional samples were collected at Day 14, and after administration of 800-mg 
doses starting at Day 21, trough RO measurements were performed on samples collected immediately 
before dose administration at Week 5 and then every 4 weeks through Week 25. The population mean RO 
for these measurements were relatively stable throughout the study, ranging between 85%–96% 
through Week 25. 
Comparing between TMB-202 and TMB-301 studies, with the addition of the loading dose, the mean RO 
increased from 67% to 96% and percentage of subjects with RO <85% decreased from 50% to 23% at 
week 2 after the 1st dose ( Figure 2 and Figure 3). This indicates that the 2000 mg loading dose helped 
to reach 85% RO at the initial dose and to maintain high levels of receptor occupancy throughout the 
dosing period. At week 24 after the 1st dose, the RO was comparable between these two dosing 
regimens.

Relationship Between Serum Concentration and CD4 Receptor Occupancy 
In both Study TMB-202 and TMB-301 there was a correlation between serum ibalizumab concentrations 
and receptor occupancy levels. This was however not the case in the previous study (TNX 355.03), due to 
non-quantitative and unreliable results of the assay used at that time.

Figure 3 Dose-Response of CD4 Receptor Occupancy to Ibalizumab Concentrations (TMB-301) 
 
 
Curve fitting of the above depicted data produced an EC85=130 ng/mL for ibalizumab binding to CD4 on 
CD4+ T cells in patient blood. The results also indicate a general correlation between lower ibalizumab 
concentrations (i.e., <100 ng/mL) and reduced RO. The 4 outliers are, according to the applicant, due to 
unexplained technical or operational issues, but no root-cause analysis is provided. Given that RO 
analyses will not be performed in clinical practice this is accepted. However, it is advised that if RO 
analyses are envisioned to be helpful for further development in e.g. children, root-cause analysis of the 
technical or operational issues may be important. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The question then rises to what extent RO values and/or serum ibalizumab concentrations correlate with 
virologic outcome. In study TNX 355.02 a correlation between cell coating (RO) and viral load decrease 
was observed. Although the sample size of the study is small and no firm conclusions should be drawn, 
the results suggested that already partial coating of CD4 cells with ibalizumab could induce a decrease in 
HIV viral load. Of note, in study TNX 355.02, ibalizumab was given without concomitant OBR. As such, the 
(temporary, see clinical efficacy section) decrease in HIV-1 viral load seen in this study, can be fully 
attributed to ibalizumab.  
In Study TMB-202, virologic outcomes were analysed according to each patient’s average level of CD4 
receptor occupancy measured pre-dose at Weeks 2 through 24 (Table 4).

Table 4 Virologic Outcomes by CD4 Receptor Occupancy (Study TMB-202) 
 
The results suggest a somewhat worse outcome for patients in the low RO category vs patients in the 
intermediate or high RO category, although no notable differences can be observed between the last two 
categories (intermediate and high).  
Also for Study TMB-301, virologic outcomes were analysed in relation to each patient’s average level of 
CD4 receptor occupancy (Table 5) 
 
Table 5 CD4 Mean Trough RO and Virologic Responses at Week 25 (ITT-MEF, Study TMB-301) 
 
There seems to be a numerical difference in outcome (VL<50 copies/mL) between patients with a mean 
RO between Day 21 and Week 25 of <80% (1/6 (17%)) or >80% (16/34 (47%)), but not between Week 
5 and Week 25 (38% vs 44%, respectively). This seems to be due to two patients who, when including the 
RO values during the whole study, had a mean RO>80%, which subsequently decreased to <80% when

only the maintenance dose RO values were taken into account. Both patients achieved a viral load <50 
copies/ml.  
A caveat of the above analyses is that there is high inter-individual variability of viral load reduction. 
Overall, it can be concluded that there is no data to support a clear relationship between RO levels and 
virologic response. This, together with the inability to use the earlier studies due to the lack of a 
quantitative assay at the time those studies were running, the high number of missing data points for 
TMB-202, and the lack of a true validation report for the assay used in the main studies, results in the 
conclusion that RO values are not very useful for decision making.  
Absolute CD4+ T cell count and receptor density (RD) 
There was considerable inter-patient variability in absolute CD4+ T cell counts during each study. In all 
studies, absolute CD4+ T cell counts increased during the first days to weeks after ibalizumab infusions, 
which was most likely due to redistribution of cells. At day 28, absolute CD4+ T cell counts in all groups 
in Hu5A8.01 (single infusion study) returned back to baseline values. Also, in TNX 355.02, the increase in 
absolute CD4+ T cell counts was not sustained, as highest values were reached at Week 1 or 2. In TNX 
355.03, changes from Baseline in CD4+ T cell counts were modest in all treatment arms and differences 
between arms were small. 
In Studies TMB-202 and TMB-301, receptor density (RD) was measured. RD is defined as the amount of 
CD4 molecules on patient blood cells. To determine the potential effects of CD4 binding by ibalizumab on 
CD4 receptor density during Study TMB-202, the results of receptor density measurements were paired 
with the corresponding receptor occupancy results for core pharmacokinetic samples from Weeks 2 
through 24. (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4 CD4 Receptor Density at Weeks 2 Through 24 (Pre-dose Samples, Study TMB-202) 
 
 
The majority of samples with high receptor occupancy exhibited slightly reduced receptor density relative 
to Baseline (median change in receptor density = -4.1%), whereas the majority of samples with low or 
intermediate receptor occupancy exhibited no change or slightly elevated receptor density (median 
change in receptor density = 0 and 4.9%, respectively). As such, there seems to be a (weak) relation 
between CD4 receptor density and CD4 receptor occupancy, suggesting that there is some 
downregulation of CD4 molecules when the receptor is occupied.

Also in Study TMB-301, RD was measured over the course of the study to monitor CD4 receptor levels in 
response to ibalizumab treatment. The mean RD across all patients was 10%–23% below baseline levels 
from Day 14 through Week 25 (Figure 5 ). Longer-term data are unfortunately not available.

HIV-1 Viral Resistance  
Phenotypic and genotypic assessments have been conducted throughout the ibalizumab development 
program to identify potential correlates with ibalizumab treatment outcomes. The program has relied 
almost exclusively on susceptibility testing performed at Monogram Biosciences. The primary indicators 
of ibalizumab susceptibility are maximum percent inhibition (MPI), which reflects the upper plateau in 
dose-response curves observed at high drug concentrations in vitro, the inhibitor concentration at the 
midpoint of the dose-response curve (ICHalfMax), and to some extent the 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50). 
There were no virologic assessments conducted as part of the Phase 1a study (Hu5A8.01). In the Phase 
1b study TNX 355.02, samples were collected for viral resistance testing at Baseline and Week 9. Analysis 
of baseline and virologic failure viruses unambiguously showed reduced ibalizumab susceptibility at 
virologic failure. This reduced susceptibility seemed to be linked to the amount of potential N-linked 
glycosylation sites (PNGS) in variable region 5 (V5) of the Envelop protein of HIV-1. The most conserved 
positions were at amino acids 460-462 (site 1) and 464-466 (site 2), relative to the HXB2 sequence. 
Removal of site 1 PNGS clearly reduced ibalizumab susceptibility, i.e. resulted in HIV-1 clones that can 
still (to some extent) infect CD4+ cells despite ibalizumab binding to the CD4 receptor. Additional removal 
of site 2 PNGS even further reduced ibalizumab susceptibility. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the 
association between V5 glycosylation and ibalizumab susceptibility. 
The applicant concluded that the most probable explanation for ibalizumab escape is the ability of 
ibalizumab resistant HIV-1 variants to facilitate CD4 induced conformational changes in the CD4-gp120 
complex, which enables co-receptor engagement despite bound ibalizumab. The re-establishment of 
requisite conformational changes in the presence of ibalizumab may be enabled by elimination of steric 
hindrances imposed by one or more V5 glycosylation moieties.

A clinical virology report was provided for Study TMB-202, dated 29 March 2016. Twenty-five (25) 
patients experienced protocol-defined virologic failure while on blinded study medication due to 
non-response (two consecutive viral load measurements with <1 log10 reduction from Baseline). There 
was no difference between the two ibalizumab regimens, with 12/59 (20.3%) and 13/54 (24.1%) 
patients experiencing virologic failure in the 800 mg Q2W and 2000 mg Q4W groups, respectively. Five 
(5) additional patients experienced virologic rebound or breakthrough with HIV RNA ≥200 copies/ml after 
virologic suppression. Results presented in the provided report are in line with the results from the phase 
I study TNX 355.02, indicating reduced ibalizumab susceptibility at virologic failure (baseline MPI 95±7% 
(median, 97%), failure MPI 65±15% (median, 61%). The mean IC Half Max increased from 26±13 ng/ml 
(median, 23 ng/ml) at baseline to 58±32 ng/ml (median, 60 ng/ml) at virologic failure. It was again 
concluded that loss of PNGS is the primary pathway for development of ibalizumab resistance. Overall, 8 
of 12 analysed virologic failure samples lost susceptibility to one or more OBR agents that were fully 
active at Baseline. The remaining 4 of 12 virologic failure samples lost susceptibility to ibalizumab only. 
In Study TMB-301, 10 of the 40 patients (25%) experienced virologic failure or viral load rebound. One 
additional patient classified as an early discontinuation but experienced an unconfirmed viral load 
rebound after initial response. This percentage of patients with virologic failure is in line with earlier 
studies (TMB-202) and is considered significant in this rather short time frame of 25 weeks. Phenotypic 
and genotypic analyses were performed on baseline and virologic failure samples for the 10 patients. MPI 
values for the baseline isolate in each pair ranged from 55% to 99%, with a mean = 87 ± 16% 
(median=95%). Individual MPI values for the 10 virologic failure isolates ranged from 43% to 72% with 
a mean = 58±9% (median = 58%). All 10 MPI values recorded at virologic failure were numerically lower 
than the paired baseline value, except for one patient who had the same MPI value, 55, at both baseline 
and virologic failure. The phenotypic results, in general, suggest that there was a reduction in ibalizumab 
susceptibility during the course of treatment on TMB-301. Changes in HIV susceptibility to OBR agents 
were also monitored at virologic failure. Six of the 10 patients who experienced virologic failure or viral 
load rebound were administered fostemsavir as a component of their OBR. OSS calculations were 
incomplete for these patients because samples could not be tested for fostemsavir susceptibility at 
treatment failure. Excluding fostemsavir from the OSS calculation, a total of 3 patients had a lower OSS 
value at virologic failure. For the patients administered fostemsavir, none appeared to lose susceptibility 
to any other OBR agents between baseline and virologic failure/rebound. The other 4 patients all 
responded initially and failed after developing resistance to ibalizumab but without developing resistance 
to any other agents in their OBR, with the possible exception of fostemsavir for which susceptibility 
testing was unavailable.  (Table 6) 
Overall, it should be concluded that based on all resistance data provided, there is no evidence for a 
beneficial effect of continuation of ibalizumab treatment upon virologic failure. A such, it is included in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC that “If the treating physician determines there is no additional clinical benefit for 
the patient in terms of viral load reduction, discontinuation of ibalizumab treatment should be 
considered.”

Genetic differences in PD response 
Analysis of gender, race (Black, White or Others, no Asian samples were analysed) and ethnicity did not 
reveal major differences in PD responses. However, the subgroups are too small to draw firm conclusions.  
 
Mechanism of action 
Ibalizumab binds to the CD4 receptor and is believed to inhibit viral entry by blocking post-attachment 
conformational changes in gp120 and/or the CD4 receptor. CD4 is a glycoprotein receptor expressed on 
the surface of T-helper cells, and is the primary site of attachment for HIV-1. By preventing the requisite 
conformational changes, ibalizumab may, in turn, block the engagement of chemokine co-receptors, 
thereby interrupting the viral entry process. As ibalizumab binds to domain 2 of CD4, it does not interfere 
with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated immune functions, which requires access 
to CD4 domain 1. 
 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical assays were in general sufficiently validated. All pharmacokinetic studies for ibalizumab have 
been conducted in HIV patients. Ibalizumab is proposed to be administered intravenously with a loading 
dose of 2000 mg and followed by 800 mg every two weeks as maintenance dose. As ibalizumab is an 
intravenously infusion, Cmax is reached after the end infusion, with some fluctuation due to monoclonal 
antibodies adsorption to the endothelium and subsequently release into circulation.  
As expected for a large Mab, the volume of distribution is similar to vascular space (i.e. 3-6 L). It seems 
that the elimination is dose dependent due to saturable CD4 mediated clearance. For the clinically 
relevant doses, 2000 mg and 800 mg, the elimination half-life is around 1-3 days. Dose proportionality

has been shown for Cmax, whereas AUC increased more than dose proportional in the dose range of 10 
mg/kg – 25 mg/kg at both single and multiple dose level. Based on PK and PD data, CD4 in T cells is 
expected to be saturated with the dose of 10 mg/kg and higher. The effective half-life of ibalizumab is 
around 5 – 8 days. 
In the phase III efficacy and safety study, ibalizumab was administrated 800 mg every two weeks after a 
2000 mg loading dose. No accumulation is observed under these conditions. The dose was selected to 
achieve at least 85% CD4 occupancy, i.e. mean Ctrough of 126 ng/ml, in phase III study (TMB301) 
(details in PD). The loading dose of 2000 mg was added because with the loading dose 50% of the 
patients can achieve 85% occupancy in the first 2 weeks. However, considering that the method used to 
calculate the receptor occupancy is considerate not reliable and the results may be biased due to many 
missing values; conclusions on RO cannot be drawn.  
Regarding the special patient populations, the small differences in exposure of ibalizumab in terms of 
gender and race can be explained by body weight. Only 5 elderly subjects were included in the studies. 
Although there is an indication of lower trough concentrations in elderly, the lower number of patients 
prevents to draw a conclusion. PopPK analysis indicated that body weight was the only statistically 
significant covariate and ibalizumab concentrations decreased as body weight increased. Response rate 
data at the 800 mg q2wk dose however indicate no clear effect on the % observed for a body weight of 
<70 kg, 70 - 85 kg and >85 kg. The dose of ibalizumab was estimated for adolescent (18-12) and children 
(6-11) based on adult pop-PK model adjusted by CD4 count and bodyweight. However the model is not 
considered qualified for its purposes, and without paediatric data the estimated dose regimen in 
paediatric population cannot be verified. Paediatric indication is not requested in this application, thus no 
questions are raised. The immunogenicity is very low and only observed in the early phase of the 
treatment transiently. Therefore, immunogenicity is not expected to have a significant effect on PK of 
ibalizumab.  
The mechanism of action of ibalizumab relies on binding to domain 2 of the CD4 receptor on human target 
cells, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 entry into the cell via blockage of essential post-attachment conformational 
changes in gp120 and/or the CD4 receptor. Binding of ibalizumab to domain 2 of the CD4 receptor does 
not interfere with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated immune functions, which 
requires access to CD4 domain 1. 
The applicant considers CD4 receptor occupancy (RO, i.e. the proportion of total CD4 molecules on patient 
blood cells that are occupied by bound ibalizumab) as their main pharmacodynamic target. However, it 
should be concluded that there is no data to support a clear relationship between RO levels and virologic 
response. As such, it remains unclear how much CD4 coating (RO) is needed for an antiviral effect. The 
final dose regimen that was tested in the Phase III study TMB-301 was selected based on, among others, 
a target trough level of >0.3 µg/mL in order to achieve high RO levels (>80%). The PK/PD analysis 
showed that an ibalizumab serum concentration of >~100 ng/mL was sufficient to achieve RO levels of 
>80%. Significant virologic responses were however also observed for patients with mean RO levels 
<80%. As patients concomitantly received an individualised OBR in the main studies, which in itself has 
an effect on virologic outcome which differs per patient, this may explain the absence of a clear relation 
between ibalizumab receptor occupancy and virologic outcome. This however severely hampers the 
usability of any RO-based target for extrapolation to e.g. children.    
Analysis of baseline and virologic failure viruses unambiguously showed reduced ibalizumab susceptibility 
at virologic failure. This reduced susceptibility seems to be linked to the amount of potential N-linked 
glycosylation sites (PNGS) in variable region 5 (V5) of the Envelop protein of the virus. Site-directed 
mutagenesis confirmed the association between V5 glycosylation and ibalizumab susceptibility. The most 
probable explanation for ibalizumab escape is the ability of ibalizumab resistant HIV-1 variants to 
facilitate CD4 induced conformational changes in the CD4-gp120 complex, which enable co-receptor

engagement despite bound ibalizumab. The re-establishment of requisite conformational changes in the 
presence of ibalizumab may be enabled by elimination of steric hindrances imposed by one or more V5 
glycosylation moieties. 
A significant number of patients developed virologic failure in the clinical studies, 10/40 (25%) in 
TMB-301 and 25/113 (22%) in TMB-202. Viral load rebound occurred in 6 additional patients, 1 in 
TMB-301 and 5 in TMB-202, respectively. Analyses of paired samples collected at Baseline and at the time 
of virologic failure from TMB-202 and TMB- 301, showed that approximately half of the observed amino 
acid mutations represented the acquisition of new resistance-associated mutations at virologic failure. 
The far majority of patients with virologic failure lost susceptibility to one or more of the previously fully 
active OBR agents, and a clearly reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab was observed in the virologic failure 
vs. baseline samples.  A statement has been included in the SmPC to alert physicians to reconsider 
treatment with ibalizumab in case there is no additional clinical benefit for the patient in terms of viral load 
reduction and/or CD4 T-cell count preservation. 
 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of ibalizumab has been investigated to a reasonable extent. However, as 
the dose selection was recommended based on the target of 80% CD4 occupancy, considering there is no 
correlation between the % occupancy and the level of viral load reduction, it is difficult to assess whether 
the proposed doses and dose regimen of ibalizumab are optimal. 
No clear relation was observed between the proposed PD target (RO levels) and virologic response in the 
Phase 2b or Phase 3 studies. 
 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
 
The clinical development program consists of six clinical studies. Five clinical studies (2 Phase 1, 2 Phase 
2, and 1 Phase 3) were conducted in only de novo ibalizumab patients with HIV infection. In addition, an 
extension study (Study TMB-311) is ongoing. The applicant considers both TMB-301 and TMB-202 to be 
pivotal to this application. (Table 7)

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose response has been investigated in 4 clinical studies (Hu5A8.01, TNX-355.02, TNX-355.03, and 
TMB-202). The initial studies were based on weight-based dosing of ibalizumab, and included: 
- a single-dose study (Hu5A8.01) investigating 5 different doses (0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 25 mg/kg, 
respectively), 
- a double-blind study (TNX-355.02) that compared 2 dosage regimens (Arm A received 10 mg/kg 
administered weekly for 10 total doses, Arm B received a single loading dose of 10 mg/kg, followed 1 
week later by 6 mg/kg Q2W for a total of 5 maintenance doses). After these 2 cohorts had received all 
doses of ibalizumab, another 3 patients were enrolled in Arm C and each received 25 mg/kg of 
intravenous ibalizumab Q2W for 5 doses, and 
- a placebo-controlled, 3-arm study (TNX-355.03) that evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral 
activity in two ibalizumab arms (Arm A – 15 mg/kg Q2W, Arm B – 10 mg/kg weekly for 9 doses followed 
by 10 mg/kg Q2W) both in combination with a personalised OBR versus placebo plus OBR. 
From these studies, it was evident that monotherapy induced selection of viral variants with reduced 
ibalizumab susceptibility, resulting in rapid viral rebound (TNX-355.02). It also was found that 
ibalizumab, together with OBR, significantly reduced HIV-1 viral load, with no notable differences in

virologic response between the 15 mg/kg Q2W arm and the 10 mg/kg Q1W for 9 weeks, followed by 10 
mg/kg Q2W arm (TNX-355.03). 
 
During the procedure, more focus was put on study TNX-355.03 as it was considered that this study 
provides an unbiased estimate of the initial viral response to ibalizumab doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg 
compared to placebo, albeit on top of an optimized background regimen. Hence, some more information 
on this study is provided below.  
In TNX-355.03, patients were randomized to one of three arms: 
• Arm A: Alternating IV infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab and placebo, weekly for the first 9 doses 
(through the Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab every 2 weeks; or 
• Arm B: 10 mg/kg ibalizumab IV infusions weekly for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), then 
IV infusions of 10 mg/kg ibalizumab every 2 weeks; or 
• Placebo Arm: Placebo, weekly IV infusions for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), then IV 
infusions of placebo every 2 weeks Arm A. 
Patients in all three arms also received an Optimized Background Regimen (OBR). As of Week 16, patients 
in Placebo arm who experienced virologic failure had the option of receiving 15 mg/kg open-label 
ibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or switching to a new OBR. Patients in Arm A and B arm who experienced 
virologic failure had the option of switching to a new OBR. Note that OBT in the TNX-355.03 study 
documentation refers to Optimized Background Treatment, which is the same as OBR.

Based on all information provided, it should be concluded that Study TNX-355.03 provides evidence of an 
add-on effect of ibalizumab over OBR. By Week 16, i.e. prior to the possible switching of patients in the 
Placebo arm to the 15 mg/kg dose of ibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or to change in OBR for all patients, 
mean viral load decrease was 1.07 log10 copies/ml in Arm A, 1.33 log10 copies/ml in Arm B and only 0.26 
log10 copies/ml in the Placebo arm (p=0.002 vs. Arm A, p <0.001 vs. Arm B). 
The observation that twice as many patients completed the study at Week 48 without changing their OBR 
in the ibalizumab treatment arms than in the Placebo arm (13 patients in Arm A, 12 patients in Arm B and 
6 patients in Placebo) also adds to this conclusion.   
In study TMB-202, two fixed-dose regimens were tested next. Patients were randomized to receive either 
800 mg Q2W (corresponding to ~10 mg/kg in an 80 kg patient) or 2000 mg Q4W (corresponding to ~25 
mg/kg in an 80 kg patient). All patients received a personalised OBR next to the ibalizumab infusions.  
The final selected regimen to be tested in the Phase III study TMB-301 was selected based on all earlier 
studies and a target trough level of >0.3 µg/mL in order to achieve high RO levels (>80%). Please refer 
to the Pharmacodynamics section for more information as to why the appropriateness of this target is 
questionable.

Study TMB-301: A Phase 3, Single Arm, 24-Week, Multicenter Study of Ibalizumab Plus an 
Optimized Background Regimen (OBR) in Treatment-Experienced Patients Infected With 
Multi-Drug Resistant HIV-1 
Methods 
The study consisted of three periods: a control period (Days 0−6), a functional monotherapy period (Days 
7−13), and a maintenance period (Day 14−Week 25). See Figure below for a graphical representation of 
the study design. The primary evaluation of efficacy was performed at Day 14. Additional secondary 
evaluations were conducted at Week 25 (EOS).(Figure 6)

The design of this study has not been discussed with EU regulators. The applicant has had several 
discussions with FDA regarding the development program and clinical trial designs. The design of this 
pivotal study is considered fit for the purpose of showing an early effect of ibalizumab monotherapy on 
viral load, but it is not an ideal setup to determine the longer-term additional effect of ibalizumab over 
OBR alone. For this, a comparator arm receiving active OBR without ibalizumab would have been 
preferred. However, given the patient population and difficulties in selecting an OBR with enough active 
drugs, and given the results from prior studies showing that ibalizumab has antiviral activity, the chosen 
design is accepted. 
Study Participants 
The main inclusion criteria were:  
1) no AIDS-defining events in the 3 months before Screening, other than cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma or 
wasting syndrome because of HIV;  
2) a viral load > 1000 copies/mL and documented resistance to at least one ARV medication from each of 
three classes of ARV medications as measured by resistance testing;  
3) receiving a stable highly active ARV regimen for at least 8 weeks before Screening and willing to 
continue that regimen until Day 14, OR (in the past 8 weeks) had failed and was off therapy and willing 
to stay off therapy until Day 14; and  
4) full viral sensitivity/susceptibility to at least one ARV agent, other than ibalizumab, as determined by 
the Screening resistance tests (overall sensitivity score [OSS] criteria) and willing and able to be treated 
with at least one agent to which the patient’s viral isolate was fully sensitive/susceptible according to the 
Screening resistance tests as a component of OBR.  
Main exclusion criteria were: any active AIDS-defining illness per Category C conditions (other than 
cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma and wasting syndrome because of HIV); any significant diseases, acute 
illness, active infection secondary to HIV requiring acute therapy, or immunomodulating therapy.  
 
Treatments 
Ibalizumab was administered via IV infusion. For the 2000-mg doses, 10 vials were to be used, for the 
800-mg doses, 4 vials were to be used. The applicant is working on the development of a larger vial size 
of ibalizumab which is much appreciated. 
In addition to the study drug (ibalizumab), all patients received an OBR, which was a standard–of-care 
regimen selected by the Investigator on the basis of treatment history and the results of recent viral 
resistance testing. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the antiviral activity of ibalizumab at Day 14 and 
at Week 25 (end of study [EOS]). 
The secondary objectives of this study were to: 
• 
Assess the safety and tolerability of ibalizumab assessed through Week 25 (EOS) 
• 
Assess the mean change from Day 7 (Baseline) in CD4+ cell count at Week 25 (EOS) 
• 
Characterize HIV-1 sensitivity/susceptibility changes associated with protocol-defined virologic 
failure (VF) after ibalizumab administration in combination with OBR

• 
Determine the presence and significance of anti-ibalizumab antibodies, if any (immunogenicity of 
ibalizumab) 
• 
Assess CD4 receptor density and occupancy 
• 
Determine the impact of ibalizumab on quality of life (QoL) as assessed by patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) 
No formal statistical hypotheses were tested. 
Because the objective was based on both Day 14 and Week 25, for this assessment report these 
endpoints will be considered as two co-primary endpoints. The interpretation of the results will 
unfortunately be hampered due to the lack of a control arm to which the observed antiviral activity could 
be related. Secondary objectives are considered relevant and accepted. CD4 receptor density and 
occupancy, and sensitivity/susceptibility changes associated with virologic failure have been described in 
the PD section of this report. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was: 
• 
The proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 0.5 log10 decrease from Day 7 (Baseline) in viral load at 
Day 14. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
• 
Proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 0.5 log10 and 1.0 log10 decrease from Baseline (Day 7) in 
viral load at Week 25 (EOS)  
• 
Proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL and <400 copies/mL at Week 25 
(EOS)  
• 
Mean change from Day 7 (Baseline) in viral load at Day 14 and Week 25 (EOS) 
• 
Mean change from Day 7 (Baseline) in CD4+ cell count at Week 25 (EOS) 
Relevant additional endpoints included RO and RD exploratory endpoints, changes in HIV-1 
sensitivity/susceptibility, and genotypic changes in HIV-1 envelope associated with ibalizumab 
administration in combination with OBR.  
The primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving a ≥0.5 log 10 decrease in viral load after 7 days 
of treatment (at day 14), is considered relevant. The chosen strategy circumvents the interference of 
other ARVs while enabling a direct comparison with no treatment for each patient individually. As 
ibalizumab monotherapy was shown to result in viral rebound and decreased viral susceptibility rapidly 
(see study TNX 355.02), a longer than 7 days functional monotherapy period would not have been 
appropriate. A ≥0.5 log 10 decrease in 7 days can be considered proof of antiviral activity and hence the 
strategy of the applicant to compare the proportion of patients who achieve this goal during the control 
period (day 0-7) and ibalizumab monotherapy (day 7-14) is relevant. 
Statistical methods 
The two co-primary variables were analysed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which is defined as 
all patients enrolled in the study. For the primary endpoint an estimation of the considered proportion of 
patients and a belonging 95% confidence interval was calculated. The “Snapshot Approach” with regard 
to imputation of virologic failures was used and for missing data the missing equals failure (MEF) 
approach was included in the primary analyses of the two co-primary variables.

No multiplicity correction is needed, because both co-primary endpoints should show statistically 
significant proportions. 
The PC analysis could be regarded as a sensitivity analysis of the primary estimand. The PC population is 
defined as all patients who have a non-missing viral load assessment at Day 7, Day 14, and at EOS (Week 
25 or whenever the patient completed treatment).  
The McNemar test was used to compare the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 0.5 log10 decrease in the 
ibalizumab monotherapy period (Day 7- Day 13) compared to the control period (Day 0- Day 6). 
 
Study TMB-202: A Phase 2b, Randomized, Double-Blinded, 48-Week, Multicenter, 
Dose-Response Study of Ibalizumab Plus an Optimized Background Regimen in 
Treatment-Experienced Patients Infected With HIV-1 (Amended to 24-Week Study) 
Methods 
Patients were randomly allocated to one of the following two dose regimens: 
1. 800 mg of ibalizumab every 2 weeks (q2wk) plus OBR 
2. 2000 mg of ibalizumab every 4 weeks (q4wk) and placebo on the intervening 2-week period visit, 
plus OBR 
During the study, all patients received an investigator-selected OBR. The selection of the OBR was aided 
by results of a screening resistance test and review of the patient’s prior antiretroviral therapy. The 
random assignment was stratified by (a) use or non-use of a viral entry inhibitor, and (b) use or non-use 
of an integrase inhibitor in OBR. (Figure 7)

The main difference between the inclusion criteria for TMB-301 and TMB-202 is related to the virus 
sequence. While in TMB-301 patients needed to be infected with virus with documented resistance to at 
least one ARV medication from each of three classes (not further defined) of ARV medications, in TMB-202 
patients needed to be infected with virus with documented decreased susceptibility to at least one agent 
in each of the NRTI, NNRTI and PI class. Notwithstanding the notable differences as compared to the 
envisioned target population, the population enrolled in TMB-202 is considered to provide relevant 
information.   
Exclusion criteria were comparable to those listed for TMB-301.  
Treatments 
Blinded kits of ibalizumab parenteral formulation or placebo were administered via intravenous infusion at 
dose levels of 800 mg q2wk or 2000 mg q4wk for 24 weeks. As in Study TMB-301, all patients received 
an OBR, which was a standard-of-care regimen selected by the investigator prior to randomization. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study were to: 
• 
Evaluate the dose-response effectiveness of antiviral activity of the ibalizumab dose regimens at 
Week 24 in order to determine the optimal dose and regimen. The primary evaluation of 
effectiveness was based on the proportion of patients achieving undetectable viral loads at Week 
24. 
• 
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of two dose regimens of ibalizumab for dose selection 
The secondary objectives of this study were to: 
• 
Evaluate changes from Baseline in viral load, CD4+ T-cell counts, and time to loss of virologic 
response (TLOVR) 
• 
Characterize HIV-1 sensitivity/susceptibility changes associated with ibalizumab administration 
in combination with an optimized background regimen (OBR) 
• 
Determine the presence and significance of anti-ibalizumab antibodies, if any (immunogenicity of 
ibalizumab) 
• 
Assess CD4 receptor density and occupancy 
• 
Determine the impact of ibalizumab on quality of life as assessed by patient-reported outcomes 
on questionnaires 
• 
Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of two dose regimens of ibalizumab at steady state 
No formal statistical hypotheses were tested. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The key primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels below the assay 
limit (<50 copies/mL) at Week 24.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints included: Mean change from Baseline in CD4+ T-cell count at Week 
24/EOS; The time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) through Week 24; Changes in HIV-1 
sensitivity/susceptibility associated with ibalizumab administration in combination with selected OBR; 
CD4 receptor occupancy and mean percentage change from Baseline in CD4 receptor density. The later 
endpoints have been discussed in the PD section of this report.

Randomisation and blinding 
The randomisation was stratified based on the use or non-use of entry inhibitor and/or integrase 
inhibitors and was not stratified by site.  
The study was set-up as a double blind study.  
 
Statistical methods 
No formal hypotheses were tested. 
The key primary variable was analysed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which is defined as all 
patients enrolled in the study. For the key primary endpoint an estimation of the considered proportion of 
patients and a corresponding 95% confidence interval was calculated. 
The comparison of the two doses for the key primary efficacy endpoint was performed using Fisher exact 
test. To ascertain the dose level responses, a 95% confidence interval of the difference between the two 
doses was generated. The primary efficacy analysis was performed at Week 24 with missing data equals 
failure (MEF). 
The PP analysis could be regarded as a sensitivity analysis of the primary estimand. The PP population is 
a subset of the ITT population. The PP population includes all randomized patients through the last 
observed visit without major protocol violation who are considered to be sufficiently compliant (i.e. 
receiving at least 80% of the required dosage regimen and OBR per protocol, no violations of study entry 
eligibility criteria, no excluded concomitant treatment, treatment remained blinded and patient 
completed the 24 weeks treatment).

Out of the 63 patients screened, 23 were not enrolled. The main reasons for excluding patients from 
participation were due to either 1) viral load <1000 copies/ml, 2) no resistance to at least 1 drug from 3 
different ARV classes, or 3) not having at least one fully active agent.  
Baseline data 
The majority of patients in the study were white (55%), male (85%), and between 23 and 65 years of age 
(mean [SD] age: 50.5 [10.99] years). Baseline characteristics are depicted in Table 10 and Table 11. 
 
Table 10 Baseline Disease Characteristics Study TMB-301 (ITT Population) 
 
Examination of all resistance test results for patients enrolled in the study revealed extensive ARV 
resistance. Historical resistance test results were obtained for 31 of 40 enrolled patients. Resistance to at 
least one NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or integrase inhibitor (INI) was documented for 93%, 93%, 90%, and 68% of 
patients, respectively (Table 11). Resistance to all drugs in the NRTI, NNRTI, PI, or INI classes was 
documented for 65%, 65%, 63%, and 48% of patients, respectively. For these four non-EI classes of 
ARVs, overall, 85% of patients had documented resistance to all drugs from at least one class, 73% had 
resistance to all drugs from at least two classes, 50% had resistance to all drugs from at least three 
classes, and 33% had resistance to all drugs from all four classes. Five patients (13%) had documented

resistance to all approved ARVs including EIs. On average, patients were resistant to 6 of 7 NRTIs, 4 of 5 
NNRTIs, 6 of 8 PIs, 2 of 3 INIs, and 1 of 2 EIs.  
 
Table 11 Documented Resistance at Baseline (Study TMB-301) 
 
For each patient, an OBR consisting of at least one fully active ARV agent was selected by the 
Investigator. An overview of these OBRs is provided in the table below.(Table 12)

In order to estimate the activity of OBR in each patient, the combined results of susceptibility testing 
performed at Screening and patients’ historical resistance tests, where available, were used to calculate 
the OSS at Baseline. Table 13 below presents an outline of this calculation. 
 
Table 13 Overall Susceptibility Score (OSS) Calculations 
 
Baseline overall susceptibility scores (OSSs) were 0, 1, or ≥2, for 12.5%, 30%, and 57.5% of patients, 
respectively. 
The mean ibalizumab mean percentage inhibition (MPI) at Baseline was 91 ± 14%, with a median value 
of 97%. Twenty-seven samples (71%) had MPI values of 90%–100%, 6 (16%) had MPI values of 80%–
90%, and 5 (13%) had MPI values <80%. The mean ICHalfMax Fold Change was 1.2 ± 0.9, with a median 
of 0.9.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population included all 40 patients enrolled in the study. The PC population included all patients 
who had a non-missing viral load assessment at Day 7, Day 14, and Week 25 (EOS) and included 26 
patients (65%),(Table 14)  
 
Table 14 Data Sets Analysed (Study TMB-301)   
 
Fourteen subjects (35%) were not included in the Protocol correct population as they had viral load data 
missing at Day 7, Day 14, or EOS (Week 25). For 9 of the 14 this was because they did not complete the 
study and therefore had no viral load value at Week 25/EOS. The remaining 5 subjects experienced 
virologic failure and were therefore excluded from the Protocol correct population, even though they did 
have viral load data reported at the requested timepoints and it was not pre-specified that these subjects 
should be excluded from the PC.  
Of note, the main conclusions will be based on the outcomes of all 40 enrolled subjects.

The observed ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load after the first ibalizumab infusion in 33/40 (82.5%) of 
patients, compared to 1/40 (2.5%) with a spontaneous ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load in the week prior 
to infusion, can be considered proof of an antiviral effect of ibalizumab. The seven patients without a ≥0.5 
log10 decrease in viral load do not seem to differ from the 33 patients with a ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral 
load in baseline characteristics such as viral load or CD4+ T cell counts. The applicant states that there 
was no relation with susceptibility to ibalizumab or receptor occupancy/density levels that may explain 
this outcome, which can also be seen in the table below (Table 16)

All patients had high serum concentrations and CD4 receptor occupancy at Day 14, so drug exposure was 
also not a factor in nonresponse. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Mean Change from Baseline (Day 7) in Viral Load at Day 14 and Week 25 (EOS) 
Mean HIV-1 RNA in the ITT-MEF population was 100,287.1 copies/mL at Baseline, decreasing to 24,076.1 
copies/ml at Day 14 (change of -76,211.0 copies/ml), reaching a nadir of 13,230.5 copies/ml at Day 21

(change of -87,056.7 copies/ml). Levels increased only slightly at Week 5, remaining low (mean ≤24,000 
copies/ml) throughout the study. The mean HIV-1 RNA value at Week 25 (EOS) was 32,935.6 copies/ml. 
The proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 0.5 log10 decrease from baseline at Week 25/EOS was found 
statistically significantly different from Control period (Day 0 to Day 6) at Week 25/EOS (62.5% with 95% 
CI (45.8%,77.3%) and are considered clinically relevant, refer to Table 17. For the PC population these 
results were 96.2% with 95% CI (80.4%,99.9%) at Week 25/EOS.  
 
Proportion of Patients with HIV-1 RNA Levels <50 copies/ml and <400 copies/ml at Week 25 (EOS)

There is a trend towards increasing virologic responses with increasing OSS values (Table 18) which is not 
unexpected in HIV treatment.

(Week 25 Analysis) 
 
Mean Change from Baseline (Day 7) in CD4+ Cell Counts at Week 25 (EOS) 
Mean CD4+ cell counts at Baseline (Day 7) were <200 cells/mm3 for both the ITT and PC populations. 
Mean CD4+ cell counts showed increases from Baseline at each scheduled time point during the study 
peaking at Week 21 for both the ITT and PC populations. Mean CD4+ cell count at Week 21 was 248.3 
cells/mm3 for the ITT population (n=29) and 267.4 cells/mm3 for the PC population (n=23).

The observed increase in mean CD4+ T cell counts from 150 to 240 cells/mm3 is considered clinically 
relevant. Of note, Week 25 data was only available for 27 patients.  
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis have been performed by geographic location (United States vs. Taiwan), sex 
(male/female), age (<50 vs. ≥50), race (Caucasian, Asian, and Other), and concomitant fostemsavir use 
(yes/no). None of these factors had a relevant impact on the proportion of patients with ≥0.5 log10 
decrease from Baseline (Day 7) in viral load at Day 14.  
The virologic response (log10 reduction, proportion of patients that achieved RNA levels <50 copies/mL 
and <200 copies/mL in HIV-1 RNA) at Week 25 by CD4+ cell counts, viral load, OSS, and resistance to 
integrase inhibitors at Baseline in the ITT population is presented in Table 19.

Numbers analysed 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients. Patients were counted in the 
treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of whether they received any dose of study 
medication. 
The per protocol (PP) population was a subset of the ITT population and included all randomized patients 
through the last observed visit without major protocol violation who were considered to be sufficiently 
compliant with the protocol (i.e. receiving at least 80% of the required dosage regimen and OBR per 
protocol, no violations of study entry eligibility criteria, no excluded concomitant treatment, treatment 
remained blinded and patient completed the 24 weeks treatment).  
As can be seen in Table 22, 23 subjects (20%) were not included in the per protocol population, with a 
numerical difference between the two treatments arms (9/59 (15%) vs 14/54 (26%)).

34.3%, 59.3%, 52.9%, and 0, respectively; p=0.0000) 
• 
patients with a baseline viral load <100,000 copies/ml, n=78 and patients with a baseline viral 
load ≥100,000 copies/ml, n=35 (41.0% [51.2% for the 800 mg q2wk treatment group and

Age, weight, and type of agents included in the OBR did not appear to have an effect on response rate 
(with response defined as achieving a viral load<50 copies/ml) at Week 24. 
As also seen in TMB-301, there is a clear trend that those patients that are most severely affected by their 
HIV-1 infection (i.e. those with low CD4 counts and/or high viral load) responded less well in this study. 
Patients with good adherence to OBR, an intermediate to high CD4 RO rate and/or an OSS score ≥2, in 
contrast, responded clearly better. The observed differences in outcome between male and female 
patients, as well as between white and other patients, are less straightforward and more likely to be due 
to change or interference with one or more of the above described factors that seem to influence 
treatment outcome.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The provided comparison of results across studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 suggested that the percentage 
of patients with a viral load <50 copies/ml at End of Study was similar for the 800 mg Q2W maintenance 
dose in Study TMB-301 (42.5%) and the 800 mg Q2W group in Study TMB-202 (44.1%). The percentage 
for the 2000 mg Q4W group, in Study TMB-202, was numerically lower (27.8%) (Table 27). A similar 
pattern was observed for the proportion of patients with a viral load <400 copies/ml at End of Study. 
Table 27 Proportion of Patients with HIV-1 RNA Levels <50 Copies/mL and <400 Copies/mL 
at End of Study (Study TMB-301 and Study TMB-202, Intent-to- Treat Population) 
 
The proportion of patients with a ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load from baseline to End of Study was 
similar for the 800 Q2W maintenance dose in Study TMB-301 (62.5%) and the 800 mg Q2W group in 
Study TMB-202 (67.8%). The percentage for the 2000 mg Q4W group in Study TMB-202 was 59.3%. The 
mean change in viral load from baseline to End of Study was -1.5 to -1.64 log10 copies/mL across the 
three treatment groups in Study TMB-301 and Study TMB-202.  
Mean HIV-1 RNA viral loads decreased rapidly after the initial infusion of ibalizumab and reached a nadir 
after approximately 4 weeks on treatment (Figure 9). Mean viral loads increased slightly during Weeks 8 
through 24, but remained at least 1.5 log10 copies/ml below the baseline mean.

Supportive studies  
Starting in October 2009, patients who completed ibalizumab treatment in Study TMB-202 (Amendment 
2) and who had a significant viral load response were permitted to continue to receive ibalizumab via an 
Investigator-sponsored protocol. The purpose of the protocol was to extend the successful treatment for 
patients beyond the endpoints provided by Study TMB-202. 
Additional patients who had never participated in Study TMB-202, but who qualified to receive 
ibalizumab, were also enrolled and treated (also under Investigator-Sponsored INDs).

The objectives of this Investigator-sponsored study were to: 
• 
Continue to provide ibalizumab to patients currently receiving ibalizumab treatment 
• 
Demonstrate the longer term safety and tolerability of ibalizumab in treatment-experienced 
HIV-positive patients 
• 
Provide access to ibalizumab for heavily treatment-experienced HIV-positive patients with limited 
treatment options 
Efficacy was not the primary purpose of this Investigator-sponsored IND protocol and was not formally 
assessed. However, as part of an evaluation of continued eligibility under the protocol, viral load 
measurements (HIV-1 RNA) were assessed. As per the protocol, patients who experienced VF were to be 
discontinued. VF was defined per the protocol as two consecutive HIV-1 RNA level measurements, at least 
14 days apart, that were above the limit of detection at or beyond Week 24 or two consecutive HIV-1 RNA 
level measurements, at least 14 days apart, that were <1 log10 decline from Baseline at or beyond Week 
16, or completion of Study TMB 202. Thus, the proportion of patients achieving / maintaining a ≥0.7 
log10 decrease from baseline in viral load was used to determine effectiveness.

The study ran between 2009 and 2015. Although no formal efficacy analysis has been done, it can be 
concluded that a significant number of patients experienced virologic failure (12/57 (21%)) or switched to 
an alternative regimen (5/57 (8.8%)) which is most likely also related to virologic failure. From the 
patients, not previously enrolled in TMB-202, almost half (3/7 (42.9%)) experienced virologic failure. 
Time from start of treatment (either in TMB-202 or in the IND) to discontinuation by discontinuation 
reason as listed in Table 30 were provided as well as time to discontinuation analyses. 
TMB-311 is an ongoing multicentre expanded access study of ibalizumab plus an OBR in 
treatment-experienced patients infected with MDR HIV-1. The study consists of 2 cohorts and includes 
patients already receiving ibalizumab treatment in other studies (rolling over from Studies TMB-301 and 
TMB-202), as well as compassionate use [Cohort 1], and new patients who are naïve to ibalizumab 
treatment [Cohort 2]. Cohort 1 patients continued on their current dosage of ibalizumab (800 mg q2wk or 
2000 mg q4wk). Cohort 2 patients receive a 2000 mg loading dose at Baseline/Day 0 followed by 800 mg 
maintenance doses every 2 weeks. In addition to ibalizumab, all patients receive an OBR, which is a 
standard-of-care regimen selected by the investigator based on treatment history and the results of viral 
resistance testing. 
Enrolment in Cohort 1 closed on 24 July 2017 and enrolment for Cohort 2 closed on 5 April 2018. A high 
level summary of initial results is provided below.  
When looking at the 27 patients who rolled over from TMB-301 to Study TMB-311 [Cohort 1], 18/27 
(66.6%) achieved a ≥0.5 log10 decrease from baseline in VL at Week 48. Six (6) patients discontinued 
the efficacy portion of the study because of virologic failure, but continued for the safety part. The 
remaining patients either had a <0.5 log10 decrease in VL (n=2) or discontinued for other reasons with 
a ≥0.5 log10 decrease from baseline in VL (n=1).  
The proportion of patients achieving HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/ml and <400 copies/ml at Day 7, Week 
12, Week 24, and Week 48 is summarized for Cohort 2 patients in Table 31.

It is appreciated that a relevant proportion of patients was able to achieve a reduced viral load upon 
receiving ibalizumab infusions, which in some cases was sustained until at least 48 weeks of treatment. 
 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan of ibalizumab relies mainly on two studies, the Phase III study TMB-301 and 
the Phase II study TMB-202. Of the latter study, especially the 800 mg given every other week (Q2W) arm 
is of interest, as this resembles the maintenance dose as currently suggested in the SmPC. The posology 
as recommended in the SmPC, starting with a 2000 mg loading dose which is followed by a 800 mg Q2W 
maintenance dose, was however only studied in the 40 patients enrolled in Study TMB-301.   
Dose selection 
Initial studies with ibalizumab were based on a mg/kg dosage strategy. After a first dose-escalation 
study, it was found that a single dose of at least 10 mg/kg resulted in complete coating of CD4 cells (see 
also pharmacodynamics discussion) and was able to temporarily reduce HIV-1 viral load. The next two 
studies investigated ibalizumab given either weekly (Q1W) or biweekly (Q2W) in several concentrations 
and either as functional monotherapy (TMB-355.02) or together with an active OBR (TMB-355.03). From 
these studies, it was evident that monotherapy induced selection of viral variants with reduced ibalizumab 
susceptibility, resulting in rapid viral rebound. It also was found that ibalizumab, together with OBR, 
significantly reduced HIV-1 viral load, with no notable differences in virologic response between the 15 
mg/kg Q2W arm (arm A) and the 10 mg/kg Q1W for 9 weeks, followed by 10 mg/kg Q2W arm (arm B). 
By Week 16, i.e. prior to the possible switching of patients in the Placebo arm to the 15 mg/kg dose of 
ibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or to change in OBR for all patients, mean viral load decrease was 1.07 
log10 copies/mL in Arm A, 1.33 log10 copies/mL in Arm B and only 0.26 log10 copies/ml in the Placebo 
arm. The applicant concluded that a serum ibalizumab concentration of >5 µg/ml was associated with 
high CD4 receptor coating of T cells and generally correlated with significant viral RNA suppression, and 
hence aimed to next study a fixed-dose regimen that was predicted to achieve the desired trough level of 
>5 µg/ml. The weight-based dosages used in the dose-finding studies were subsequently replaced with a 
fixed-dose regimen because, as the applicant states, body weight is not known to correlate well with the 
number of CD4+ T-cells, CD4 receptors, or the rate of CD4+ T-cell turnover.

In study TMB-202, two regimens were tested, patients were randomized to receive either 800 mg Q2W 
(corresponding to ~10 mg/kg in an 80 kg patient) or 2000 mg Q4W (corresponding to ~25 mg/kg in an 
80 kg patient). All patients received a personalised OBR next to the ibalizumab infusions. Based on all 
available information, the applicant finally concluded that patients with serum concentrations below a 
certain threshold, i.e. 0.15 μg/ml, during the course of ibalizumab treatment had a lower virologic 
response – specifically the viral load reduction from Baseline. In patients whose serum concentrations are 
always maintained above 0.15 μg/ml, no relationship was observed between serum concentrations and 
virologic outcomes. In TMB-202, the Ctrough serum concentrations in the 2000 mg dose every 4 weeks 
arm dipped to levels very close to the limit of 0.15 μg/ml, yet still above that value. The median Ctrough 
levels in the 800 mg dose at Week 2 were also very close to the 0.15 μg/ml threshold. The observation 
that the 2000 mg every 4 weeks arm provided better efficacy at Week 2, likely due to higher exposure 
achieved by the higher dose at Week 2, while the 800 mg every 2 weeks demonstrated better efficacy at 
Week 24, likely due to the higher Ctrough maintained throughout the trial period as a result of the shorter 
dosing interval, resulted in the final recommendation of a 2000 mg loading dose followed by 800 mg Q2W 
which was tested in the Phase III study TMB-301. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study TMB-301 was a Phase III, single-arm, multicentre, open-label study, consisting of a control period 
(days 0-6) in which patients were monitored on current failing therapy (or no therapy), a functional 
ibalizumab monotherapy period (days 7-13) and a maintenance period during which patients received 
OBR next to ibalizumab infusions (day 14-week 25). The design of the study has not been discussed with 
EU regulators. The applicant has had discussions with FDA regarding the development program and 
clinical trial designs. The design of this pivotal study is considered fit for the purpose of showing an early 
effect of ibalizumab monotherapy on viral load, but it is not designed to determine the (longer-term) 
additional effect of ibalizumab over OBR alone. For this, a comparator arm receiving active OBR without 
ibalizumab would have been needed. However, given the patient population and difficulties in selecting an 
OBR with enough active drugs, and given the results from prior studies showing that ibalizumab has 
antiviral activity, the chosen design is accepted. 
Study TMB-202 was a Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, multicentre, 24-week, dose-response study. 
As both arms received ibalizumab (albeit in different regimens) in this study, no real comparison can be 
made with other treatments to put the observed virologic outcome data into perspective.  
For study TMB-301, the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a ≥0.5 log 10 decrease in 
viral load during 7 days of treatment, is considered relevant. The chosen strategy circumvents the 
interference of other ARVs while enabling a direct comparison with no or failed treatment for each patient 
individually. As ibalizumab monotherapy was shown to result in viral rebound and decreased viral 
susceptibility rapidly (see study TNX 355.02), a longer than 7 days functional monotherapy period would 
not have been appropriate. A ≥0.5 log 10 decrease in 7 days can be considered proof of antiviral activity 
and hence the strategy of the applicant to compare the proportion of patients who achieve this goal during 
the control period (day 0-6) and ibalizumab monotherapy (day 7-14) is relevant. Of note, given that the 
primary objective was to demonstrate antiviral activity at Day 14 and at Week 25, also the week 25 
results are considered important for study success.  
The primary endpoint for study TMB-202 was the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA levels <50 
copies/mL at week 24, which is a widely used and accepted endpoint in studies investigating HIV 
antiretroviral therapy.  
Secondary objectives and endpoints (such as Mean change from baseline in viral load, CD4 count and 
ibalizumab susceptibility at Week 25/EOS) in both studies are also considered of relevance and 
appropriate.

Patient population 
Given the limitations of available data on efficacy and safety (see further below for more details), 
ibalizumab should only be used in patients who are unlikely to achieve virological suppression with 
presently available agents. The applicant reworded the proposed indication accordingly. 
There are several uncertainties that may impact the level of benefit that has been shown (most 
importantly the small number of patients treated, the very different OBRs that have been given 
concomitantly, and the rather short follow-up period). The patients treated in study TMB-202 are not 
considered to be directly comparable to the population that may be treated after marketing authorisation. 
The study ran between 2008 and 2011, which is quite long ago, and the current treatment options are 
substantially different from what was available in 2008. The entry inhibitors enfuvirtide and maraviroc 
were already in clinical use and the first-in-class integrase inhibitor raltegravir had been recently 
approved at that time, but elvitegravir, dolutegravir and bictegravir (with improved tolerability and higher 
barriers to resistance) were not yet available, nor were boosted PIs (given that cobicistat and ritonavir 
were not yet approved) part of the treatment options. No information on prior ARV use could be located 
in the CSR of Study TMB-202.  
Of importance is also that while in TMB-202 patients eligible for enrolment needed to be infected with 
virus with documented decreased susceptibility to at least one agent in each of the NRTI, NNRTI and PI 
class, in the currently proposed indication (correctly reflected in the inclusion criteria of study TMB-301) 
patients need to be infected with virus with documented resistance to at least one ARV medication from 
each of three classes of ARV medications. It can be questioned where decreased susceptibility ends and 
resistance begins, and to what extent these populations can both be considered supportive for the 
claimed indication (in which resistance to at least 1 agent in 3 different classes is required) or are 
essentially different. Even though there are notable differences between the trial population of Study 
TMB-202 and the envisioned target population, it is agreed with the applicant that the population enrolled 
in TMB-202 provides relevant information.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In both studies, a significant proportion of screened patients were not enrolled in the study (36.5% in 
study TMB-301 and 43% in study TMB-202, respectively). Main reasons for screen failures were 1) viral 
load <1000 copies/mL, 2) no resistance to at least 1 drug from 3 different ARV classes, or 3) not having 
at least one fully active agent. 
Study TMB-301 
From earlier studies, it was shown that ibalizumab has antiviral efficacy. This was further confirmed in 
study TMB-301, where the 2000 mg loading dose, given without any other active antiretroviral therapy, 
resulted in significant viral load decrease (≥0.5 log10) between days 7 to 14 in 33 out of 40 patients 
(82.5%), compared to 1 out of 40 (2.5%) patients who achieved this goal during the initial 7 days. The 
seven patients without a ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load do not seem to differ from the 33 patients with 
a ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load in baseline characteristics such as viral load or CD4+ T cell counts. The 
applicant stated that there was no relation with susceptibility to ibalizumab or receptor occupancy/density 
levels that may explain this outcome. All patients had high serum concentrations and CD4 receptor 
occupancy at Day 14, so drug exposure was also not a factor in nonresponse. As also the co-primary 
endpoint (≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load at Week 25) was found statistically significantly different from 
zero, the study can be considered successful.  
After day 14, patients received an OBR together with ibalizumab. Mean HIV-1 RNA levels further 
decreased with a nadir at day 21, after which these levels slightly increased again. At end of study (week 
25), mean HIV-1 RNA levels were approximately one third of baseline levels. While the effect of 
ibalizumab in reducing viral load during the 7 day monotherapy period is clear and appreciated, it is

unknown what part of the effect between day 14 and end of study can be attributed to ibalizumab and 
what part to the OBR.  
There was a clear trend toward increasing virologic responses with increasing OSS values, which is typical 
for HIV treatment studies, as stated by the applicant. To gain further insight in the contribution of OBR, 
a thorough investigation around the number and type of active ARVs in the OBR for each individual patient 
in relation to virologic outcome considered needed in order to reveal if there is evidence of an added value 
of ibalizumab over OBR alone. Per individual patient, the likely activity of the OBR was analysed based on 
the mutations in the patient’s viral sequences and the Stanford HIV drug resistance database 
(https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/). The patient’s virologic response during the study was 
then carefully reviewed. Given that there were some patients for whom it was very unlikely that the 
outcome would have been reached solely based on the predicted activity of the OBR, and given the 
significant viral load decrease observed upon ibalizumab monotherapy between days 7 to 14 in the far 
majority of patients, it was considered that there is a clear suggestion of an added effect of ibalizumab on 
top of the OBR. Of note, all patients for whom this was applicable, had an OSS score of 0 or 1. Hence, it 
is considered justified to support approval of ibalizumab, in a restricted population of adults infected with 
multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive 
antiviral regimen. The applicant has committed to set-up a prospective product registry and perform a 
post-authorization study to provide more evidence that ibalizumab has additional efficacy on top of OBR 
in patients suffering from multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection. 
 
Table 32 Overview of individual patient’s OBR and virologic outcome 
 
Mean CD4+ T cell counts increased during the study from 150 cells/mm3 at baseline to 208 cells/mm3 at 
week 25, which is considered clinically relevant. There is however a quite extensive proportion of missing 
data at week 25 (15%), which may have an impact on this outcome.  
Efficacy results stratified by CD4 cells show a low response rate in patients with a CD4 count below 
50/mm3. Given the ibalizumab CD4-dependent mechanism of action and the intended advanced target 
population, this aspect is required to be highlighted in the SmPC.

There does not seem to be a difference in outcome by sex (male/female), age (<50 vs. ≥50), race 
(Caucasian, Asian, and Other), and geographic location (United States vs. Taiwan), although the 
single-arm design and small patient numbers do not allow any confirmatory conclusions. 
Subjects treated with fostemsavir seemed to perform worse compared to those who did not receive the 
investigational agent. This could have been due to more advanced HIV disease and lower average OSS in 
these patients. Use of the investigational agent fostemsavir as a component of the OBR in TMB-301 was 
assigned a score of ‘1’ for OSS calculations, assuming it was fully active, unless susceptibility results were 
provided by sites that indicated reduced susceptibility to fostemsavir.  
 
Study TMB-202 
The primary endpoint of Study TMB-202, the proportion of patients having a viral load of <50 copies/ml 
at Week 24, was 26/59 (44.1%) in the 800 mg Q2W arm and 15/54 (27.8%) in the 2000 mg Q4W arm. 
Although the difference between the two treatment regimens was not statistically significant, there was a 
numerical difference in favour of the 800mg q2wk regimen. Although cross-study comparisons need to be 
interpreted with much caution, the observed proportion of patients having a viral load of <50 copies/ml 
at Week 24 (44%) was very much comparable to what is observed in study TMB-301 (42%). Secondary 
endpoint analyses were in line with the primary analysis, and the provided subgroup analyses did not 
reveal new insights.  
Expanded access study TMB-311 
Patients who received ibalizumab under the TMB-301 or TMB-202 protocol were eligible to roll-over to the 
expanded access study TMB-311 (cohort 1). Also, a cohort of ibalizumab naïve patients was enrolled 
under the TMB-311 protocol (cohort 2). A post-hoc analysis was provided for the patients enrolled in 
Study TMB-301 at US sites (n=36), with a data cut-off date of 20 April 2017. A draft summary report on 
the 39 patients in Cohort 2 was provided, with a cut-off date of 31 March 2018.  
The submitted Cohort 1 data provide reassurance regarding the longer-term effect of ibalizumab, with 18 
of the 27 patients who actually rolled over from the parent study to Study TMB-311 (66.6%) having 
achieved a ≥0.5 log10 decrease from baseline in VL at Week 48, and 16 of the 27 patients (59.3%) having 
achieved virologic suppression (i.e. suppress to <50 copies at any time after primary endpoint while not 
having a ≥1 log10 increase from nadir on any two consecutive scheduled efficacy assessments after 
achieving the ≥0.5 log10 decline from Baseline).  
It should be noted that assessment of Cohort 2 data is currently not possible given the limited information 
provided. Especially in depth assessment of patient characteristics was not possible, which hampers 
interpretation of any efficacy outcome. However, it is appreciated that a relevant proportion of patients 
was able to achieve a reduced viral load upon receiving ibalizumab infusions, some of which was 
sustained until at least 48 weeks of treatment. 
The chosen fixed-dose regimen raises concerns of possible under-dosing of ibalizumab in patients with 
high body weight. In study TMB-202 and TMB-301, patients with higher body weight showed lower drug 
trough concentration when compared to those with less high body weight. Further, in the TMB-202 
ibalizumab 800 mg Q2W arm, average trough concentrations in patients with high body weight were far 
below 300 ng/ml, which is considered the threshold necessary to obtain intermediate or high CD4+ 
receptor occupancy. PopPK analysis indicated that body weight was the only statistically significant 
covariate and ibalizumab concentrations decreased as body weight increased. Response rate data at the 
800 mg q2wk dose however indicate no clear effect on the % observed for a body weight of <70 kg, 70 
- 85 kg and >85 kg. However, the lower drug trough concentrations are unlikely to impact virologic 
outcome and does not warrant a dose adjustment.

Additional expert consultation 
During the CHMP meeting on 28 February 2019, the CHMP concluded that a SAG shall be convened. 
This SAG meeting was held on 11 April 2019.  
The following questions were discussed regarding efficacy: 
1. What is the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 in the EU, such that the availability of an 
agent like ibalizumab might be relevant to achieve durable viral suppression? 
It is acknowledged that, currently, the percentages of patients with MDR HIV in the European countries 
are below 3-5%. It is however further pointed out that the target population for this product would be 
mainly the MDR HIV patients who have detectable viral load and therefore those who experience 
virological failure. In this last scenario, the estimated prevalence at the moment is definitely below 1%, 
however, it is considered an unmet need as these patients have limited therapeutic options with higher 
risk of disease progression, and are in need of new therapies such as ibalizumab.  The role of adherence 
and the availability of other medicines to build an effective treatment were also discussed: 
• 
Adherence is always a key point to obtain undetectable viral load and in this case it seems 
even more important as the patients have to be willing to attend the Clinic frequently 
because the administration is intravenous. 
• 
The availability of other therapeutics for the OBR in addition to Ibalizumab to achieve the 
virological suppression and therefore to improve their immunovirological situation must 
be also considered since those who have an overall susceptibility score (OSS) of ≤ 1 
could have more risk of virological failure. 
 
*OSS: Overall susceptibility score is defined as the number of fully active antiretroviral in the OBR 
established at baseline based on Monogram’s genotypic and phenotypic test results and historical results. 
In conclusion, although the target population for this drug is small, still it is considered an unmet need for 
patients with MDR HIV-1 infection who had advanced disease and limited treatment options. 
 
 
 
2. The experts are asked if the additional efficacy to the overall treatment effect of ibalizumab as 
add-on to OBR is sufficiently demonstrated in patients with MDR HIV in whom it is otherwise not 
possible to construct an antiretroviral treatment regimen?  
Experts agreed that besides short-term antiviral effect (14 days), data on long-term efficacy are missing 
precluding the possibility of having an accurate estimation of the effect of the medicine in addition to the 
OBR in controlling viral replication. However, they were also in agreement regarding the suitability of this 
product in the case of patients with limited treatment options taking also into account that at the moment 
there are no major safety concerns and that its use would not have an impact on future regimens as 
emergence of cross resistances to other antiretrovirals is not expected. In conclusion, although the 
applicant must provide more data regarding the efficacy of the product and therefore different post 
authorization measures have to be considered to address these issues, still the use in this population is 
considered justified.  
 
3. The experts are asked to reflect upon the need for generating further long-term clinical data to 
further characterize the efficacy, safety and barrier to resistance of this drug, and if so, what kind of 
collection methods (trial, registry) are relevant and feasible to conduct? 
As it was discussed during the meeting, post authorization measures are considered absolutely needed to 
better address the efficacy of the product, the safety profile and to further explore risk factors/predictors 
of virological response and/or failure. It was agreed that despite ideally being the best option for 
gathering robust evidence, a new randomised clinical trial of Ibalizumab +OBR versus OBR+placebo 
would not be feasible also in light of the small of number of patients that could be enrolled in such a study. 
Based on this, it is considered that setting up a product registry that should include patients that receive 
the products, would be an adequate approach. It is also suggested to include also those patients who 
receive the product outside of the final accepted indication ( i.e, patients with infection due to HIV-2,

patients admitted to the intensive care who could need the medicine even temporarily (IV drug), in 
selected circumstances in which drug-drugs interactions with other agents is particularly problematic).  It 
was also proposed to liaise with the ongoing and well established HIV registries to be able to perform a 
control case study to compare patients on Ibalizumab with patients with the same characteristics but 
exposed to other drugs.  
The experts also considered that other research topics such as penetration in viral sanctuaries, e.g. CSF 
and urogenital tract, could be further explored. The role in treatment of HIV-2 would be also of great 
interest considering the current unmet medical need. 
 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Taken together, although the interpretation of ibalizumab efficacy data is hampered by the complexity of 
the patient population, the single arm design of the Phase III study, a primary objective focused on 
7-days antiviral activity of ibalizumab with the consequences of unresolved uncertainties regarding the 
impact of OBR in relation to the effect induced by ibalizumab and the small patient number included. 
Overall, it seems proven that ibalizumab has antiviral activity and can be of added value for the treatment 
of patients suffering from multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to 
construct a suppressive antiviral regimen. 
 
However, due to the limitations of current knowledge, it is considered necessary to address concerns with 
respect to the maintenance of a positive benefit-risk balance due to potential lack of efficacy in the long 
term. Therefore, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to 
efficacy:  The applicant has to set-up a prospective product registry and perform a post-authorization 
study to provide more evidence on the efficacy of ibalizumab in combination with other anti-retroviral 
medicinal products in adults infected with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not 
possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen.  
 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 323 patients with HIV infection have been exposed to ibalizumab IV infusion, with 309 patients 
participating in sponsor-initiated studies, 12 patients that were originally in study TMB-202 and then on 
investigator-sponsored INDs, 2 patients that were on investigator-sponsored INDs (compassionate use). 
Extent and duration of exposure ranged from single doses of 0.3 mg/kg to 800 mg Q2W/2000 mg Q4W for 
more than 9 years. An additional 58 patients with HIV-1 infection and subjects at risk for HIV-1 infection 
have been exposed to ibalizumab administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 
For the primary analysis of safety, the combined safety database of Study TMB-301 (N=40 patients 
treated with the proposed 2000 mg loading dose followed by 800 mg every two weeks)) and Study 
TMB-202 (N=59 in the 800 mg every two weeks arm and N= 54 in the 2000 mg every 4 weeks arm) will 
be used. 
Adverse events 
In the combined safety database of study TMB-202 and TMB-301 most patients (127 out of 153; 83.0%) 
experienced at least one TEAE. Of them 25 (16.3%) reported a severe AE. In 9 patients (5.9%) the AE led 
to study discontinuation. Six (n=6; 3.9%) patients died during treatment. 
The most frequent TEAEs (reported in ≥10.0% of patients) were diarrhoea (8; 20%), nausea, fatigue, 
pyrexia, and dizziness (5; 12.5% each), and nasopharyngitis, vomiting, and lymphadenopathy (4; 10.0%

each). Rashes in general were reported for 5 (12.5%) patients and included rash, erythematous rash, 
generalized rash, macular rash, maculo-papular rash, papular rash, and pruritic rash, each of which was 
reported in 1 patient. 
Treatment-emergent AEs considered definitely related to study drug were vomiting and immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (1; 2.5% each). Treatment-emergent AEs probably or possibly 
related to study drug were diarrhoea, all rashes (2; 5.0% each) (which included erythematous rash and 
generalized rash in 1 patient each), nausea and pruritus (1; 2.5%) and dizziness (3; 7.5%). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
For Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202, SAEs were reported for 16 (16.2%) patients in the combined 800 mg 
Q2W group and 19 (12.4%) patients in the all patients combined group. The only SAEs reported for more 
than 1 patient included pyrexia in 2 patients in the combined 800 mg Q2W group (2.0%) and the all 
patients combined group (1.3%) and cytomegalovirus viremia (n=1; 1.0% in the 800 mg Q2W group and 
n=3 (2.0%) in the all patients combined group).  
One SAE (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) was considered treatment-related. 
In the other studies renal failure, depression, grand mal convulsion, bradycardia, hepatic failure, 
staphylococcal cellulitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension, coronary artery disease, vertigo, lower 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, intentional overdose, presyncope, generalized rash, and 
maculo-papular rash were reported as SAEs. 
Death 
A total of 9 deaths were reported. Six (6) for Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 and 3 for study TNX-355.03 
(Phase 2). None was considered treatment-related. An additional 6 deaths were reported in the 
Ibalizumab Safety Summary of Investigator-Sponsored IND Patients (expanded-access study). 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline to end of treatment in haematology parameters were 
observed. ≥Grade 3 haematology abnormalities were reported for 11 (8.2%) patients. ≥Grade 3 
abnormalities were reported for decreased haemoglobin (n=7; 5.2%), decreased neutrophils (n=3; 
2.2%), decreased leukocytes (n=2; 1.5%) and decreased platelets (n=1; 2.5%). 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline to end of treatment in chemistry parameters were 
observed during Study TMB-301 and TMB-202. Grade 3 or 4 chemistry abnormalities were reported for 49 
(36.6%) patients. These abnormalities were reported for decreased phosphate (n=28; 20.9%), increased 
bilirubin (n=5; 3.7%), increased lipase (n=5; 3.7%), and increased urate (n=5; 3.7%).  
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline to end of treatment in vital signs were observed during 
Study TMB-301 and TMB-202. 
None of the ECG changes observed during Study TMB-301 and TMB-202 were considered clinically 
relevant. 
Skin rashes were the only clinical relevant shift from normal. These are reported as AE (see discussion 
under adverse events of special interest). No other clinically meaningful changes from baseline to end of 
treatment in physical examination were observed during Study TMB-301 and TMB-202.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
For the combined 800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 46 patients below the age of 50 
years and 53 patients ≥ 50 years were included. For the all patients combined group 84 patients below the 
age of 50 years and 69 patients ≥ 50 years were included. The youngest patient was 23 years old, the 
oldest patient was 75 years old. No children were included in the clinical program.  
In the combined 800 mg Q2W group from Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202, the overall incidence of TEAEs 
was higher for the <50 years subgroup compared with the ≥50 years subgroup (91.3% vs 77.4%). SAEs 
were reported for 6 (13.0%) patients in the <50 years subgroup and 10 (18.9%) patients in the ≥50 years 
subgroup. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported for 2 (4.3%) patients in the <50 
years subgroup and 6 (11.3%) patients in the ≥50 years subgroup. 
The subgroup analysis of haematology and chemistry did not reveal any trend in age related adverse 
events. 
The SAE and adverse events leading to discontinuation appeared higher in the ≥50 group. 
The PDCO has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with ibalizumab in pre-term and/or 
term neonates (0-27 days), infants and toddlers (1 month to 23 months), and children (2 to 5 years) for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit 
the results of studies with ibalizumab in children and adolescents (aged 6 to less than 18 years) for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Gender 
For the combined 800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 85 male and 14 female patients 
were included. For the all patients combined group 135 male patients and 18 female patients were 
included. 
The subgroup analysis did not show striking differences between male and female patients for TEAEs, 
SAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, haematology and chemistry.  
Race 
For the combined 800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 64 Caucasian patients, 5 Asian 
patients and 30 patients of other races were included. For the all patients combined group 91 Caucasian 
patients, 8 Asian patients and 54 patients of other races were included. 
In the combined 800 mg Q2W group from Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202, the overall incidence of TEAEs, 
SAE and changes in haematology and chemistry was similar for white patients compared with patients of 
other races (82.8% vs 83.3%). For the combined 800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202, 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported for 4 (6.3%) white patients and 4 (13.3%) 
patients of other races. 
Geographic Region 
For the combined 800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 94 US patients and 5 patients 
from Taiwan were included. For the all patients combined group 145 US patients and 8 patients from 
Taiwan were included. 
No firm conclusions about the influence of geographic region on the safety profile can be drawn due to the 
skewness of the patient distribution (145 from US and 8 from Taiwan). The subgroup analysis, however, 
did not show striking differences between patients from US vs Taiwan for TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation, haematology and chemistry.

Immunological events 
At baseline none of the patients evaluated showed a positive antibody response.  
Only incidental patients with an antibody response were reported (2 patients in study TNX-355.03 and 
one patient in TMB-202). Contrary to the other studies, in phase 1b study TNX-355.02 7 out of 22 patients 
(31.8%) had a positive antibody response at some time during the study. In some patients the presence 
of antibodies was demonstrable until the end of the study.  
The only patient with antibody repeated activity in study TMB-202 did not show any negative effect on 
efficacy or safety of ibalizumab.  
The applicant did not discuss nor reported the development of neutralising antibodies.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-interaction studies have been conducted with ibalizumab.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Twenty-four (24.2%) patients in the 800 mg Q2W group and 40 (26.1%) patients in the all patients 
combined group did not complete study treatment. The most frequently reported reasons for 
discontinuation for the combined 800 mg Q2W group were virologic failure (7 patients) and AE (6 
patients; 5 of whom died due to AE). The most frequently reported reasons for discontinuation for the all 
patients combined group was virologic failure (13 patients). 
The overall incidence of discontinuations due to TEAE is 9 out of 134 patients (6.7%; Study TMB-301 n=5, 
12.5%; Study TMB-202 800 mg Q2W n=3, 5.1%; 2000 mg Q4W n=1, 1.9%)  
Post marketing experience 
Post marketing experience with ibalizumab is very limited, as expected. According to the applicant, a 
review of the available safety data from the Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports submitted to the 
EMA, did not identify new safety signals that change the safety profile of ibalizumab.    
 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The number of patients included in the safety database is limited. A total of 323 patients with HIV 
infection have been exposed to ibalizumab IV infusion. Extent and duration of exposure ranged from 
single doses of 0.3 mg/kg to 800 mg Q2W/2000 mg Q4W for more than 9 years.  
 
For the to be marketed treatment regimen, 2000 mg loading dose followed by 800 mg Q2W, safety data 
from only 40 patients from a single-arm study and 38 patients from the expanded access study is 
available. 
 
For the primary analysis of safety, the combined safety database of Study TMB-301 (N=40 treated with 
the proposed 2000 mg loading dose followed by 800 mg every two weeks) and Study TMB-202 (N=59 in 
the 800 mg every two weeks arm and N=54 in the 2000 mg every 4 weeks arm) is used. 
 
In Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202, the most frequently reported TEAEs (in >10% of patients in either 
combined group) were all rashes and diarrhoea (14.1% each), nasopharyngitis (11.1%), and cough 
(10.1%) for the combined 800 mg Q2W group and all rashes (17.6%), diarrhoea (15.0%), and rash 
(11.8%) for the all patients combined group.

The incidence of TEAEs was generally similar between the 800 mg Q2W group in Study TMB-202 and 
Study TMB-301.  
 
The majority of TEAEs were considered unrelated to treatment with ibalizumab. Treatment-emergent AEs 
considered definitely related to study drug were vomiting and immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome (n=1; 2.5% and n=2; 5%, respectively). Treatment-emergent AEs probably related to study 
drug were diarrhoea, all rashes (n=2; 5.0% each). The only TEAE considered possibly related to study 
drug and reported in more than 1 patient was dizziness (n=3; 7.5%) A tabulated presentation of all 
treatment related TEAEs with corresponding frequencies (without splitting in definitely, probably, or 
possibly related TEAEs) by SOC and by PT has been presented.  
 
The incidence of severe TEAEs was similar between Study TMB-301 (17.5%) and the 2000 mg Q4W 
groups from Study TMB-202 (16.7%), but higher than the 800 mg Q2W group (6.8%) from Study 
TMB-202. None of the events was judged by the investigator’s to be study drug-related and in 3 cases 
SAEs were typical AIDS-associated disorders.  
 
Rash, which was a commonly observed event in both studies, is recognized as a predictable and often 
manageable side effect of treatment with monoclonal antibodies. In general, rashes have an early onset 
(i.e., within 1 to 3 weeks of the first dose of ibalizumab), are mild to moderate in intensity, and resolve 
without treatment or dose adjustment. Among TMB-202 and TMB-301 studies, 18 rashes out of 25 (72%) 
were judged by the investigator as possibly or probably related to ibalizumab. No rash-specific analyses 
were performed. Hematology results obtained from overall patients participating in the two studies do not 
add significant information regarding rash etiology and confounding factors do not allow to identify risk 
factors for rash.  
 
Other TEAEs of interest that were examined for a potential association with ibalizumab treatment included 
malignancy and events relating to hepatotoxicity. Seven (7) malignancy events were reported (4 patients 
in Study TMB-301, 1 patient in the 800 mg Q2W group of Study TMB-202, and 2 patients in the 2000 mg 
Q4W group of Study TMB-202), 6 events were considered unrelated by the investigator. One (monoclonal 
gammopathy of uncertain significance, 2000 mg Q4W group of Study TMB-202) of these events was 
considered treatment-related. Two (2) events relating to hepatotoxicity were reported (1 patient in Study 
TMB-301 and 1 patient in the 800 mg Q2W group of Study TMB-202) and none was considered 
treatment-related. 
 
In all studies combined the following SAEs were reported; pyrexia, cytomegalovirus viremia, renal failure, 
depression, grand mal convulsion, bradycardia, hepatic failure, staphylococcal cellulitis, hepatic 
encephalopathy, hypotension, coronary artery disease, vertigo, lower abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
hypersensitivity, intentional overdose, pre-syncope, generalized rash, and maculo-papular rash. 
Depression, pyrexia and cytomegalovirus viremia were reported more than once. One SAE (immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) was considered treatment-related. The applicant provided a 
re-evaluation of the relationship of ibalizumab and TEAEs reported, and concluded that some of the AEs 
were related to advanced AIDS related diseases and not to ibalizumab. 
 
 
A total of 9 deaths were reported. Six (6) for Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 and 3 for study TNX-355.03 
(Phase 2). None was considered treatment-related by the investigator. An additional 6 deaths were 
reported in the Ibalizumab Safety Summary of Investigator-Sponsored IND patients (expanded-access 
study). The 10% rate of death is in line with what was observed in other studies.  
 
The most common abnormality across all groups was decreased phosphate. The Applicant specified that

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
the approx. 20% hypophosphatemia noted in TMB-202 was an artefact and that in the Study TMB-202 the 
real reported cases with grade 3 or grade 4 abnormality in phosphate were 2. Moreover, the lack of data 
on renal functionality, such as creatinine elevations and/or urine protein, was noted. Firm conclusions on 
a causal relationship between ibalizumab administration and renal abnormalities cannot be drawn. 
Nevertheless, the SmPC includes a statement to alert physicians that Grade 3 creatinine elevations 
occurred frequently in subjects with underlying renal disease, risk factors for renal disease, and/or in 
subjects taking concomitant medications known to be nephrotoxic. 
 
No drug-drug-interaction studies have been conducted with ibalizumab. As no interactions are expected, 
this is considered acceptable. 
 
Antibodies against ibalizumab were measured in all patients. At some time during treatment antibodies 
against ibalizumab could be demonstrated in 10 patients. In the pivotal studies only one patient reported 
a continuing antibody titer. The low antibody titer (Ab titer was 16) did not interfere with efficacy (HIV-1 
RNA remained undetectable while CD4+ cells increased) nor safety (no AEs were reported by the patient). 
Therefore, it might be concluded that there is a low risk of immunogenicity for ibalizumab. This is in line 
with the findings reported in literature where IgG4 antibodies are considered to be less immunogenic 
compared to other therapeutic antibodies.  
 
Surprisingly, in phase 1b study TNX-355.02 7 out of 22 patients (31.8%) had a positive antibody 
response at some time during the study. The applicant provided more information on the observed 
antibodies in Study TNX-355.02. It remains however unknown why there were relatively many patients in 
this study in whom antibodies were observed.  Neutralizing antibodies were not measured, but given the 
low incidence of ADA development with ibalizumab, the risk of developing neutralizing antibodies is also 
low. 
 
Overall, the safety profile of ibalizumab from the extension Study TMB-311 does not seem to show new 
or unexpected adverse events. 68 of 75 patients (90.7%) have reported treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs). However, it was noted that vascular disorders occurred in 12 (16%) patients of whom 5 
(6.7%) were deep vein thrombosis (DVT). All 5 observed Deep vein thrombosis events were considered 
by investigators to be unrelated to ibalizumab treatment. Furthermore, occurrence with regards to start 
of ibalizumab was temporally heterogeneous, making causal relationship between these SAEs and the 
study drug unlikely.  
 
The subgroup analyses for age, gender, race, and geographic region were performed using the combined 
800 mg Q2W group in Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202. A total of 99 patients were included. Based on 
these limited data it can be concluded that no striking difference for any safety issue related to the 
subgroups studied was observed.  
 
No pregnancies occurred and no women were breast-feeding in the clinical development program. 
 
No children were included in the clinical program. The PDCO has waived the obligation to submit the 
results of studies with ibalizumab in pre-term and/or term neonates (0-27 days), infants and toddlers (1 
month to 23 months), and children (2 to 5 years) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The PDCO has 
deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with ibalizumab in children and adolescents (aged 
6 to less than 18 years) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
 
The number of patients discontinuing due to AE appears high (40 (26.1%) in the pivotal studies). 
However, the relation between treatment and the observed AEs remains to be established. Therefore, no 
conclusions can be drawn from this high number of patients discontinuing due to AE. Post marketing

experience with ibalizumab is very limited. As the safety database of the product is limited, the Applicant 
has discussed whether additional pharmacovigilance activities could be introduced to enhance 
characterizing the safety profile of the product; the applicant has contacted the organisers of registries 
and is currently investigating whether data from these registries can be used.  
 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Given the limited number of patients included in the database, the open label design and lack of a control 
arm in the main studies, the individualised optimized background regimen (OBR), the progression of the 
disease (most patients had CD4+ cell count <50 cells/μl), interpretation of the safety data of ibalizumab 
is hampered. 
Despite the limitations and uncertainties of the safety profile, no serious safety risks emerged. Routine 
pharmacovigilance will be utilized to further characterize the safety profile of ibalizumab 
post-authorisation.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 06 March 2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that ibalizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
Medicinal Product no longer authorised

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers ibalizumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Trogarzo (Ibalizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The following indication is claimed for ibalizumab: 
Ibalizumab is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of 
adults infected with HIV-1 resistant to at least 1 agent in 3 different classes. 
During the procedure this indication was updated as follows: 
Trogarzo, in combination with other antiretroviral(s), is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with 
multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive 
antiviral regimen (see section 5.1). 
The eventually proposed posology is: 
The recommended dose of ibalizumab is a single loading dose of 2,000 mg followed by a maintenance 
dose of 800 mg every 2 weeks.  
 
If the treating physician determines there is no additional clinical benefit for the patient in terms of viral 
load reduction, discontinuation of ibalizumab treatment should be considered. 
 
The sought indication is in patients infected with multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1. MDR HIV-1 is defined 
as those patients with HIV-1 who have phenotypic or genotypic resistance to at least three of the standard 
antiretroviral therapy drug classes. MDR HIV-1 is usually established by at least one major resistance 
mutation within each drug class present in genotypic resistance testing, but in these patients often many 
resistance mutations are seen simultaneously. Upon virologic failure to their current antiretroviral 
regimen, these patients often have limited (or no) treatment options remaining. 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for HIV-1 infection consists of a combination of 3 antiretroviral agents (ARV), from at 
least 2 different classes, and typically includes 2 NRTIs plus a third agent from the PI, NNRTI, or INSTI 
class. This treatment works well to suppress HIV-1 viral load to undetectable levels in the far majority of 
patients. However, viral resistance to any regimen can develop, due to e.g. poor adherence, too low 
exposure due to drug interactions, or low potency of the drug.  
Patients with multidrug resistant (MDR) HIV-1 have very few treatment options left due to high viral 
resistance. When viral replication is not suppressed to an undetectable level, patients are at increased risk 
for disease progression, AIDS, and ultimately death. Also, there is a risk of transmission of HIV-1 to 
uninfected partners when the infected partner is not virologically suppressed. Treatment regimens in MDR 
HIV-1 patients typically include drugs at higher than standard dosages and drugs from less frequently 
used classes such as Fusion inhibitors and CCR5 antagonists. It is recommended in HIV-1 treatment 
guidelines that, in case of MDR HIV-1, to use at least 2 and preferably 3 active drugs in the new regimen 
and to also consider investigational agents for patients for whom it is not possible to construct a 
sustainable suppressive regimen using approved treatment options.

EMA/469134/2019  
Page 93/94
 
classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
 
The main goal in any HIV-1 infected patient is full virologic suppression, i.e. having HIV-1 RNA load below 
the limit of detection of most commonly used assays (often <50 copies/mL blood). If virologic 
suppression cannot be achieved, the next best becomes preserving immunologic function, preventing 
clinical progression, and minimizing the increasing resistance to drug classes that could potentially 
include newly developed drugs. 
The applicant determined the prevalence of MDR-HIV-1 infection in the EU as of 6 October 2017 to be 
about 52,000 people out of 840,000 people living with HIV in the EU (6.2%).  Out of the 52,000 people 
living with MDR HIV-1, the applicant estimates that approximatively 5 to 10% of these patients have 
limited treatment options and have immediate need for a new treatment. The target population for this 
product would be mainly the MDR HIV patients who experience virological failure. While the estimated 
prevalence at the moment is definitely below 1%, it is considered an unmet need as these patients have 
limited therapeutic options with higher risk of disease progression, and are in need of new therapies such 
as ibalizumab.   
 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three studies are considered most important for this application, Phase III study TMB-301 and Phase II 
studies TMB-202 and TNX-355.03. 
Study TMB-301 was a single-arm, multicentre, open-label study in treatment-experienced patients 
infected with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 (n=40). The study consisted of a control period during which 
patients remained on their failing regimen, or received no treatment (days 0-6), a functional ibalizumab 
monotherapy period (days 7-13, 2000 mg ibalizumab) and a maintenance period during which patients 
received an OBR (day 14-week 25) with ibalizumab infusions (800 mg ibalizumab every other week 
starting at day 21). 
Study TMB-202 was a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, 24-week, dose-response study in 
treatment-experienced patients infected with HIV-1 (n=113). Patients received one of the following two 
dose regimens: 800 mg of ibalizumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus OBR, or 2000 mg of ibalizumab every 4 
weeks (Q4W) and placebo on the intervening 2-week period visit, plus OBR. 
Study TNX-355.03 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, 
3-arm safety and efficacy study in subjects with HIV-1 and who were failing or had failed highly active 
antiretroviral therapy (n=82). Subjects all received OBT plus 1 of the following regimens: alternating 
intravenous (IV) infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab and placebo, weekly for the first 9 doses (through the 
Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of 15 mg/kg ibalizumab every 2 weeks (Arm A); 10 mg/kg ibalizumab IV 
infusions weekly for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), then IV infusions of 10 mg/kg ibalizumab 
every 2 weeks (Arm B); or weekly placebo IV infusions for the first 9 doses (through the Week 8 visit), 
then IV infusions of placebo every 2 weeks (Placebo arm). 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study TMB-301, the estimated proportion of patients in the ITT population achieving a ≥0.5 log10 
decrease from day 0 at day 7/baseline (control period) was 1/40 (2.5% [95% CI (0.6%, 13.2%)]). The 
estimated proportion of patients in the ITT population achieving a ≥0.5 log10 decrease from day 
7/baseline at day 14 (monotherapy period) was 33/40 (82.5% [95% CI (67.2%, 92.7%)]). At week 
25/EOS, the estimated proportion of patients in the ITT population achieving a ≥0.5 log10 decrease from

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
baseline was 25/40 (62.5% [95% CI (45.8%, 77.3%)]). In the ITT-MEF (missing evaluated as failure) 
analysis, 17 of 40 patients (42.5%) achieved HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL at week 25/EOS with a 
95% CI of (27.0%, 59.1%) and 21 of 40 patients (52.5%) achieved HIV-1 RNA levels <400 copies/ml at 
week 25/EOS with a 95% CI of (36.1%, 68.4%).  
In study TMB-202, the ITT-MEF analysis resulted in an estimated proportion of patients having a viral load 
of <50 copies/ml at Week 24 of 44.1% (95% CI (31.2%, 57.6%)) in the 800 mg Q2W treatment group, 
and 27.8% (95% CI (16.5%, 41.6%)) in the 2000 mg Q4W treatment group.  
In study TNX-355.03, by Week 16, i.e. prior to the possible switching of patients in the Placebo arm to the 
15 mg/kg dose of ibalizumab every 2 weeks and/or to change in OBR for all patients, mean viral load 
decrease was 1.07 log10 copies/ml in Arm A, 1.33 log10 copies/mL in Arm B and 0.26 log10 copies/ml in 
the Placebo arm (p=0.002 vs Arm A, p <0.001 vs Arm B). 
In Study TMB-301 the estimated increase in mean values for CD4+ T-cell counts from baseline to Week 
25 was 62.4 cells/ul (SD=105.8 cells/ul). In Study TMB-202, the estimated increase in mean CD4+ T cell 
counts from baseline to Week 24 was 36.5 cells/ul (SD=63.0 cells/ul) in the 800 mg Q2W treatment 
group, and was 39.8 cells/ul (SD=80.1 cells/ul) in the 2000 mg Q4W treatment group. 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are several uncertainties in the submitted material, due to the chosen single arm design of the 
Phase III study with a primary objective focusing on 14-days antiviral activity of ibalizumab, that do have 
an impact on the level of benefit and uncertainty that has been shown. Most importantly: the lack of a 
control arm, the very different OBRs that have been given concomitantly, the small number of patients 
treated,  the rather short follow-up period, and the external validity of the study results. 
Patient population. The comparability of the trial populations in Study TMB-301 and TMB-202, as well 
as their comparability to the envisioned target population, is suboptimal (especially for study TMB-202), 
although relevant information can still be obtained.  Efficacy results stratified by CD4 cells shows a low 
response rate in patients with a CD4 count below 50/mmc. 
Lack of a control arm. Both Study TMB-301 and TMB-202 lack a control arm. This hampers the 
interpretation of the study outcome.  
OBR. While the effect of ibalizumab in reducing viral load during the 7 day monotherapy period is clear 
and appreciated, it is unknown what part of the antiviral effect between day 14 and end of study can be 
attributed to ibalizumab and what part to the OBR. There was a clear trend toward increasing virologic 
responses with increasing OSS values (Overall sensitivity score; sum of active drugs in OBR based on a 
net assessment of information from genotypic and phenotypic testing results). A thorough investigation 
around the number and type of active ARVs in the OBR for each individual patient in relation to virologic 
outcome revealed that there were some patients for whom it was very unlikely that the outcome would 
have been reached solely based on the predicted activity of the OBR.  
Dose selection. The choice of dose has been made on the basis of PK/PD assumptions. It is unknown 
whether the chosen dose is optimal for durable efficacy.   
Sample size. The total number of patients treated (n=326 overall, n=40 with the recommended 
posology) leaves uncertainties on the clinical benefits (and risks) of ibalizumab, especially for subgroups. 
No data is available in special populations. The applicant has committed to set-up a prospective product 
registry and perform a post-authorization study to gain more data.

classified as internal/staff & contractors by the European Medicines Agency.  
Long-term benefit. The added value of ibalizumab on long-term health, including life-expectancy, is 
unknown. The planned product registry and post-authorization study may provide further information. 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In Studies TMB-301, TMB-202 and TMB-311, the most frequently reported AEs were all rashes (9.2%) 
diarrhoea (3.9%), dizziness (3.9%), headache (3.9%), nausea (3.9%), fatigue (2.0%) and vomiting 
(2.0%). 
AEs considered definitely-related to study drug were vomiting, immune reconstitution inflammatory 
syndrome and hypersensitivity (n=1; 0.7% each). AEs probably-related to study drug according to the 
physician were diarrhoea (n=3; 2%), all rashes and vomiting (n=2; 1.3% each), dermatitis, fatigue, 
headache, nausea and pruritus (n=1, 0.7% each). Dizziness and dry skin were considered 
possibly-related to study drug and reported in more than 1 patient (n=6; 3.9%; n=2 1.3%, respectively). 
A total of 9 deaths were reported. Six for Studies TMB-301 and TMB-202 (n=4 and n=2, respectively), 
and 3 earlier during clinical development (in Phase II study TNX-355.03). None was considered 
treatment-related by the physician. An additional 6 deaths were reported in the Ibalizumab Safety 
Summary of Investigator-Sponsored IND patients. 
Virologic failure or rebound occurred in 10/40 (25%) patients in TMB-301 and 30/113 (26.5%) patients in 
TMB-202. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses showed a reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab in the 
virologic failure vs. baseline samples. 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main uncertainties and limitations about the unfavourable effects are related to the small sample size 
of the treated population, the advanced disease of many patients enrolled in the studies, the single-arm 
design of the main study TMB-301, and the lack of a comparator arm in both main studies.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For patients with multidrug resistant HIV-1, it is not always possible to construct an antiretroviral regimen 
that will be fully suppressive. Hence, in these patients, treatment is often aimed to at least preserve CD4 
cell counts, and delay clinical progression. Additionally, an aim of treatment may be to lower viral load to 
such a level that the risk of further spread of the infection to the patient’s partner(s) is reduced. There is 
an unmet medical need for novel treatment options for these patients who cannot be adequately treated 
with the existing therapeutic arsenal due to extensive viral resistance.  
Ibalizumab may be able to address some of this unmet medical need. It has a novel mechanism of action 
compared to currently available ARVs and has activity against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic viruses. 
Existing resistance towards other ARVs does not hamper the activity of ibalizumab. 
Antiviral activity of ibalizumab has most convincingly been shown in the short monotherapy period in 
Phase III study TMB-301. The estimated proportion of patients who achieved a ≥0.5 log10 decrease with 
7 days functional monotherapy was 82.5% (95% CI [67.2%, 92.8%]), which is considered to be of clinical 
relevance. After this period, each patient received an OBR, with a variable number of active ARVs, next to 
the ibalizumab infusions every two weeks. Due to this setup, and the lack of a control arm without 
ibalizumab, the contribution of OBR to the overall treatment effect cannot be determined. Evidence that

ibalizumab as add-on to OBR contributes to durability of virologic response can  be inferred from 
estimating the likely activity of each patient’s individual OBR based on the mutations in the patient’s viral 
sequences and the Stanford HIV drug resistance database 
(https://hivdb.stanford.edu/hivdb/by-mutations/), and comparing this to the observed virologic 
response during treatment with OBR + ibalizumab. Given that there were some patients for whom it was 
very unlikely that the outcome would have been reached solely based on the predicted activity of the 
OBR, and given the significant viral load decrease observed upon ibalizumab monotherapy between days 
7 to 14 in the far majority of patients, it was considered that there is a clear suggestion of an added effect 
of ibalizumab on top of the OBR. All patients for whom this was applicable, had an OSS score of 0 or 1 and 
hence a restricted indication in adults infected with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is 
otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen, is justified.     
 
The safety data is difficult to interpret, due to the limited number of patients included in the database, the 
open label design of the Phase III study, the lack of a control arm in the two main studies, the individually 
optimized background regimen (OBR), and the advanced disease status of most patients (many had 
CD4+ cell count <50 cells/μl). However, no major safety concerns have emerged.  
 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Although the interpretation of ibalizumab efficacy data is hampered by the small patient numbers, the 
complexity of the patient population, the single-arm design of the pivotal study, short follow-up time, and 
uncertainties regarding the impact of OBR in relation to the effect induced by ibalizumab, overall it seems 
proven that ibalizumab has antiviral activity and can be of added value for the treatment of a restricted 
population of patients suffering from multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not 
possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen. The applicant committed to set-up a product 
registry, in which patients treated with ibalizumab will be actively followed for efficacy, and to perform a 
post-authorisation efficacy study, in which clinical progression of participants enrolled in the registry will 
be compared with patients who did not receive ibalizumab, by matching on at least OBR and main 
baseline patient and disease characteristics. 
Overall, the safety profile seems to be acceptable, taking the patient population and their need for novel 
treatment options into account. However, no major safety concerns have emerged. Routine 
pharmacovigilance will be utilized to further characterize the safety profile of ibalizumab 
post-authorisation.  
 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Due to the limitations of current knowledge, it is considered necessary to address concerns with respect 
to the maintenance of a positive benefit-risk balance due to potential lack of efficacy in the long term. 
Therefore, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:  In 
order to further characterise the efficacy of ibalizumab in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal 
products, for the treatment of adults infected with multidrug resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is 
otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen, the MAH should conduct and submit 
the results of a study based on data from a product registry. This study should be conducted according to 
an agreed protocol.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trogarzo is positive for the indication for the treatment of adults infected with multidrug 
resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral 
regimen.   
 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Trogarzo in the treatment of adults infected with multidrug 
resistant HIV-1 infection for whom it is otherwise not possible to construct a suppressive antiviral regimen 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:
