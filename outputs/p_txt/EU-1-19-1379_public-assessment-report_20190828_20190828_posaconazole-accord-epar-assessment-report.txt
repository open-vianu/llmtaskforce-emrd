10(2)(b) referring to a so-called reference medicinal product with a marketing authorisation granted in a 
Member State or in the Community. The active substance posaconazole has been in medicinal use for 
more than 10 years in the Community. The reference medicinal product is Noxafil 100 mg gastro-resistant 
tablets.  
The product Posaconazole Accord is of the same indication, strength and route of administration as that 
of the reference medicinal product, having the same qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of 
active substance and is of the same pharmaceutical form as the comparator product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/354142/2019  
Page 7/26
 
The proposed indications for Posaconazole Accord are for refractory invasive fungal infections 
(IFI)/patients with IFI intolerant to 1st line therapy and prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections. The 
recommended loading dose of 300 mg (three 100 mg tablets) twice a day on the first day, then 300 mg 
(three 100 mg tablets) once a day thereafter. Each dose may be taken without regard to food intake. 
Duration of therapy should be based on the severity of the underlying disease, recovery from 
immunosuppression, and clinical response.  
The active substance posaconazole is a member of the antimycotics for systemic use, triazole derivatives 
therapeutic class. The mode of action of posaconazole is by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 
14α-demethylase (CYP51), which catalyses an essential step in ergosterol biosynthesis.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of posaconazole is 4-[4-[4-[4-[[(3R,5R)-5-(2,4-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-5-(1H- 
1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)-3-furanyl]methoxy]phenyl]-1-piperazinyl]phenyl]-2-[(1S,2S)-1-ethyl-2-hydro
xypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one corresponding to the molecular formula C37H42F2N8O4. It 
has a relative molecular mass of 700.8 g/mol and the following structure: 
 
Figure 1: active substance structure. 
The chemical structure of posaconazole was elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic techniques such 
as elemental analysis, ultraviolet, FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectrometry, specific optical rotation

EMA/354142/2019  
Page 8/26
 
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD).  
Posaconazole is a white to off-white colour non-hygroscopic powder, soluble in dichloromethane and 
insoluble in water and aqueous media ranging from pH 1.2-8.0. It is a chiral compound and possesses 
four asymmetric carbons. The active form is the (3R, 5R) (1S, 2S) isomer. The stereogenic centers 
originate from the starting materials (2S from VPOS3, 3R,5R from PSZ5). Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC/specific optical rotation. 
Posaconazole exhibits polymorphism. As described in literature, it exists in different crystalline forms. The 
active substance manufacturing process established by the proposed active substance 
manufacturer,which consistently produces the same form . This has been confirmed by XRD 
analysis.  The polymorphic form has been shown to remain stable during storage of the active substance.  
Posaconazole is an established drug substance; however, it is not subject of a monograph in the Ph.Eur.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of posaconazole (form I) utilizes a convergent strategy and comprises of two 
branches (Stage 1 and Stages 2/3) with two chemical steps, respectively, before the point of conversion 
(stage 4).  
Two further chemical steps are performed after the point of conversion: Stage-5  followed by Stage-6.  
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance was provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The information provided on the manufacturing process in both parts of the ASMF was deemed 
acceptable. The proposed starting materials are acceptable. A sufficient number of true chemical 
transformation steps (as per ICH Q11 glossary) separate the proposed starting materials from the final 
active substance. This is considered adequate to ensure that the generation, fate and control of impurities 
can be understood and that active substance of appropriate quality is consistently obtained.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The ASMF holder provided a discussion and risk assessment on mutagenic impurities, and batch data for 
potential genotoxic impurities as per the ICH M7 guideline. Absence of carry-over for these impurities has 
been reported. 
A risk assessment for the Class 1 elements , Class 2A elements , Class 3 elementsand Other elements 
used in the manufacturing process of Posaconazolewas also presented. The absences of carryover these 
elements was demonstrated in three commercial scale batches of active substance with suitable ICP-MS 
method. 
The active substance is packaged in a clear low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bag tied with a strip and 
placed inside a black colour LDPE bag and also tied with a stripThe PE coming in direct contact with the 
active substance meets the requirements of the EMEA Note for guidance on plastic materials. A 
declaration together with vendor certificate of analysis regarding the suitability of the polyethylene bags 
for use with food and pharmaceuticals has been provided in line with Ph.Eur. monograph 3.1.3 for 
Polyolefins and the packaging components in line with Commission regulation (EU) No 10/2011.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (IR, HPLC), specific 
optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), 
chiral purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and polymorphic identification (PXRD). 
The respective limits have been defined in accordance with the requirements described in the Ph. Eur.  
general chapters and the manufacturer’s in-house specifications follow EU and ICH Guidelines. All 
specified impurities are limited tighter than generally acceptable by ICH Q3A. 
Since posaconazole is not a sterile active substance and it is being used to manufacture a solid oral 
dosage form, microbial quality is not included in the active substance. Microbial quality is addressed in the 
finished product specification (see relevant section). 
A justification for the omission of a particle size specification has been provided and deemed acceptable 
as not impacting the quality of the finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 5 commercial scale of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from four commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the marketfor up to 48 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC 
/ 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, specific optical rotation, water content, 
related substances, chiral purity, assay and polymorphic identification. The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release.  
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No trends were observed at long term or accelerated 
conditions. 
A forced degradation study was conducted to confirm the stability indicating nature of the assay method. 
Posaconazole was exposed to elevated temperature, high humidity, sunlight, photodegradation, 
oxidation, and water, acid  and base  hydrolysis. The study indicated that posaconazole is slightly 
sensitive to sunlight exposure and LUX direct, sensitive to thermal and acid exposure, and very sensitive 
to hydrolysis and peroxide degradation. It is relatively stable to high humidity, UV direct, UV indirect, LUX 
indirect and water hydrolysis. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The product is presented as gastro-resistant tablets containing 100 mg of posaconazole. 
Assessment report  
EMA/354142/2019  
Page 10/26
 
The tablets are 17.5 x 6.7 mm yellow coated, capsule shaped, debossed with “100P” on one side and plain 
on the other side. 
The pharmaceutical development was focused on developing a product to be identical to Noxafil 100 mg 
gastro-resistant tablets (EMEA/H/C/000610) manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. from the 
European market. Emphasis was given to the preparation of amorphous molecular dispersion by HME 
which is necessary to produce similar dissolution profiles and to stabilise the composition with regard to 
impurities. 
Due to patent constraints, a qualitatively different composition has been selected for the test formulation 
when compared to the reference product.  
As indicated in the active substance section, a specific posaconazole form is used for the manufacture of 
the finished product. Posaconazole is a crystalline, white to off-white coloured powder, insoluble in water 
and aqueous media and practically insoluble at physiological pH (BCS Class 4), and non-hygroscopic. No 
significant difference in the solubility of diverse posaconazole formsin acidic or in near neutral 
environment  was observed. Thus, it is required to convert the active substance into an amorphous solid 
dispersion (molecular solution) using similar technology to that of innovator in order to increase active 
substance solubility at physiological pH and obtain similar dissolution profiles to the reference medicinal 
product. The properties of the active substance consideredas having a potential effect on the finished 
product were studied and discussed  
The excipients used in Posaconazole Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets were selected based on the 
excipients used in the reference medicinal product, excipient compatibility studies, prior knowledge on 
the formulation and experience gained through the preliminary development. A summary of the 
excipient-drug substance compatibility studies and the selection of each excipient grade has been 
provided. 
Excipient-active substance compatibility was assessed by analysing mixtures of excipient and 
posaconazole in the solid state. Common excipients functioning as polymer, filler, plasticizer, 
disintegrant, binder, glidant, lubricant and the film forming material were evaluated. The physical 
mixtures were stored at 40°C/75 % RH in both open and closed containers. No change in the impurities 
trend was observed. Subsequent assurance of compatibility of selected excipients was provided by 
accelerated stability data of development batches and ongoing stability studies using the formulation 
proposed for commercialization. From the results of ICH stability testing, it is concluded that the active 
substance is compatible with the excipients of the present formulations and that the formulation is stable. 
The excipients in posaconazole Accord gastro-resistant tablets 100 mg are methacrylic acid-ethyl Acrylate 
Copolymer (1:1) (Type-B) as enteric polymer, xylitol (E967)as processing aid, triethyl citrate (E1505) as 
plasticiser, hydroxypropylcellulose (E463) as binder, propyl gallate (E310)as antioxidant, microcrystalline 
cellulose (E460) as diluent, colloidal anhydrous silica as glidant, sodium stearyl fumarate as lubricant and 
the coating agent (polyvinyl alcohol-part hydrolysed, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, talc (E553b), 
iron oxide yellow (E172)) . All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, except for the film coating agent which is not listed in the Ph. Eur, but 
its single ingredients either comply with it, or were mentioned in the list of approved drug colours to those 
listed in Commission directive 2008/128/EC and Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 which 
regulates food and colours. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list 
of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The level of excipients used in the formulation was studied conducting an initial risk assessment to 
investigate the effect of formulation variables that may affect product critical quality attributes (CQAs), 
followed by subsequent formulation development studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/354142/2019  
Page 11/26
 
Initial development trials were executed based on available literature, patent review, earlier experience 
on similar molecules and preliminary experimentation to evaluate process feasibility, dissolution and the 
stability.  
The reference manufacturer uses a HME process to convert the active substance to an amorphous 
molecular dispersion to improve the dissolution and the bio-availability of posaconazole. Hence, as 
indicated above. emphasis was given to the preparation of an amorphous molecular dispersion for this 
product using HME, to produce similar dissolution profiles. The polymorphic conversion was confirmed by 
PXRD analysis. In parallel, work was done to stabilise the composition with respect to impurities. 
In this regard, an initial prototype formulation was prepared and subjected to stability studies at 
accelerated condition to check the suitability of the formulation with respect to the related substances. An 
unspecified impurity was found at relatively high level in the initial sample and outside the specification 
limits at 6 months. The forced degradation studies indicated that the impurity is formed under peroxide 
and thermal degradation, and the addition of an anti-oxidant will reduce the formation of this impurity.  
Given the need of a high processing temperaturefor the HME process, and based on earlier experience, it 
was decided to use propyl gallate in the test formulation to reduce the degradation since this anti-oxidant 
is relatively stable to temperature that prevails during the manufacturing process.  The inclusion of the 
antioxidant was not sufficiently justified in the dossier, and in line with the guideline on inclusion of 
antioxidants and antimicrobial preservatives in medicinal products (CPMP/CVMP/QWP/115/95) a Major 
Objection was raised during the review. The applicant justified the choice of the manufacturing process 
and further explained that various formulations which different amounts of propyl gallate were 
manufactured to evaluate the effectiveness on control of impurity by exposing the tablets to accelerated 
conditions. These were used to perform shelf-life predictions for the product. The predictive value was 
demonstrated by comparison to real time data. The unspecified impurity was significantly reduced when 
adding propyl gallate, but lower (and always below the specific limit) when using the highest amount 
ofantioxidant. Based on these results, it was decided how much propyl gallate shall be used to ensure 
stability of the formulation throughout shelf life, and to reduce the total weight of the tablet to make the 
size of generic formulation almost equivalent to the reference product. Considering the posology of the 
product, the maximum consumption of propyl gallate from the test formulation is negligible when 
compared to the ADI recommended by either EFSA (30 mg/day) or FAO/WHO Expert committee (84 
mg/day) for an average body weight of 60 kg. Therefore, the inclusion of propyl gallate as an antioxidant 
to prevent posaconazole oxidation in the hot-melt extrusion process is considered acceptable. 
The revised test formulation and reference products showed similar dissolution profiles and after 
exposure of the test product for 6 months at accelerated condition the unspecified individual impurity was 
well within the specification limits.  The content uniformity of posaconazole and propyl gallate was also 
well within the limits. There was no reduction in the content of propyl gallate upon exposure to the 
accelerated condition. No form conversion was observed in the finished product. 
Subsequently, it was decided to evaluate the impact of specific functional excipients on the dissolution, 
polymorphism and manufacturability of the generic formulation. Composition of the formulation in the 
further studies was similar to the revised test formulation, except the amount of the excipient under 
study, namely methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer, triethyl citrate, xylitol, hydroxypropylcellulose, 
colloidal anhydrous silica, croscarmellose sodium and sodium stearyl fumarate. Constant weight of the 
tablet was obtained by changing the quantity of diluent microcrystalline cellulose. The composition of 
generic posaconazole 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets was finalized based on these formulation 
development trials. 
Following these studies, the risk assessment of the formulation variables was updated, resulting in low

As indicated above, posaconazole is insoluble in physiological pH range. Since the selected manufacturing 
process involves the conversionof posaconazole form  to an amorphous molecular dispersion using HME, 
it was decided to generate the solubility data of the molecular dispersion to have good correlation during 
selection of medium for in-vitro dissolution. The saturation solubility of the molecular dispersion of 
posaconazole over physiological pH range with and without surfactant indicated that the solubility of 
posaconazole in phosphate buffer solution pH 6.8 is significantly low when compared to the solubility in 
presence ofPolysorbate. Hence, phosphate buffer pH 6.8 containing polysorbate was selected as the 
buffer medium for the dissolution. 
Considering the drug release in acid stage, the dissolution was evaluated using 0.01N hydrochloric acid 
followed by phosphate buffer pH 6.8 containing polysorbate simulating the conditions obtained from the 
literature search. The test and reference products showed similar dissolution profiles, exhibiting a 
delayed-release in acid stage followed by a rapid complete release in buffer stage.  
To estimate the discriminatory power of the dissolution method used as a routine quality control (QC) 
test, quantitative changes were made to the final tablet composition and varying the temperature during 
HME.  
Based on the results presented, it can be concluded that the proposed QC dissolution method has 
adequate discriminatory power to differentiate the bad batches from the good batches at both the 
specification points. Since the polymorphic form of the API is considered to be a critical process 
parameter, it was demonstrated that the QC dissolution method is able to detect the presence of 
crystalline material. 
Multimedia dissolution studies on the test and reference product biobatches were also conductedacetate 
buffer pH 4.5 followed by of phosphate buffer pH 6.8 containing polysorbate. No release after 120 min at 
pH 4.5 and complete release after 60 min at pH 6.8 buffer stage were observed for both formulations. In 
both cases, more than 85% of drug was released within 15 min in pH 6.8 buffer stage. This similarity 
(f2>50) was also observed using tight sampling schedule in the buffer stageboth with the QC medium and 
the multimedia at pH 4.5. 
In addition, in vitro studies of the release in different concentrations of alcoholic solution were performed 
to evaluate dose dumping from the formulation of test and reference product. The conditions for 
dissolution were selected based on the recommendations from the guideline on the pharmacokinetic and 
clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96 Corr1) and need for in-vitro 
dissolution studies with alcohol for modified-release oral products as per the EMA Quality of medicines 
questions and answers: Part 2. In line to these requirements, the release medium was substituted with 
different concentrations of alcohol. Dissolution of the test product was more or less similar to the 
reference product and no dose dumping from the test product was observed. 
Posaconazole 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets were further compared with the reference product Noxafil® 
100 mg with regard to the impurity profile, showing similar related substances in both products. 
As discussed earlier in the process selection, the development strategy was to design and develop a stable 
and bioequivalent generic product of posaconazole gastro-resistant tablets using commonly used 
excipients and similar to the reference product. HME was selected to prepare a molecular dispersion of 
posaconazole. The process development was specifically aimed at conversion of posaconazole form to an 
amorphous molecular dispersion which is the prime requirement to meet the required dissolution profiles 
because posaconazole is practically insoluble in physiological pH range since it belongs to BCS class-4. An 
initial risk assessment of the overall manufacturing process and justifications were provided. Earlier 
experience on similar product with these process steps was used to determine the degree of risk 
associated with each process step and its potential to impact the CQAs of the finished finished product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/354142/2019  
Page 13/26
 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the delayed-release Posaconazole Accord tablets are: impurities 
and degradants, assay, dose uniformity, water content, dissolution, and polymorphism. It was 
demonstrated that the particle size distribution of the extrudate has no impact on dissolution and does not 
constitute a CQA. 
Process parameters identified as having high or medium impact where further evaluated at lab scale to 
define the process parameter settings. Specifically, complete conversion of posaconazole formto 
amorphous form which ensures the required dissolution profile has been achieved. Hence, testing to 
ensure complete conversion to amorphous state, i.e. PXRD analysis as the in-process test after 
completion of the HME process has been defined to ensure desired quality of finished product. A larger 
batch at commercial scale was subsequently manufactured to verify the lack of impact of scale up on 
finished product CQAs. The risk assessment of the manufacturing process was updated based on the 
results of the formulation development studies, and concluded there is no risk in any process step. 
According to the guideline EMA/CHMP/QWP/245074/2015, holding time data is not necessary, if the 
maximum processing time (time from dispensing of the ingredients to the final coating) should normally 
not exceed 30 days. However, given the criticality of extrudes and that an excess quantity of (left over 
from previous batch) extrudes can be used in subsequent commercial batches a hold time study for 
extrudes was performed on one batch stored at room temperature. The data demonstrates that 
posaconazole extrudes packed in bulk pack and stored at room temperature are stable for the period 
tested. The bags comply with EU regulation (EU) No. 10/2011, the Directive 2002/72/EC as well as 
Ph.Eur. chapters 3.1.3 and 3.2.2. Based on these data the proposed shelf life for posaconazole milled 
extrudes when stored in bulk pack at room temperature is acceptable. 
A bulk stability study was performed to evaluate the stability of the product stored or shipped in bulk 
containers. Two batch samples were stored.  The data demonstrates that the tablets stored in bulk are 
stable for the studied period. Based on these data the shelf lifefor posaconazole 100 mg gastro-resistant 
tablets when stored in bulk pack has been defined.  
The tablets are packed in triplex (PVC/PE/PVdC) white opaque-aluminium blister packs or perforated unit 
dose blister in cartons of 24 or 96 tablets. The materials comply with relevant Ph. Eur. requirements 
and/or with the EU regulation No. 10/2011 as amended. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the excipients methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer (1:1) (Type-B), triethyl 
citrate, xylitol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, propyl gallate, cellulose microcrystalline, silica colloidal 
anhydrous, croscarmellose sodium, sodium stearyl fumarate, the film-coated agent used for manufacture 
of Posaconazole Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets are not made from and does not come in contact 
with products of human or animal origin and complies with the requirements of EMA/410/01 Rev. 3. 
Relevant TSE/BSE certifications have been provided. 
The active substance posaconazole is not made from and does not come in contact with the products of 
human or animal origin. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Posaconazole Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets comprises eleven 
stages: sifting, granulation, blending, hot melt extrusion, sizing (milling), blending, lubrication, 
compression, film-coating and packaging. 
Assessment report  
EMA/354142/2019  
Page 14/26
 
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. The presented in-process controls 
are considered sufficient  
The manufacturing process for was validated at the proposed manufacturing site. Results from process 
validation on three commercial scale batches have been provided. A process optimisation batch was 
further improved and the resulting optimised parameter confirmed by two validation batches. All 
parameters and attributes were found to be within acceptable ranges and according to acceptance 
criteria. Overall, the process is considered to be satisfactorily validated. The critical phases were 
evaluated and the process found to be well controlled producing consistent quality of the medicinal 
product that complies with the acceptance criteria and finished product specifications. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description (visual), identification (HPLC, UV, PDA, titanium dioxide, propyl gallate), water (KF), 
dissolution-acid and buffer stage (HPLC), assay of posaconazole (HPLC),  assay of propyl gallate (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity for posaconazole (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units 
by content uniformity for propyl gallate (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC) and microbial quality 
(TAMC, TYMC and E. coli) (Ph. Eur.). 
As indicated above, posaconazole is optically active (four chiral centres). Each isomer (SSSS, RRRR, 
SSRR) are controlled as impurity in the active substance Specifications are in line with ICH and/or Ph.Eur. 
requirements. 
Three tests for identification by UV, PDA and HPLC are included in the specification, the specification for 
the in vitro dissolution to be used for quality control is in accordance with EMA/CHMP/QWP/428693/2013 
for the acid stage of delayed release dosage forms.   
The analyses of inorganic impurities in final product were performed according to the ICH Q3D guideline 
on elemental impurities. Elements included were Class 1 and Class 2A elements, which should be taken 
into consideration for oral route of administration as well as a further element, which is not part ICH 
Guideline Q3D, but intentionally added during the manufacture of the active substance. The control of this 
element in the finished product specification was considered as unnecessary based on the demonstrated 
absence of carry-over by a validated ICP-MS method. Among the excipients, microcrystalline cellulose 
and hydroxypropylcellulose possess the highest potential for introduction for elemental impurities based 
on their plant origin. Overall, the contribution of excipients was considered low relative to the relevant 
safety thresholds in the finished product. The manufacturing process and equipment can be discounted as 
source of elemental impurities based on the process knowledge, equipment design/qualification, 
equipment cleaning and visual inspection procedures in accordance with GMP. The risk of elemental 
impurities leaching from the packaging material into a solid dosage form is negligible in accordance with 
ICH Q3D. 
Based on the risk assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. Microbiological quality of the finished product is monitored according to the 
requirements of Ph. Eur. An accelerated stability study of the exhibit batch demonstrated that the finished 
product is not capable of supporting microbial growth. Routine microbiological testing of Posaconazole 
Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets is not necessary. However, for the reason of data collection, 
skip/periodic microbiological testing will be performed in the course of routine production. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented.

Forced degradation studies are part of the validations of the methods for assay and related substances. 
Stress conditions such as acid, base, water, humidity, heat, H202 and light (UV/visible) were investigated. 
The degraded samples were analysed to determine the posaconazole peak purity. The mass balance was 
also determined. Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Posaconazole Accord 100 mg 
gastro-resistant tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing (white opaque PVC/PE/PVdC-Alu blisters), as well as Alu-Alu blisters, 
white opaque PVC/PCTFE-Alu blisters and HDPE bottles.   
Samples were tested for description, identification by HPLC, water content, dissolution, assay of 
posaconazole, assay of propyl gallate, related substances and microbial quality (TAMC, TYMC and E. Coli). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The finished product is generally very stable. No out of specification results and no degradational trends 
were observed over time. According to the ICH Q1E guideline and based on the results from accelerated 
and long term stability studies a shelf-life of 24 months is proposed.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant degradation was observed. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with no storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Following the major objection raised during the review, the 
applicant presented development data to justify the inclusion of the antioxidant propyl gallate (and its 
level) in the generic formulation in line with the guideline on inclusion of antioxidants and antimicrobial 
preservatives in medicinal products (CPMP/CVMP/QWP/115/95). Results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Posaconazole Accord is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all posaconazole containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology for Posaconazole Accord 
has been provided. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data are well known for 
posaconazole and thus new non-clinical data are not required. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in 
line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered 
acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects are considered adequate to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects

Test and reference products  
Posaconazole Accord 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets has been compared to Noxafil 100 mg 
gastro-resistant tablets, manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme United Kingdom. 
Population(s) studied 
Sixty-six (66) healthy adult male subjects (18 - 42 years old, BMI 18.73 – 29.76 kg/m2) of Asian origin 
were enrolled and randomized. Seven (7) subjects dropped out or were withdrawn. Fifty-nine (59) 
subjects completed all three periods. Fifty-nine (59) subjects were used for T/R ratio calculation and 61 
subjects were used for Intra-Subject %CV of Reference calculation.  
Analytical methods 
A LC-MS/MS method by liquid-liquid extraction method for the determination of posaconazole 
concentrations in K2EDTA human plasma was successfully validated pre-study and within study. A total of 
5253 samples were analysed. A total of 97.18% of samples were found to be within a variation of 20% 
from the mean value. Long term stability at -70°C nominal was proven for a period that spanned the time 
from first study sample collection to completion of ISR analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters for this study were AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax and the secondary 
pharmacokinetic parameters were Tmax, Kel, t1/2, tlag and AUC%_Extrapolated. The pharmacokinetic 
parameters were calculated using standard methods and a non-compartmental approach.  
Statistical methods 
A parametric ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. The ANOVA model 
included sequence, period, treatment and subject nested within sequence as fixed effects. The test to 
reference ratio of geometric LS means and the corresponding 90% confidence interval based on the 
ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ data were calculated. 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
For AUC0-t and AUC0-∞: 
The test product should be considered bioequivalent to the reference product, if 90% confidence interval 
for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ of the transformed natural log ratios of posaconazole between the test and 
reference formulation is in the range of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
For Cmax: 
If within-reference intra-subject CV of ln-transformed Cmax ≤ 30% then the test product should be 
considered bioequivalent to the reference product, if 90% confidence interval for Cmax of the transformed 
natural log ratios of posaconazole between the test and reference formulation is in the range of 80.00% 
to 125.00%. 
If within-reference intra-subject CV of ln-transformed Cmax> 30% then Cmax bioequivalence limit should 
be widen using scaled-average-bioequivalence. 
The test product was considered bioequivalent to the reference product for Cmax, if both of the following 
conditions were satisfied:

-  
Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole or 
in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
-  
Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are 
intolerant of amphotericin B; 
-  
Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or in 
patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; 
- 
Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or 
fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
-  
Oropharyngeal candidiasis: as first-line therapy in patients who have severe disease or are 
immunocompromised, in whom response to topical therapy is expected to be poor. 
Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days of 
prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. 
 
Noxafil gastro-resistant tablets are also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the 
following patients: 
-  
Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high 
risk of developing invasive fungal infections; 
-  
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing 
invasive fungal infections. 
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis, both with a randomized, open label, single dose, three 
period, crossover design.  
The design of the studies was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and 
was in line with the respective European requirements. The basis of the bioequivalence studies under 
fasting and fed conditions is justified. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time and 
wash-out periods were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of posaconazole 100 mg gastro-resistant tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with the reference product Noxafil (100 mg gastro-resistant tablets). The 
point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all 
contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of  80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information.
