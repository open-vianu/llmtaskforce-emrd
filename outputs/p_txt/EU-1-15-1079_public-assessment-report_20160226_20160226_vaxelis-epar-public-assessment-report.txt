2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Vaxelis or PR5I is a hexavalent paediatric combination vaccine for primary and booster immunization of 
infants and toddlers above the age of 6 weeks. Vaxelis is referred to as PR5I throughout the report. It is 
designed to provide active immunization against diseases caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria, 
Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), 
and hepatitis B virus. World-wide these diseases still causes significant morbidity and death, but in most 
developed countries, extensive immunization programs have made these diseases rare. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 8/140 
The licensure of PR5I in the EU would offer an additional hexavalent vaccine option to healthcare 
providers and would, therefore, increase assurance of availability of hexavalent vaccines. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Diphtheria is an acute disease caused by the exotoxin-producing bacterium, Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae. In non-immune persons of all ages, symptoms of diphtheria typically occur after an 
incubation period of 1 to 5 days. The onset is characterized by the gradual development of a low to 
moderate fever and a mild, exudative pharyngitis. Humans are the only natural host for C. diphtheriae. 
Transmission occurs through droplets and close physical contact. 
In most developed countries, endemic diphtheria has disappeared or become extremely rare due to 
vaccination. Since implementation of universal vaccination in 1980, the incidence in the U.S. has declined 
to approximately 0.001 cases per 100,000 in the population. No cases of diphtheria were reported in the 
US in 2005. 
At the peak of a diphtheria epidemic in the Russian Federation and the Newly Independent States (NIS) 
in 1995, 50,425 cases were reported in the NIS, compared with 24 cases in other countries in the 
European Region. The NIS epidemic was attributed to low vaccine coverage, among other factors 
stemming from the breakdown of the Soviet Union. It accounted for 88% of cases reported worldwide. 
Following mass immunization campaigns and additional control measures, diphtheria is largely under 
control in the World Health Organization Europe (EURO) region, with only 500 cases reported in 2005. 
Notification rates were < 0.01 cases per 100,000 population in most countries in 2011. 
Diphtheria is rare in infants younger than 6 months of age due to the presence of maternal antibody. 
Diphtheria continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in developing countries with low 
vaccine coverage. Persons in all age groups are susceptible to diphtheria if not vaccinated. 
Tetanus is an infectious bacterial disease caused by Clostridium tetani, a ubiquitous sporeforming 
anaerobic bacillus, which can produce a potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin. The toxin blocks inhibitory 
neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and causes the muscular stiffness and spasms typical of 
generalized tetanus. Tetanus can never be eradicated as C. tetani spores are prevalent in the 
environment and may be carried in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. Tetanus is not 
transmitted from person to person. Tetanus, with an incubation period varying between 2 days and 2 
months, typically presents as trismus (lockjaw) and sudden, generalized tonic seizures.  
Tetanus affects all age groups and case-fatality rates can be high even where modern intensive care is 
available. The overall tetanus case-fatality rate varies from 10% to 70%, depending on treatment, age 
and general health of the patient. Without hospitalization and intensive care, fatality is almost 100% 
among the oldest and the youngest patients. Since the 1940s, when the tetanus toxoid became a 
component of routine childhood vaccination in the U.S., reported tetanus cases have declined >95%, and 
since the disease became reportable nationally in 1947, deaths have declined >99%. No cases were 
reported in children less than five years of age from 2001 to 2008, excluding one non-fatal neonatal case. 
The overall tetanus notification rate for Europe in 2011 was 0.04 per 100,000, with almost two-thirds of 
the European cases reported in Italy alone. In 2009, there were no cases of neonatal tetanus in all of the 
EU and EEA/EFTA countries. 
Pertussis (whooping cough) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis and is transmitted from 
infected to susceptible individuals through droplets. The incubation period of pertussis ranges from 6 to 
21 days and is usually 7 to 10 days. Pertussis begins with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms 
(catarrhal stage), progresses to cough and then to paroxysms of cough (paroxysmal stage) characterized 
by an inspiratory whoop commonly followed by vomiting. Fever is absent or minimal. Symptoms wane

EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 9/140 
gradually over weeks to months (convalescent stage). The duration of classic pertussis is 6 to 10 weeks 
in the pediatric population. 
Adolescents and adults can become susceptible to pertussis because of waning immunity approximately 
5 to 10 years after booster vaccination. A case-control study following a 2010 pertussis outbreak in 
California showed that receipt of 5 doses of DTaP was initially effective but that the estimated vaccine 
efficacy decreased yearly, consistent with waning immunity. Routine adolescent and adult Tdap 
vaccination has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In 
2009, the vaccine coverage in the U.S. was 56% among adolescents and less than 6% in adults. 
Furthermore, in 2012, the ACIP updated the recommendations for Tdap vaccination in pregnant women 
and now recommends Tdap vaccination during every pregnancy, with a goal to optimize strategies for 
preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants. 
In Europe, the reported incidence varies widely from 0.12 in Portugal to 95.44 per 100,000 in Estonia in 
2010. The reported pertussis incidence among EU/EEA countries must be interpreted with caution due to 
country-to-country variations in factors influencing pertussis surveillance systems including vaccination 
policies, disease awareness and recognition, case definitions, laboratory confirmation methods, reporting 
procedures and surveillance systems performance. 
Overall, pertussis incidence remains relatively high in infants younger than 1 year of age in Europe. Even 
with high immunization coverage against pertussis and a subsequent decrease in the disease incidence, 
a resurgence of pertussis for all ages combined has been reported in several countries including countries 
across Europe. Adolescents and adults have been demonstrated to be a reservoir for pertussis infection 
and serve as a source of spread to younger children, mainly infants. In a study conducted by Celentano 
et al. in 16 Western European countries covering the period 1998-2002, although infants less than 1 year 
of age were the most or among the most affected age groups in all countries due to the severity of disease 
in this age group, the 5 to 14 year-olds were overall the age groups with the highest incidence of pertussis 
in countries reporting the highest number of cases. The overall incidence in 25 countries of the EU/EEA 
increased in 2011 for the first time since 2008, with an overall notification rate of 5.57 cases per 100,000 
compared to 4.49 per 100,000 in 2010. 
In 2012, the UK faced an outbreak situation with the highest number of reported cases mainly in 
adolescents and adults 14 years of age and above (> 80% of cases) and in infants less than three months 
of age. The UK Department of Health introduced immunization of pregnant women to control the outbreak 
and to reduce the morbidity-mortality among young infants too young to be immunized. In a prospective 
cohort study, Public Health England estimated that vaccinating pregnant women with a Tdap-IPV vaccine 
in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy had a 92% effectiveness in protecting unvaccinated infants in the first 
2 months of life against pertussis. The outbreak of pertussis subsided in 2013, with incidence diminishing 
from more than 1600 cases at the peak in October 2012 to less than 250 cases per month on average in 
October through December 2013. 
Poliomyelitis is an acute infectious and communicable disease caused by poliovirus, which occurs only 
in humans. Polioviruses are single stranded RNA enteroviruses (Picornaviridae). There are three 
poliovirus serotypes: 1, 2, and 3. Transmission is person-to-person via fecal-to-oral and oral-to-oral 
routes with an incubation period from exposure to first symptoms (minor illness) of 3 to 6 days, and from 
infection to onset of paralytic disease of usually 7 to 21 days, with a range of 3 to 35 days. Infection is 
more common in infants and young children and occurs at an earlier age among children living in poor 
hygienic conditions. The case fatality rate is variable and depends primarily on the age groups affected. 
Case fatality rates of 5 and 10% have been reported based on epidemic cases in the early 20th century. 
Childhood immunization programs with Oral polio vaccine (OPV) or with IPV have been very effective. 
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988, three WHO regions have been certified 
polio-free: the Americas in 1994, the Western Pacific in 2000 and the European region on 21 June 2002. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 10/140 
So far, the global fight against Polio is estimated to have saved 5 million persons from paralysis. In 2011, 
no cases of polio disease were reported in any of the 29 reporting EU and EEA/EFTA countries. Imported 
wild-type and vaccine-type polioviruses still remain a threat to unvaccinated European populations and, 
in fact, in 2010 an outbreak with imported WPV1 occurred in the eastern WHO European region (mainly 
Tajikistan) with nearly 500 confirmed cases. Major supplementary immunization activities were 
undertaken in all countries of the WHO European Region to stop transmission. Twelve months after WPV1 
was imported into the region, no transmission was detected within the region, including the EU and 
EEA/EFTA countries.  
The Commission which monitors the European region’s polio-free status has recently expressed concerns 
about the risk of polio importation in polio-free counties. This was illustrated with the detection of cases 
of acute flaccid paralysis caused by poliovirus type 1 in Syria between October 2013 and March 2014, 14 
years after the country was declared poliofree, and the subsequent spread of the virus to neighboring 
Iraq. As a result of the armed conflict in Syria, infant vaccination rates have diminished from 91% in 2010 
to an estimated 68% in 2012. A strain of poliovirus type 1 recently documented to have spread from 
Pakistan to the Middle East was confirmed to have caused these cases in undervaccinated children in Syria 
and Iraq. 
Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that enters the body through the 
nasopharynx. Encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae has 6 serological types (types a to f); however most 
invasive diseases are caused by type b (Hib). Hib is transmitted primarily by airborne droplets or by direct 
contact with respiratory secretions. Humans (asymptomatic carriers) are the only known reservoir. The 
most important manifestations of Hib infection – namely, meningitis (the most common form of invasive 
Hib disease), pneumonia and other invasive diseases – occur primarily in infants and toddlers less than 2 
years of age. The disease burden is highest among infants 4 to 18 months of age, but invasive Hib disease 
is occasionally observed in infants aged <3 months and among those aged >5 years.  
In unvaccinated populations, invasive Hib is the dominant cause of non-epidemic bacterial meningitis 
during the first year of life. Even with prompt and adequate antibiotic treatment, the case fatality rate of 
patients with Hib meningitis is 3 to 20%. Antibodies to Hib capsular polysaccharide are protective; a 
serum level of 0.15 μg/mL of antibody to the Hib capsular polysaccharide has been proposed to be 
protective. The short-term seroprotective anti-PRP level of 0.15 μg/mL is based on passive protection 
studies of subjects with hypogammaglobulinemia supported with gammaglobulin. The long-term 
seroprotective anti-PRP level of 1.0 μg/mL is derived from the results of active immunization following a 
single dose of the original nonconjugated native PRP vaccine, Hib polysaccharide vaccine. 
Hib infections became nationally reportable in the U.S. in 1991. Before the availability of national 
reporting data, several areas conducted active surveillance for Hib disease. In the early 1980s, it was 
estimated that about 20,000 cases occurred annually in the US alone, primarily among children younger 
than 5 years of age (40 to 50 cases per 100,000 population). The introduction of effective Hib conjugate 
vaccines has decreased the rate of invasive Hib disease in the U.S. by over 99%. Data from the European 
Union Invasive Bacterial Infections Surveillance (EU-IBIS) observed that the incidence in infants < 1 year 
of age and children 1-4 years of age has decreased in the period from 1999 to 2006. Invasive Hib 
incidence remains highest in infants < 1 year of age at about 1.1 cases per 100,000 in 2006, and 
decreases with increasing age. In the Czech Republic, Hib incidence fell particularly in children < 5 years 
of age following the introduction of routine Hib vaccination into childhood immunization schedule in 2001. 
Similarly, the introduction of a booster dose of vaccine in the second year of life in the UK in 2003 was 
followed by a reduction in the number of cases in children < 5 years of age, after a rise had been observed 
between 1999 and 2002. 
In 2011, 2,133 confirmed cases of invasive H. influenzae disease (all serotypes) were reported by 29 
European countries. The overall notification rate was 0.38 per 100,000 population, a stable incidence

estimate since 2007. The most affected age groups were children under five years and elderly (≥ 65 
years) with respectively a notification rate of 0.91 and 1.02 per 100,000 population. 
Hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus, a member of the hepadnaviridae family, which 
includes a hepatotropic group of DNA viruses. Most acute cases of hepatitis B infection in children are 
asymptomatic. Most patients do recover, but the chronic carrier state complicates up to 10% of cases 
acquired in adulthood. The rate of acquisition of chronic infection depends largely on the mode and age of 
acquisition and is up to 90% in perinatal cases. Individuals with hepatitis B chronic infection are at 
increased risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Among patients who successfully complete the 3-dose vaccination series, the clinical effectiveness is 
thought to be high. In the US, since 1990 and coinciding with the implementation of universal hepatitis B 
vaccination, the number of acute hepatitis B cases has declined 84%, from 8.5 cases per 100,000 in 1990 
to 1.1 cases per 100,000 in 2009. During this time, the greatest decline in acute hepatitis B infection has 
been in children <15 years of age, the population targeted for routine vaccination. Incidence has declined 
98% in children aged <15 years, from 1.2 per 100,000 in 1990 to 0.02 per 100,000 in 2007. In 2009, the 
lowest rates of acute hepatitis B infection were in adolescents and children age ≤ 19 years (0.06 cases per 
100,000). 
In Europe, following the introduction of universal childhood immunization against hepatitis B, the 
incidence of acute hepatitis B cases has declined over the past ten years from 6.7 per 100,000 population 
in 1995 to 0.78 per 100,000 in 2011. Revised estimates of the total burden of hepatitis B, based upon the 
implementation of a revised case definition for both acute and chronic infections in 29 European 
countries, have shown relatively stable rates of infection incidence of 3.09 and 3.43 cases per 100,000 in 
2007 and 2011, respectively. Significant heterogeneity in the incidence of hepatitis B infection observed 
across European countries can be partially attributed to the variable uptake of reporting standards for 
hepatitis B as well as difference in laboratory and clinical practices.

a) Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed 
General information 
Toxoid is prepared by formaldehyde inactivation of Tetanus Toxin, from the Boston II 60 strain of 
Clostridium tetani. Tetanus toxin has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa and is synthesised as 
a single polypeptide chain of 1315 amino acid residues. Upon cellular release, Tetanus Toxin is cleaved by 
proteases to form a light chain (toxic moiety) of approximately 52 kDa molecular weight, and a heavy 
(binding) chain of approximately 98 kDa. The two chains are linked by a single disulfide bond. The light 
chain is composed of the N-terminal 457 amino residues, and contains a zinc protease catalytic site. The 
heavy chain is composed of the remaining 858 residues. Satisfactory information on the structure and 
specific properties of the Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed has been provided. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The Tetanus Toxoid adsorbed Drug Substance is manufactured and tested at the Sanofi Pasteur Limited 
facility located at 1755 Steeles Avenue West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M2R 3T4. This site is used for 
production of this component for EU authorised product. The manufacturing process too, is largely similar 
and differences have been detailed and justified. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 13/140 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Tetanus Toxin is manufactured through fermentation of Clostridium tetani. The harvested toxin is 
detoxified by formaldehyde and the resulting toxoid is purified through selective precipitation by 
ammonium sulfate. The Tetanus Toxoid Pre-adsorbed concentrate is stored until it is adsorbed to 
aluminium phosphate to produce the Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate. There is no reprocessing 
during DS manufacture and no shipment of Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate between manufacturing 
sites. 
The hold-time for Tetanus Toxoid Pre-adsorbed concentrate is supported by stability data. The Tetanus 
Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate (DS) storage conditions are described. Container closure integrity testing 
has been demonstrated. The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and is considered 
acceptable.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while 
specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. This is the case 
for all components of Vaxelis, unless otherwise specified. Information on human or animal-derived 
materials used in the establishment of Tetanus cell substrate and during the manufacturing process is 
provided. This includes substances of bovine, avian, rabbit, porcine and human (human hair) origin.  
Information on the species and tissue, country of origin (if known) and stage of use in the manufacturing 
process for each of the raw materials is indicated and appropriate certificates supplied if available. 
Stringent conditions such as physical and chemical treatments applied during the manufacture of 
specified raw materials are known for their capacity to inactivate viruses. This is the case for all 
components of Vaxelis, unless otherwise specified.  
The Bacterial Seed lot system has been used historically for other EU authorised vaccines and guarantees 
sufficient stocks of the seed lots. Sufficient information is provided regarding testing of Master Seed Lot 
(MSL) and Working Seed Lot (WSL). Stability data have been provided. A similar approach has been used 
for other Vaxelis components. 
The applicant has committed to submitting for approval (this would be by variation) any future working 
cell banks and working seed (for all Vaxelis components) that have not been derived and tested according 
to the protocols defined in the MAA file.  
In-process controls for the intermediates of the drug substance include tests with specified acceptance 
criteria and appropriate controls for purity. Critical in-process controls and QC release tests are described 
for each step. Again, this is the approach taken for other Vaxelis components. 
The steps considered critical (i.e. where critical in-process controls or Quality Control release tests are 
performed) during the manufacture of the Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate are defined. Acceptable 
information has been provided on the control system, including documentation for the assignment of 
critical/non-critical steps for each of the DTaP components. The specification (QC release tests) applied 
for release of Tetanus Toxoid Pre-adsorbed concentrate has been presented (tests include appropriate 
tests for content, identity and purity). Appropriate release and stability data have been provided.  
Process validation 
The process validation comprises the following: Concurrent Validation Studies (to demonstrate 
consistency and show compliance to pre-defined acceptance criteria); Supportive Studies (to further 
evaluate any gaps or deficiencies identified in the concurrent studies) and Continuous Process Verification 
(used to maintain assurance that the process remains in a state of control during commercial 
manufacture). The same principles are applied to validation of DS manufacturing for other Vaxelis 
components. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 14/140 
Results show that the Tetanus drug substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately 
demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces drug substance of reproducible quality 
that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
The company has provided the rationale for the current manufacturing process for Tetanus Toxoid 
Adsorbed concentrate. Significant change(s) made to the Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate 
manufacturing process since the formulation of the four PR5I Vaccine Phase III clinical lots have been 
described.  
Characterisation 
The analyses were designed to allow for the evaluation of purity and identity of the antigen, including 
composition, structural integrity and Tetanus Toxoid adsorption analysis. For all lots investigated, it was 
demonstrated that purified Tetanus Toxoid was of the expected molecular weight and had the correct 
amino acid composition. Lot-to-lot consistency (including for adsorption) was observed and all lots had 
the expected conformation. Biological activity characterisation of Tetanus Toxoid was also performed. In 
summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The release specification for the Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate drug substance includes 
appropriate tests for identity, purity and content (antigen and adjuvant). The applicant has validated the 
clearance of formaldehyde during the manufacturing process. Additionally, formaldehyde is also 
determined at the Drug Product level.  
The purification process for Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate and other Vaxelis components has been 
designed to eliminate or reduce potential process-related impurities and product-related impurities 
during manufacturing. Adequate procedures are in place to control and reduce the impurities to 
acceptable levels.  
The consistent removal of those other impurities which are not routinely tested for, has been 
demonstrated. Several lots of Tetanus Toxoid were tested. This study also showed the effective reduction 
of product-related impurities (e.g. degradation products) and DNA/ media components. Since the stated 
impurities have been present in product used in clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is 
considered clinically qualified. 
The analytical methods have been described. The limit of flocculation (Lf) Test is performed to determine 
the Tetanus Toxoid content (Lf/mL) in the Tetanus Toxoid Pre-adsorbed and Adsorbed concentrates. The 
Lf Test is an in vitro immunological flocculation test measuring the amount of Tetanus Toxoid that 
flocculates one unit of U.S. Standard Reference Tetanus Antitoxin.  
Batch analysis data (several production scale lots) of the Tetanus Toxoid adsorbed concentrate were 
provided. Some of these batches were used in stability studies and the some batches were used in the 
formulation of the four PR5I Phase III clinical and production consistency lots. The results are within the 
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. Adequate information on reference 
materials is provided. 
Stability 
Real time, real condition stability data on full-scale production scale lots of drug substance from the 
commercial manufacturing process stored in scaled down containers (representative of the containers for 
commercial use) indicate that the drug substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life 
in the proposed container.

b) Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed 
General information 
Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed is prepared by adsorption of diphtheria toxoid, which is itself 
formaldehyde-inactivated Diphtheria Toxin, a single polypeptide of an approximate molecular weight of 
62 kDa. It is produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The structure corresponds to the three major 
functions of Diphtheria Toxin (catalysis represented by fragment A and translocation and receptor binding 
domains, both represented by fragment B). Satisfactory information on the structure and specific 
properties of the Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed has been provided. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed (drug substance, DS) is manufactured and tested at the same site as the 
Tetanus DS, Sanofi Pasteur Limited facility located at 1755 Steeles Avenue West, Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada M2R 3T4. This site is used for production of the Diphtheria component for EU authorised product. 
The manufacturing process too, is largely similar to that of EU authorised vaccines and differences have 
been detailed and justified.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed is manufactured through the fermentation of Corynebacterium diphtheria, 
the toxin being harvested and then detoxified by formaldehyde. The resulting toxoid is further purified 
through selective precipitation using ammonium sulfate. The pre-adsorbed diphtheria toxoid is then 
stored prior to adsorption to aluminium phosphate yielding the Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate. 
The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and is considered acceptable.  
The storage conditions for intermediates and Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate are described. 
Container closure integrity testing has been demonstrated. There is no reprocessing during DS 
manufacture.  
See the corresponding section for Tetanus for information on raw material specifications and general 
principles adopted on the use of human or animal-derived materials in Vaxelis DS manufacture 
(certification and manufacturing processes).  
The manufacturing process uses substances of bovine, avian, porcine and human (human hair) origin. 
The Bacterial Seed lot system is satisfactorily described. The control (includes definition of critical vs 
non-critical steps and in-process controls) system is as described for Tetanus DS. The steps considered 
critical during the manufacture of the Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate are defined. Acceptable 
information has been provided on the control system. The specification applied for release of Diphtheria 
Toxoid Pre-adsorbed concentrate has been presented. Tests include appropriate tests for content, 
identity and purity. Appropriate release and stability data have been provided.  
Process validation 
The process validation approach for Diphtheria DS follows that described for Tetanus DS. Concurrent 
(using consecutive production lots) and supportive validation reports have been provided. 
Results show that the drug substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. All 
acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the 
in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces drug 
substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-process 
acceptance criteria.

The company has provided the rationale for the current manufacturing process. Significant change(s) 
made to the Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate manufacturing process since the formulation of the 
four PR5I Vaccine Phase III clinical lots have been described.  
Characterisation 
The analyses were designed to allow for the evaluation of purity and identity of the antigen, including 
composition, structural integrity and Diphtheria Toxoid adsorption analysis. Biological activity 
characterisation of Diphtheria Toxoid has also been performed. Potency was measured by the Lf Test. In 
summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The release specification for the Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed concentrate drug substance includes 
appropriate tests for identity, purity and content (antigen and adjuvant). The applicant has validated the 
clearance of formaldehyde during the manufacturing process. Additionally, formaldehyde is also 
determined at the Drug Product level.  
See the corresponding section of the Tetanus DS as regards the approach to impurity reduction. The 
consistent removal of impurities which are not routinely tested for has been demonstrated. Several lots of 
Diphtheria Toxoid were tested. This study also showed the effective reduction of product-related 
impurities (e.g. degradation products) and DNA/ media components. Since the stated impurities have 
been present in product used in clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is considered clinically 
qualified. Adequate information on reference materials is provided. 
The analytical methods have been described. As for Tetanus, an appropriately validated in-house method 
is used for the limit of flocculation assay.  
Batch analysis data (production scale lots) of the diphtheria toxoid adsorbed concentrate were provided. 
Some of these batches were used in stability studies to support the hold-time at the adsorbed stage and 
the remaining batches were used in the formulation of the four PR5I Phase III clinical and production 
consistency lots. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing 
process. 
Stability 
Real time, real condition stability data on full scale lots of drug substance from the commercial 
manufacturing process stored in scaled-down containers (representative of the containers for commercial 
use) indicate that the drug substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the 
proposed container.  
c) 5-Component Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed 
General information 
5-Component Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed is comprised of the following five antigens isolated from 
Bordetella pertussis culture: 
 
• 
Fimbriae (FIM) are extracellular filamentous proteins. Fimbria Type 2 and Fimbria Type 3 are 
homologous polypeptides of molecular weight (MW) 22.5 kDa and 22 kDa respectively.  
• 
Pertactin (PRN) is a non-fimbrial membrane-associated protein displaying an apparent molecular 
weight (MW) of 69 kDa in SDS-PAGE.  
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 17/140 
• 
The Pertussis toxoid (PT) results from the detoxification of the Pertussis toxin (PTx), a major 
contributor to pathogenesis. The PTx contains 2 distinct domains (A & B) consisting of one (S1) 
and five (S2, S3, 2 x S4 and S5) subunits. 
• 
The Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA) is a surface-associated protein. The mature FHA has a 
MW of about 220 kDa. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The 5-Component Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed (DS) is manufactured and tested at the same site as the 
Tetanus DS, Sanofi Pasteur Limited facility located at 1755 Steeles Avenue West, Toronto, Ontario, 
Canada M2R 3T4. This site is used for production of the Acellular Pertussis DS component for EU 
authorised product.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The Component Pertussis antigens are produced from strain 10536, grown in fermenters under aerobic 
conditions. Each antigen is purified individually except for FIM (2 and 3) which are co-purified. PTx is 
detoxified using glutaraldehyde to produce PT, and any residual PTx present in the FHA fraction is 
detoxified with formaldehyde. PRN is purified and isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and is 
purified by sequential chromatography. FIM Types 2 and 3 are co-purified by precipitation with 
polyethylene glycol and chromatography. Component Pertussis pre-adsorbed concentrates are adsorbed 
onto aluminium phosphate and WFI is added to produce the Component Pertussis Adsorbed concentrates.  
The hold time for FIM, PRN and FHA pre-adsorbed concentrates is supported by stability data. The storage 
conditions for the 5-Component Adsorbed concentrates are described. Container closure integrity testing 
has been demonstrated.  
Reprocessing may occur during the production process of the 5-Component Acellular Pertussis drug 
substance and the conditions under which this occurs have been justified and are acceptable. The 
manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and is considered acceptable.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Information on human or animal-derived materials used in the establishment of cell substrate 
and during the manufacturing process has been provided and the approach taken is in line with that 
described for Tetanus DS. These include substances of bovine, avian, ovine, porcine and human (human 
hair) origin.  
The Bacterial Seed lot system has been described. Supportive information provided is in line with that 
described for Tetanus. Critical steps have been identified in the DS manufacturing process. Information 
provided on the control system (critical/non-critical) is acceptable.  
The intermediates produced during the manufacture of the 5-Component Acellular Pertussis Adsorbed 
concentrates and the specification (QC release tests) applied for release of the individual Pre-adsorbed 
concentrates for each of these components has been presented. The respective specifications include 
appropriate tests for purity, specific activity, and impurities.  
Process validation 
A number of validation studies are presented. The process validation was based on the results obtained 
from consecutive batches. In particular, there was a specific study to examine the ability of the 
formaldehyde treatment of FHA to inactivate any residual PTx after exposure. Appropriate scale studies 
have been conducted. Holding times of intermediates have been validated. The process has been 
effectively validated to demonstrate the effective detoxification of PTx. Consistency of adsorption has also 
been addressed. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 18/140 
The DS production process was designed to allow the purification of all five Pertussis antigens from a 
single fermentation using the same strain, optimised to obtain high yields. Any residual PTx is removed 
during purification. Characterisation studies on PRN and FIM have also confirmed the absence of PTx (see 
below). Residual PTx has been detected in FHA and therefore formaldehyde is routinely used in the 
manufacturing process to detoxify contaminating PTx. Additionally, the choice of glutaraldehyde for PTx 
detoxification, the chosen manufacturing steps to purify each component and the adjuvanting system 
used are all well-justified. The significant changes to the process since the Phase III clinical studies are 
clearly described and are acceptable.  
Characterisation 
Physicochemical characterisation of the 5-Component Acellular Pertussis antigens was conducted and 
showed DS composition and structural integrity. Biological activity characterisation included results of 
routine testing of manufactured lots using an identity test for PTx. This test was also used to confirm the 
absence of active PTx in the respective components. The characterisation of the antigens also included 
testing for active toxins other than PTx, to confirm their absence in the purified preparations. Percent 
adsorption of 5-Component Acellular Pertussis antigens to aluminium phosphate was also examined. 
The lots of 5-Component Acellular Pertussis antigens examined were from production material and were, 
therefore, subjected to the routine release testing. 
Specification 
Residual pertussis toxin, i.e. the PTx toxicity test by the use of CHO cells is performed as a QC release test 
on the pre-adsorbed concentrates for all antigens. The release specification for each of the 5-Component 
Acellular Pertussis drug substance is described.  
Regarding impurities, aside from those which are routinely tested for, the consistent removal of other 
impurities is reported. Glutaraldehyde is removed after PT detoxification. Adequate clearance of this, and 
absence of active PTx was shown on consecutive lots. Since the stated impurities have been present in 
product used in clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is considered clinically qualified. 
In addition, other B. pertussis virulence-associated factors were not detected when several lots of each 
component were tested. Formaldehyde is adequately removed after its use to detoxify any residual PTx in 
the purified FHA. The level of residual formaldehyde was monitored for several consecutive production lots 
during the process validation study. During process development, the level of contamination of one 
antigen with the other 5-Component Acellular Pertussis antigens was routinely measured and it was found 
that levels of the other antigens in the purified antigen concentrate were not detectable. 
The tests and specifications for the control of the acellular Pertussis drug substance are in compliance with 
the Ph. Eur. Monograph and/or internal specifications. The analytical methods used have been adequately 
described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Acceptable batch data were provided for FIM, PRN, PT and FHA Adsorbed Concentrates respectively. 
These include lots used in stability studies and lots which were manufactured at production scale and were 
used in clinical trial lot formulation. 
Stability 
Two long term stability studies evaluated the stability of Adsorbed concentrate lots representative of the 
commercial scale and commercial process stored in scaled-down containers, representative of commercial 
scale containers. The stability results indicate that the drug substance (including all Adsorbed 
concentrates) is sufficiently stable and justifies the proposed shelf life in the proposed containers.

d) Inactivated Vero Trivalent Poliomyelitis Vaccine bulk (vIPV) 
General information 
The poliovirus is a non-enveloped Picornavirus. The virion contains a single strand of about 7.5 kb positive 
RNA. The poliovirus capsid has icosahedral symmetry and consists of 60 identical asymmetric protomers. 
Each protomer is composed of a single copy of each of the three non-identical capsid proteins VP1, VP2 
and VP3. The smallest capsid protein, VP4, is located on the inner surface of the virion. The poliomyelitis 
virus comprises three serotypes (1, 2 and 3) which are antigenically distinct. According to Ph.Eur. and 
WHO, the trivalent poliovirus vaccine should contain 40, 8 and 32 D-antigen units for type 1, 2 and 3 
serotypes respectively. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The Inactivated Vero Trivalent Poliomyelitis Vaccine bulk (vIPV) Drug Substance is manufactured at 
Sanofi Pasteur, 1541 avenue Marcel Mérieux, 69280 Marcy l’Etoile, France. This site is used for production 
of the trivalent IPV DS component for EU authorised product. The manufacturing process too, is identical 
to that used for this DS component in EU approved vaccines. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The IPV trivalent drug substance comprises the three serotypes 1, 2 and 3 and each monovalent is 
manufactured separately on Vero cell substrate. Following expansion of the Vero cells in bioreactors using 
microcarriers, the cells are infected by the respective serotype. The virus harvests are clarified, 
concentrated and purified by chromatography and subsequently inactivated by formaldehyde. The viral 
inactivation takes place in two stages and is confirmed by control test results. To produce the Inactivated 
Vero Trivalent Poliomyelitis Vaccine bulk, quantities of monovalents of each serotype (type 1, 2 and 3) are 
blended in proportions calculated to obtain the required D-antigen content in the Drug Substance. There 
is no reprocessing during the manufacturing process. The storage conditions for the concentrated 
trivalent bulk DS are described.  
The type of information provided for raw materials and materials of human/ animal origin is consistent 
with the approach taken for the Tetanus DS. Substances of bovine (irradiated calf sera, certificates of 
suitability provided), avian, ovine (cholesterol used to prepare media- harsh chemical process used in 
manufacture of the media) and porcine origin (irradiated trypsin) are used during manufacturing. Porcine 
trypsin is tested for pestiviruses, circoviruses and parvoviruses. 
The Viral Seed lot system has been described. Justification of the tiered approach and storage of seed lots 
is as described for Tetanus. The Vero cell banking system consists of a tiered system. The Quality Control 
profile that is applied for the produced Vero Working Cell Banks meet the requirements of the Ph. Eur. and 
WHO. The applicant has sufficiently described passage history, the methods applied for the quality control 
testing and tests in place to ensure safety and consistent quality of the working cell banks.  
Process validation 
Satisfactory information has been provided on the control system (critical/non-critical). The specification 
(QC release tests) applied for release of the individual monovalent bulks has been presented. The 
respective specifications include appropriate tests for: purity, identity, and D-antigen content (potency 
measurement). Holding times for the storage of specified intermediates are supported by stability data. 
Batch and stability data were provided for several lots of each 'type' intermediate. Importantly, the 
validation exercise shows effective control and consistency of the inactivation step. The validation of the 
concentrated trivalent manufacturing process is supported by data from studies. The applicant provided 
a detailed description of the development of the manufacturing process. The significant changes to the 
process since the Phase III clinical studies are clearly described and are acceptable. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 20/140 
Characterisation 
The identity and concentration of each serotype is tested through the process and each batch of DS 
characterised in terms of physico-chemical properties and D-antigen content. Several lots were used in the 
characterisation study. All the data presented confirm that each routine IPV bulk batch is well 
characterised in terms of physicochemical properties and D-antigen content. 
Specification 
The release specification for the vIPV bulk includes appropriate physicochemical tests, tests for purity, 
and D-antigen content. The assays have been properly validated and comply with the requirements given 
either in Ph. Eur. or WHO TRS910 Annex 2. An ELISA method is adopted to specifically determine the 
D-antigen titre of poliomyelitis virus suspensions for each serotype in relation to a standard of known 
titre.   
In-process controls and quality control release tests are performed during the manufacturing process. 
Some impurity tests are actually used for quality control release. Additional tests including for cellular 
DNA content, and residual antibiotic content have been carried out on the validation batches to verify the 
consistent elimination of potential impurities. Since the stated impurities have been present in product 
used in clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is considered clinically qualified. 
Batch analysis data (lots used in clinical trial lots and lots representative of the commercial process at full 
scale) of the vIPV were provided. The results are within specification and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. 
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance is sufficiently stable and justifies the proposed shelf 
life in the chosen container. 
e) Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 
General information 
The HBsAg bulk drug substance is manufactured following the same fermentation (in yeast cells) and 
purification operations used to manufacture the currently licensed recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine 
HBVaxPro (EMEA/H/C/373). The protein component is an approximately 24 kDa membrane protein called 
the S protein. During expression within the yeast cell, approximately 100 S proteins spontaneously 
associate to form a 22 nm particle. The particle consists of both the S protein and yeast cell lipids. The S 
protein contains 14 cysteine residues which oxidise during the manufacturing process to form both inter 
and intramolecular disulfide crosslinks. The HBsAg particle is thus a disulfide-cross-linked, hydrophobic 
entity. The drug substance is provided as HBsAg adsorbed onto an aluminium adjuvant (amorphous 
aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The HBsAg drug substance (including the aluminium adjuvant) is manufactured and tested by Merck & 
Co. Inc., 770 Sumneytown Pike, P.O. Box 4, West Point, PA 19486-0004 USA. This is the same site as 
used for the same component in the EU authorised HBVaxPro.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The fermentation process of Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant) uses the same fermentation and 
purification processes that are employed for the manufacture of the currently licensed and approved 
Hepatitis B Vaccine (rDNA) (HBVaxPro, EMEA/H/C/373). Working cell banks are used to initiate the 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 21/140 
fermentation process. Following fermentation, harvest is concentrated and diafiltered. Purification of the 
HBsAg involves dialiftration, concentration and chromatography steps. The substance is treated to 
release impurities from the HBsAg. The product is finally sterile filtered (0.22 µm). The sterile-filtered 
product is treated with formaldehyde and the antigen then co-precipitated with adjuvant (the antigen 
thereby adsorbs to the adjuvant prior to final formulation to a concentration required for use in Vaxelis). 
Reprocessing conditions for specified steps are described. Storage conditions for any intermediates and 
DS are described. The manufacturing process has been sufficiently described and is considered 
acceptable.  
Information on raw materials including of animal- human origin has been provided and the approach 
taken consistent with that described for Tetanus. This includes a substance of human hair origin. For 
routine manufacture, this substance is sourced from poultry feathers. Reagents from bovine milk have 
been changed to a soy source for routine manufacture. 
The Viral Seed lot system consists of a standard two-tiered system of MCB and WCBs. Appropriate cell 
bank testing information is provided. There is no stability testing plan for the cell bank system. However, 
each new working cell bank is tested extensively. This is deemed sufficient to control stability of the cell 
bank system. The same approach was accepted for the component used in EU approved vaccines.  
Satisfactory information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the drug 
substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters 
and in-process/quality control tests. The approach taken for the control strategy is consistent with that for 
Tetanus DS. Critical process parameters are described for fermentation, purification and BAP formulation. 
 
Process validation 
A comprehensive process validation has been presented demonstrating a robust and controlled process. 
The applicant has provided information on the development of the HBsAg process from the originally 
approved process (as developed for the monovalent product) to the current process used to manufacture 
the phase III lots and commercial HBsAg drug substance for Vaxelis vaccine. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of the HBsAg and the adjuvant-adsorbed HBsAg has been provided. Analyses were in 
agreement with the expected sequence and confirmed that the HBsAg-containing intermediates prepared 
by the final commercial process were comparable to those of the earlier processes. 
The HBsAg particle is a complex macromolecular association of protein and host-derived lipids forming 
spherical, 22 nm particles. Complementary lipid techniques (chemical analyses, chromatography) were 
used to provide an overall lipid profile. Overall, all lots of HBsAg studied show very similar conformation 
of the HBsAg S protein, and similar size particles are formed in all of them.  
Specification 
Release specifications for Hepatitis B surface antigen recombinant BAP (DS) includes appropriate 
physicochemical tests (including formaldehyde content), tests for identity, potency and purity. The 
assays have been properly validated according to ICH (except for compendial tests) and comply with the 
requirements given either in Ph. Eur. or WHO TRS910 Annex 2. Release specifications for specified 
intermediates have also been provided. The reference materials used are considered appropriate. 
Extensive characterisation studies support the high level of product purity. Levels of impurities including 
host cell protein and DNA were monitored during the purification process validation. Data demonstrate 
that the process consistently cleared these host cell impurities below the process validation limits. Results 
provided demonstrate that investigated process residuals (including residual formaldehyde) consistently

are below the process validation limits. Since the stated impurities have been present in product used in 
clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is considered clinically qualified. 
The HBsAg master standard and reference standards are described. All standards are properly qualified. 
Batch data are provided for several drug substance lots including batches used in Phase III trials and in 
stability studies. These lots are full-scale and representative of commercial product). The results are 
within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Stability 
The stability results generated for all lots met acceptance criteria and support a storage period at the long 
term storage condition. 
e) AAHS-PRP-OMPC 
Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein Conjugate) is a highly purified capsular 
polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate or PRP) of Haemophilus influenza type b (Haemophilus b, 
Ross strain) that is covalently bound to an Outer Membrane Protein Complex (OMPC) of the B11 strain of 
Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. 
PRP-OMPC (PRP covalently bound to OMPC-outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis 
serogroup B) is used in PR5I while PRP-T (PRP covalently bound to Tetanus Protein-Conjugate) is used in 
EU licensed PEDIACEL. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture of drug substance is performed at Merck & Co. Inc., 770 Sumneytown Pike, P.O. Box 4, West 
Point, Pennsylvania 19486-0004 USA. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
In the manufacture of the aluminium-adjuvanted PRP-OMPC drug substance, Haemophilus influenzae is 
fermented and the capsular polysaccharide, polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), is isolated. Neisseria 
meningitidis is also fermented and the OMPC (Outer Membrane Protein Complex) is isolated. The OMPC is 
covalently bound to PRP to form the final PRP-OMPC Conjugate Bulk. The PRP-OMPC Conjugate Bulk is 
mixed with Amorphous Aluminium Hydroxyphosphate Sulfate (AAHS) to form the drug substance. The 
bulk drug substance is used in the formulation of PR5I bulk drug product.  
Appropriate batch sizes have been defined for the drug substance process steps. It should be noted that 
PRP3 was used as the PRP source for Phase III Vaxelis clinical studies. The commercial process uses PRP4 
(which was shown to be comparable to PRP3).  
The storage conditions for the drug substance and intermediates are described. 
Information on raw materials including of animal and human origin has been provided and the approach 
taken consistent with that described for Tetanus. Animal-derived materials used in manufacturing and 
WCBs include bovine (blood, milk derivatives), avian (feathers), porcine (blood) and ovine. Countries of 
origin have been reported where relevant. Many of these substances are produced using harsh 
manufacturing conditions which would be expected to inactivate bacteria and viruses.  
The cell bank system for H. influenzae and N. meningitidis consist of Pre-master MCB, MCB and WCBs. 
Justification of the tiered approach and storage of seed lots is as described for Tetanus. Acceptable 
information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the drug substance 
manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 23/140 
in-process tests. Rationale and justification for specifications of in-process controls and release tests of 
PRP intermediates and OMPC intermediates have been provided.  
Process validation 
The applicant has provided a data package demonstrating the comparability of commercial PRP4 and 
PRP3 which is used in clinical trials. The PRP4 comparability was performed using the new H. influenzae 
master and working cell banks (MCB and WCB, respectively), H. influenzae fermentation lots, and PRP 
purification lots. Analysis was also extended to drug substance intermediates downstream of the PRP 
purification process. Process validation of the other steps of the manufacturing process has also been 
performed. The stability studies for adsorbed PRP-OMPC and PRP intermediate from the final commercial 
process (PRP4) are still ongoing. Results will be provided post-approval when these stability studies have 
been finished. 
Characterisation 
A wide array of different physicochemical/ biophysical /immunochemical have been utilised in the 
characterisation of PRP3 (including OMPC and AAHS PRP-OMPC).  
Specification 
The panel of release tests for the AAHS PRP-OMPC-conjugate includes appropriate physicochemical tests 
for content and purity. These are considered appropriate. Additional release tests are in place at the 
PRP-OMPC-conjugate and intermediate levels in order to comply with Ph.Eur. 1219, Haemophilus Type b 
conjugate vaccine. 
The potential impurities and contaminants, the steps where they are removed during the manufacturing 
process and the residual quantities in the bulk intermediates have been detailed by the company for the 
adsorbed PRP-OMPC and all the intermediates. Clearance of host cell and process related impurities have 
been demonstrated and are well controlled. Since the stated impurities have been present in product used 
in clinical trials, their presence in the commercial DP is considered clinically qualified. Adequate 
information on reference materials has been provided. Presented batch analysis data from several clinical 
and stability lots, all conform to the pre-set acceptance criteria.  
Stability 
Data are presented for lots of AAHS PRP-OMPC-conjugate (representative of commercial scale, including 
lots used in clinical trials). Most stability data presented are from lots manufactured by the PRP3 process 
(although a lot using PRP4 is placed on stability). The presented stability data support a shelf life for AAHS 
PRP-OMPC-conjugate for DS. The proposed shelf-lives for the intermediates are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Vaxelis (referred to as PR5I Vaccine) is a sterile, preservative-free, uniform, cloudy, white-to off-white 
suspension for intramuscular injection. PR5I Vaccine is presented as a 0.5-mL single-dose pre-filled 
syringe. PR5I is a hexavalent combination vaccine formulated with preservative-free bulk concentrates as 
described in the DS section. Excipients (Aluminium phosphate and aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulfate 
used as adjuvants, Sodium phosphate and Water for injections) in Vaxelis are in compliance with the 
specifications required by the relevant Ph.Eur. monographs, and USP or in-house methods where no 
Ph.Eur. monograph exist for the raw material. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 24/140 
The final formula selected for Vaxelis for commercial purpose is the same as the formulation shown to be 
safe and immunogenic in the Phase III pivotal clinical trials. Information on the composition, dimensions 
and component specification (in compliance with Ph.Eur./USP) of the different components of the 
container closure system are sufficiently described. The PR5I Filled Product is filled in a single-dose 
1.5-mL syringe barrel (Type I borosilicate clear glass) containing a Luer-Lok adapter with a tip cap (non- 
latex rubber), and a grey butyl plunger stopper (non- latex rubber). The choice of the container-closure 
system is validated by stability data and container-closure integrity studies. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The final bulk manufacture of Vaxelis is performed by Sanofi Pasteur Limited in Toronto, Canada, and 
filling of final lot is performed by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. at Swiftwater, USA. The manufacture of Vaxelis 
consists of the following three principal steps: Manufacture of the Final Bulk Product; Filling of the Final 
Bulk Product and Packaging of final drug product.  
Critical steps of the final bulk product manufacturing process and the filled product process are defined. 
The critical process parameters (CPPs) are presented for both the bulk formulation and for the filling and 
critical quality attributes (CQAs) that are monitored during bulk formulation are defined.  
A Process Validation Study for the PR5I Final Bulk Formulation Process was conducted to verify the 
consistency of the manufacturing operations associated with formulation and blending of drug 
substances. The filling and stoppering process were appropriately validated. Satisfactory summaries have 
been provided for the validation reports. There is no reprocessing. Leachable studies have been 
performed to qualify filter equipment used during manufacture. 
The applicant has detailed changes during process development including optimising the formulation prior 
to Phase III studies. There are no new impurities introduced during DP manufacture (See respective DS 
sections for information on impurities). The container closure system is adequately described; 
compatibility was demonstrated by the stability studies and extractable studies (no compounds of 
concern identified). There is no change proposed to the formulation of commercial PR5I compared to that 
used in clinical trials.  
Product specification 
Tests performed on the final bulk and filled product include appropriate physicochemical tests including 
those to check physical appearance, measure formaldehyde content, other purity tests, measurement of 
the level of adsorption and potency of all DSs in line with Ph.Eur., where relevant. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.   
Batch analysis 
Batch data analysis from both clinical and consistency lots have been presented. These include data from 
several lots filled in vials and used in clinical trials. Batch data from several lots of syringes are also 
presented. The applicant has committed to revise certain potency specification limits once data from a 
higher number of DP lots is available. Adequate information on reference materials is provided. 
Stability of the product 
Based upon the presented data, the proposed shelf-life of PR5I Vaccine DP of 48 months from the date of 
Final Bulk Product formulation at 2°C to 8°C (in a pre-filled syringe), including up to 6 months storage of 
the final bulk product at 2°C to 8°C (the combined hold time for the Final Bulk Product and Finished 
Product and consequently DP expiry, does not exceed 48 months) is acceptable. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 25/140 
The Applicant has provided an extensive stability package, including data from final bulks, several final 
lots in vials (including clinical lots) and several final lots in prefilled syringe (all commercial scale). Data 
from clinical batches stored in vials have been provided for up to 48 months. Data from lots of PFS are 
available in two different filling lines for up to 48 months. This study is ongoing for some of these lots . In 
accordance with EU GMP guidelines,1 any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. The panel of tests used for stability testing consists 
of most of the tests performed in the release program. All stability results conformed to the pre-set 
acceptance criteria and there are no apparent negative trends in the data presented. For time points 
where OOS results were observed, the Applicant has appropriately justified the results based on 
unsuitable and not robust assays in place at the time, which have been replaced. The data also support 
that the stability profile for prefilled syringes and vials is comparable. The Applicant has committed to 
continue the ongoing stability studies as per the protocol.  
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agents’ safety evaluation has been acceptably addressed for each DS and no substances 
of animal/ human origin are additionally used in the DP manufacturing process 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The chemical/pharmaceutical and biological part of the Vaxelis dossier is of acceptable standard. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate appropriate consistency of 
product quality characteristics and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
All concerns and questions have been sufficiently clarified and/or adequately addressed by the applicant. 
There are no remaining outstanding issues. The quality part of the Vaxelis dossier is deemed approvable. 
A list with 3 recommendations was adopted by CHMP. 
Data from ongoing stability studies for the adsorbed conjugated PRP-OMPC and PRP intermediate are 
requested at study completion. Although supporting data have been submitted, most stability data relate 
to the process PRP3. Comparability was shown between the PRP3 and PRP4. Nonetheless, given the 
(specified) differences between PRP3 and PRP4, data from the completed stability study are requested. 
Finally, commitments have been made regarding the HBsAg IVRP specification and acellular pertussis 
potency. For both, limits have been established based upon the limited number of lots provided, which is 
acceptable since these limits are clinically justified. However, there is a need to re-evaluate these limits 
on the basis of manufacturing experience to provide better assurance of product consistency.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant indicated in section 1.4 of the application form that the active substances contained in the 
medicinal product Vaxelis are to be considered as known active substances. The antigens present in the 
hexavalent vaccine Vaxelis indeed contain antigens that have been used previously in other licensed 
vaccines. 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance

of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
No pharmacology studies have been performed in animals with PR5I. In view of the extensive body of 
data that is already available documenting the ability of each of the antigen components in PR5I to 
generate an immune response in humans and on the acceptable immunogenicity of PR5I observed in 
Phase IIb studies and the fact that no cardiotoxic, respiratory or neurotoxic specific risks were identified, 
this is considered acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with the EMA “Note for Guidance on Preclinical Pharmacological Toxicological Testing of 
Vaccines” (CPMP/SWP/465/95) and the WHO guideline on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines, 
pharmacokinetic studies that assess serum or tissue concentrations of vaccine components were not 
performed for this vaccine. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The nonclinical safety of PR5I(6,15), containing 6µg PRP-OMPC and 15µg HBsAg per vaccine dose, was 
evaluated in a single dose toxicity study in rats, which focused on local tolerance and included specific 
systemic toxicity endpoints. This formulation was slightly different from the optimal formulation, PR5I (3 
μg PRP-OMPC per vaccine dose and 10 μg HBsAg per vaccine dose), that was selected for further study in 
Phase IIb (V419-004/PR504) and Phase III based on favourable safety and tolerability data as well as 
acceptable immunogenicity data that were obtained from the Phase I/IIa clinical studies. 
In the single dose rat study, the PR5I(6,15) vaccine was administered on a single occasion via the IM 
route and included 1- and 14-day observation periods. The dose administered to each animal matched 
(for D, T, aP and IPV components) or exceeded (for PRP-OMPC and HepB components) the human dose 
and the human dose-volume (0.5 mL) was used.  
No premature deaths, adverse clinical signs or effects on food consumption were reported in the study. 
There was a minor decrease in female body weight during week 1. However this was considered not 
toxicologically significant and was reversed by week 2. 
Clinical pathology changes consistent with an immune response were observed on Day 2 and consisted of 
a transient elevation in mean absolute neutrophil counts associated with a lower mean relative 
lymphocyte count in both genders, when compared to controls. These changes were reversible and were 
considered not to be toxicologically significant. 
Histopathologically, inflammation was noted at the injection sites in the form of a granuloma and was not 
reversible after the 14-day observation period, consistent with the administration of an 
aluminum-adjuvanted vaccine; therefore changes at the injection sites were considered of low 
toxicological significance. 
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 27/140 
In conclusion, the nonclinical rat toxicity study conducted with PR5I(6,15) showed an acceptable safety 
profile after a single intramuscular injection. The findings noted were as expected and are typical of 
vaccines containing multiple antigens and an aluminum-based adjuvant. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies have not been conducted. The CHMP and WHO guidelines state that the need 
to evaluate the safety of new antigen combinations in animal models should be considered case-by-case, 
and that such an evaluation may be necessary if there is concern that combining antigens and/or 
adjuvants may lead to problems of toxicity. Based on the results from the single dose toxicity study and 
available clinical data, it is agreed that there are no indications to do further toxicity testing in animals. 
The lack of repeat-dose toxicity studies is therefore considered acceptable. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were performed as PR5I was considered not to have any 
genotoxicity potential or carcinogenic effect. Carcinogenicity studies are usually not required for vaccine 
antigens. In addition, there were no new raw materials, preservatives, adjuvants, or process residuals 
used or identified in PR5I compared to those in currently licensed monovalent and/or combination 
vaccines with the same antigens manufactured by either Sanofi Pasteur or Merck. It was noted that these 
substances do not have genotoxic potential. Therefore, no genotoxicity tests were considered necessary. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were conducted for PR5I as the target population is 
limited to infants and toddlers from 6 weeks of age and it is not expected to be given to women of child 
bearing potential. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The combined antigens and adjuvants are already used in existing marketed products and no significant 
increase in environmental exposure is anticipated. Considering the above, the combined antigens and 
adjuvants are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. In addition, the lack of ERA studies was 
justified and found acceptable, in line with the CHMP guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use. Vaccines are usually exempted due to the nature of their constituents. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Although the collective information on PR5I indicated that administering the combined antigens and 
adjuvants in PR5I would not pose a safety risk in humans, a single dose toxicity study was conducted in 
which PR5I(6,15) was administered to rats to confirm there were no safety concerns. The study was 
mainly focused on local tolerance, although it included specific systemic toxicity endpoints (Study No. 
407/121). This study supported all stages of development from Phase I onwards and has been conducted 
in a country that is a member of the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data scheme. For this study, the rat was 
chosen as it is a well-known toxicology species and has been shown to develop an immune response with 
similar combination vaccines and/or antigens. The design of the study supported the number and 
frequency of administrations in clinical Phase I (single dose) using PR5I (6,15). A dose matching (for D, 
T, aP and IPV components) or exceeding (for PRP-OMPC and HepB components) the full human dose and 
dose-volume was administered intramuscularly (IM), which is the route of administration in humans. The 
data from the clinical Phase I trial showed an acceptable tolerability profile consistent with the toxicology 
data.  
  
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/72003/2016 
Page 28/140 
No genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were performed as PR5I was considered not to have any 
genotoxicity potential or carcinogenic effect. 
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were conducted for PR5I as the target population is 
limited to infants and toddlers from 6 weeks of age and it is not expected to be given to women of child 
bearing potential. 
All raw materials, process residuals, preservatives, excipients, and adjuvants present in PR5I are similar 
to those found in other vaccines licensed by Sanofi Pasteur or Merck and have been demonstrated to be 
well tolerated in humans. As such, a specific toxicological assessment to evaluate the safety in humans is 
not deemed necessary.  
The nonclinical safety strategy was in accordance with the EC Directive 2010/63/EU on the principle of the 
3Rs (replacement, refinement and reduction of use of animals in research) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) nonclinical guidelines for vaccines in which it 
is acknowledged that in the case of combined vaccines with known antigens, a full evaluation of toxicity 
is not required unless there is a cause for concern. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical safety strategy took into account the extensive clinical and nonclinical data generated with 
vaccines containing one or more of the PR5I antigens which have shown no major safety issues. Although 
the collective information on PR5I indicated that administering the combined antigens and adjuvants in 
PR5I would not pose a safety risk in humans, a toxicity study was conducted in which PR5I(6,15) was 
administered to rats to confirm there were no safety concerns. The nonclinical safety strategy was in 
accordance with the EC Directive 2010/63/EU on the principle of the 3Rs (replacement, refinement and 
reduction of use of animals in research) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) nonclinical guidelines for vaccines in which it is acknowledged that in the case of 
combined vaccines with known antigens, a full evaluation of toxicity is not required unless there is a cause 
for concern. 
The nonclinical safety strategy as performed by the Applicant is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
PR5I is a new hexavalent paediatric combination vaccine co-developed by Sanofi Pasteur and MSD for 
primary and booster immunization of infants and toddlers above 6 weeks of age. It is a hybrid vaccine of 
5 pertussis antigen component DTaP, Vero IPV, Hepatitis B and PRP-OMPC.  
PR5I is a combination vaccine containing components of vaccines currently licensed in the US, the EU, and 
other countries. It contains the same DTaP as PENTACEL (US) and PEDIACEL (EU) and therefore 5 
acellular pertussis components (PT, FHA, pertactin, fimbriae types 2 and 3) in combination with IPV (from 
Vero cells), polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP, a Hib antigen) conjugated to outer membrane protein 
complex of Neisseria meningitidis to form PRP-OMPC, and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg). All these antigens have been extensively investigated in clinical trials as part of various licensed 
vaccines produced by Sanofi Pasteur and MSD:

The clinical development program for PR5I consists of 10 clinical studies, tabulated below. There are no 
clinical efficacy studies. All studies evaluating efficacy use established immunogenicity correlates or 
surrogates of protection. Three early phase studies were conducted using 4 non-final vaccine 
formulations. One Phase IIb and six Phase III clinical studies were conducted using the final vaccine 
formulation containing the lowest doses of PRP-OMPC and HBsAg (3 μg and 10 μg, respectively) and a 
modified adjuvant composition of the HBsAg component. Two studies are considered pivotal: 007 and 
008. Four studies are considered supportive: 005 and 006 (which are pivotal studies in the US), PRI01C 
(which investigates the concomitant administration of a meningococcal serotype C vaccine, 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 and a MMR vaccine), and PRI02C (which investigates a mixed 
hexa-penta-hexa schedule). 
The approach for PR5I approval in Europe with respect to efficacy has been to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of PR5I when compared to Infanrix hexa or to separate administration of the US licensed individual 
component vaccines.

US studies vs. EU studies 
Because of the diversity of vaccination schedules across the EU, it was not feasible to test each schedule 
individually. Therefore, two Phase III clinical studies (Protocols 007 and 008) were designed to meet 
immunization requirements of the EU, including varied vaccination schedules and concomitant 
administration with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13), rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq and 
Rotarix), and Quadrivalent MMRV vaccine (ProQuad). The schedules chosen for the Phase III program 
were designed to provide information on the condensed infant schedule (2, 3, 4 and 12 months in Protocol 
007) and the most immunologically rigorous example of a 3-dose schedule (2, 4, and 11 to 12 months in 
Protocol 008). Additionally, studies PRI01C and PRI02C were conducted with PR5I in the UK and in Spain, 
respectively, to evaluate PR5I co-administered with MCC vaccines using country-specific immunization 
schedules. Therefore, the immunogenicity results for Protocol 007, Protocol 008, PRI01C and PRI02C are 
provided individually. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

N/A 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
With respect to safety, Protocols 001, 002, and 003 showed that all formulations tested [AR5I (12,10), PR5I 
(3,10), PR5I (6,10) and PR5I (6,15)] had an acceptable tolerability profile. Of the PRP-OMPC-containing 
formulations [PR5I (3,10), PR5I (6,10) and PR5I (6,15)], the formulation with the lower amount of PRP and 
HBsAg antigen [PR5I (3,10)] had the lowest rate of fever and systemic adverse experiences. Therefore, PR5I 
(3,10) was selected for further development based on a slightly more favourable safety and tolerability 
profile, compared to the other PR5I formulations studied. 
With respect to immunogenicity, Protocols 002 and 003 demonstrated that the hexavalent vaccine 
formulation containing PRP-T (i.e. AR5I (12,10) did not meet the pre-specified acceptability criteria for the 
expected response rates for PRP; therefore, this formulation was not pursued for further clinical 
development. Each of the 3 PR5I formulations [PR5I (3, 10), (PR5I 6, 10), and PR5I (6, 15)] studied in 
Protocols 002 and 003 met the pre-specified acceptability criteria and were considered as candidates for 
further development. 
With respect to safety, the Phase I/IIa program showed that all formulations tested had an acceptable 
tolerability profile; however, the PR5I (3,10) group was associated with the lowest rate of fever and systemic 
adverse events. This formulation was selected for evaluation in the Phase IIb study (Study 004) based on a 
slightly more favourable safety and tolerability profile, compared to the other PR5I formulations studied. 
Study 001 
• 
Sample size 
With 30 subjects enrolled and evaluable for safety per group, if the true incidence rate of serious clinical 
adverse experiences was 1 in every 44 vaccine recipients (2.3%), there was a 50% chance of observing at 
least one serious adverse experience in each group. The chance of observing a serious adverse experience 
was 80%, if the true incidence rate was 1 in every 19 vaccine recipients (5.2%). 
• 
Statistical methods 
Prebooster and Postbooster antibody response rates were summarized, with 2-sided 95% CIs calculated by 
the exact method of Clopper-Pearson. Prebooster and Postbooster GMTs for each antigen were summarized, 
with 2-sided 95% CIs based on the t distribution, using log transformed titres. There was no imputation of 
missing data.

Study 002 
• 
Sample size 
The power calculation for the primary hypothesis was based on the exact binomial test using the 
multiplicity-adjusted error rate of =0.00625 (one-sided) to account for the 4 formulations tested in the 
hypothesis. It assumes that for each antigen, the true response rate is equal to the expected response rate 
and that the lower bound limit is as specified. With 177 subjects enrolled per group and assuming 85% 
evaluability, at least 150 subjects per group were expected to contribute to the primary analysis.  
• 
Statistical methods 
The primary hypothesis of the study was that at least 1 of the formulations of HR5I administered as a primary 
series starting at 2 months of age will be acceptable with respect to Postdose 3 antibody responses to all 
antigens. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the antibody response rate was above the 
specified lower bound limit (PRP, the 4 Pertussis : 70%, HBs, diphtheria: 80%, Tetanus and the 3 Polio: 
85%), then that formulation was considered to have acceptable antibody response for that antigen. To 
address the primary hypothesis, for antibody response to each antigen, an exact one sided test for a 1 sample 
binomial proportion was performed at the multiplicity-adjusted 2.5% significance level for each of the 4 
formulations. 
If P0 is the pre-specified lower limit of antibody response, for each formulation f, such methodology tested a 
null hypothesis of an antibody response rate being P0 or less (H0: Pf ≤P0) against the alternative hypothesis 
that the antibody response rate is greater than P0 (HA: Pf > P0), where Pf is the true antibody response from 
formulation f. The null hypothesis was rejected if the p-value of this test was α or less. The (1-2 α)×100% 
confidence interval on the antibody response rate from formulation f was calculated by the exact method of 
Clopper-Pearson.  
For secondary endpoints, confidence intervals on antibody response rates were provided by the 
Clopper-Pearson exact method and confidence intervals on GMTs were provided based on the t-distribution. 
Individual titre values were log transformed prior to analysis; means and confidence intervals were back 
transformed to the original scale. 
Study 003 
• 
Sample size 
The power calculation for the primary hypothesis was based on the exact binomial test using the 
multiplicity-adjusted error rate of =0.0083 (one-sided) to account for the 3 formulations tested in the 
hypothesis. It assumes that for each antigen, the true response rate is equal to the expected response rate 
and that the lower bound limit is as specified. With 177 subjects enrolled per group and assuming 85% 
evaluability, at least 150 subjects per group should contribute to the primary analysis.  
• 
Statistical methods 
The primary hypothesis of the study was that at least 1 of the 3 formulations of HR5I administered as a 
primary series starting at 2 months of age will be acceptable (similar to targeted rates) with respect to 
Postdose 3 antibody responses to all antigens. If the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the 
antibody response rate  was above the specified lower bound limit: PRP, the 4 Pertussis : 70%, HBs, 
diphtheria: 80%, Tetanus and the 3 Polio: 85%) ,then that formulation was considered to have acceptable 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 36/140 
antibody response for that antigen. The same technique was used for the secondary hypothesis of the study. 
The secondary hypothesis was that at least 1 of the 3 formulations of HR5I administered as a primary series 
starting at 2 months of age will be acceptable (acceptability criteria are based on the lower bound limit of the 
CIs) with respect to Postdose 2 antibody responses to all antigens. 
The statistical methods applied for studies P001, P002 and P003 are considered appropriate. 
Study 004 
A Phase IIb study (Protocol 004) was conducted to confirm the immunogenicity and safety profile of PR5I with 
the final formulation of PR5I, and the study results supported the initiation of the Phase III clinical 
development program. The study was also designed to obtain descriptive concomitant use data with 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 7-valent). Overall, the results show that the hepatitis B 
component as used in final formulation of PR5I (with the adjuvant composition change) elicited acceptable 
anti hepatitis B immune responses. Furthermore, the results support that the co-administration of Prevenar 
with PR5I met the pre-specified immunogenicity criteria. The safety profile of PR5I with concomitant Prevenar 
administration was also acceptable.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 007  
Protocol 007 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of PR5I when administered 
at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months of age concomitantly with licensed paediatric vaccines (ProQuad, RotaTeq, and 
Prevenar 13). This was a double-blind, randomized, active comparator controlled Phase III study conducted 
in healthy infants (46 to 74 days of age at enrolment) at 40 study centres across Finland, Germany, and 
Belgium. 
Protocols 007 and 008 were designed to meet immunization requirements of the EU, including varied 
vaccination schedules and concomitant administration with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar 13), 
rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq and Rotarix), and quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) 
vaccine (ProQuad). The schedules chosen for the Phase III program were designed to provide information on 
the condensed infant schedule (2, 3, 4 and 12 months in Protocol 007) and the most immunologically rigorous 
example of a 3-dose schedule (2, 4, and 11 to 12 months in Protocol 008). 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PR5I or INFANRIX hexa at 2, 3, 4, and 12 
months of age. Subjects in both groups received the same concomitant vaccines (i.e. Prevenar 13 and 
RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months of age; and ProQuad at 12 and 13 months of age) as part of the study. 
This study was designed to (see also table 4): 
(1) to test the acceptability of immune responses to PR5I,  
(2) to compare the immunogenicity of PR5I to INFANRIX hexa,  
(3) to evaluate the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered ProQuad,  
(4) to ensure that PR5I can be administered with other pediatric vaccines given at the same age,  
(5) to describe the safety and tolerability profile of PR5I.

Treatments 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PR5I or INFANRIX hexa. Subjects in the PR5I group 
received a 0.5 mL dose of PR5I along with Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months, followed by PR5I 
and ProQuad at 12 months, and Prevenar 13 and ProQuad at 13 months. Subjects in the INFANRIX hexa 
group received a 0.5 mL dose of INFANRIX hexa along with Prevenar 13, and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months, 
followed by INFANRIX hexa and ProQuad at 12 months, and Prevenar 13 and ProQuad at 13 months. 
PR5I, INFANRIX hexa, and Prevenar 13 were administered intramuscularly. RotaTeq was administered orally. 
ProQuad was administered subcutaneously. The preferable injection site of any vaccine for infants is the 
upper anterolateral thigh. PR5I or INFANRIX hexa were administered in separate limbs from the concomitant

Objectives 
Primary Objectives 
1. To evaluate the immunogenicity of PR5I when given at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months. 
2. To compare the immunogenicity elicited by PR5I to that of INFANRIX hexa when given at 2, 3, 4, and 
12 months.  
Secondary Objectives 
1. To evaluate the immunogenicity of ProQuad when administered concomitantly with the Toddler dose 
of PR5I.  
2. To describe the safety profile associated with the administration of each dose of PR5I or INFANRIX 
hexa when given concomitantly with Prevenar 13, RotaTeq, and ProQuad.  
3. To describe the fever profile from Day 1 through Day 5 after the administration of each dose and after 
all doses of PR5I or INFANRIX hexa when given concomitantly with Prevenar 13, RotaTeq, and 
ProQuad.  
4. To describe the percentage of subjects with solicited injection-site adverse events (i.e., pain, 
erythema, and swelling), and solicited systemic adverse events (i.e., vomiting, crying abnormal, 
drowsiness, appetite lost, and irritability) within 5 days after each and any dose of PR5I or INFANRIX 
hexa when co-administered with Prevenar 13, RotaTeq, and ProQuad.  
5. To summarize the incidence of serious adverse events reported during Day 1 through Day 15 
following each hexavalent vaccination. Additionally, any serious adverse event brought to the 
attention of an Investigator at any time outside of the 15 day (Day 1 through Day 15) follow-up 
period was summarized if the event was either a death, which resulted in the subject discontinuing 
the study, or a serious adverse event that was considered by an Investigator to be vaccine related.

Tertiary Objectives (Immunogenicity Objectives) 
1. To describe the response rates and geometric mean titres (GMTs)/geometric mean concentrations 
(GMCs) for all antigens in PR5I and INFANRIX hexa at one month after Dose 3 and one month after 
Toddler dose with 95% CI. 
2. To describe the percentage of subjects with titress ≥1.0 international units per millilitre (IU/mL) for 
diphtheria and tetanus after Toddler dose with 95% CI.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The immunogenicity of PR5I was evaluated in four Phase III, randomized, active-comparator controlled 
clinical trials (Protocols 007 and 008 in the EU and Protocols 005 and 006 in the US) and one Phase III, 
randomized clinical trial (PRI01C in the UK) in support of product licensure. The non-inferiority margins used 
in the evaluations were based on clinical meaningfulness of the difference, the expected response rate for 
each antigen, and the observed variability in antibody titre measurement for each antigen. In line with 
guidance, the margin for response rate is 5 percentage points for antigens with an expected response rate 
>95% and 10 percentage points for antigens with an expected response rate ≤95%. The acceptability 
criteria are based on accepted thresholds and have been approved by regulatory agencies.  
The primary endpoints for the primary hypothesis of acceptability of PR5I were antibody responses to PRP, 
diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, IPV2 and IPV3 one month after the third dose of PR5I and antibody responses to 
all antigens contained in PR5I one month after the Toddler dose of PR5I.  
The statistical criteria require that, for all of the PR5I antigens, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the response rate (%) is greater than the predetermined lower limit (P0) as defined in table 
6.

Table 6. Postdose 3 and After Toddler Dose Endpoint (12 months) Acceptability Criteria for All Antigens 
Contained in PR5I 
 
 
The primary endpoints for the primary hypothesis of non-inferiority of PR5I were antibody responses rates to 
antigens that are common to both PR5I and INFANRIX hexa and included PRP, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, IPV2 
and IPV3 one month after the third dose of PR5I and pertussis and HBsAg one month after the Toddler dose 
of PR5I. 
Conditional upon acceptance of primary hypothesis #1, when compared with subjects who receive INFANRIX 
hexa at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months, the subjects who receive PR5I at 2, 3, 4, and 12 months have: 
(a) Non-inferior response rates against PRP, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, IPV2, and IPV3 at one month 
after the third dose of PR5I, assessed by seroprotection rates. 
(b) Non-inferior response rates against pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN) at one month after the 
Toddler dose of PR5I, assessed by seroresponse rates. 
(c) Non-inferior response rates against HBsAg at one month after the Toddler dose of PR5I, assessed by 
the seroprotection rate. 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 43/140 
The statistical criteria for non-inferior response rate require that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in rates (PR5I group minus INFANRIX hexa group) is greater than the prespecified non-inferiority 
margin (-δ) as defined in Table 7. 
Table 7. Endpoints and Prespecified Non-inferiority Margin for Each Antigen Being Tested 
 
The secondary endpoints for the non-inferiority and acceptability of ProQuad concomitantly administered 
with the Toddler dose of PR5I were antibody response rates at one month after the concomitant 
administration of ProQuad and the Toddler dose of PR5I (Table 8). 
The statistical criteria required that: 
a. 
For each antigen contained in ProQuad, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is greater than 
the prespecified limit (90% for measles, mumps, and rubella, and 76% for varicella). 
b. 
For each antigen contained in ProQuad, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in rates (PR5I with ProQuad group vs. INFANRIX hexa with ProQuad group) is 
greater than the prespecified margins (-0.05 for measles, mumps, and rubella, and -0.10 for 
varicella).

Table 8. Definition of Endpoints and Non-inferiority Criteria for Concomitant Use Vaccines 
 
For pertussis, the predetermined lower limit was established by surveying results from previous phase II 
studies, other studies with monovalent PR5I components tested in different laboratories and study 004. 
These data were used to adjust the acceptability criteria used in phase III trials. Margins and non-inferiority 
criteria were discussed with US and EU Regulatory authorities and were accepted. The non-inferiority margins 
used for pertussis are also commonly used for licensure of different vaccines. The CHMP found this 
justification acceptable. 
It was noted that the evaluation of the pertussis antigens after 3 doses and the evaluation of the Hib, 
diphtheria, tetanus and polio components post-booster/toddler were explored as tertiary endpoints. 
Diseases targeted by PR5I 
For all antigens but pertussis, defined correlates of protection have been established and are accepted as 
indicators of protection against the disease: 
• 
For diphtheria and tetanus, Ab levels ≥0.01 IU/mL and ≥0.1 IU/mL are associated with the minimum 
and the optimal recognized seroprotective levels, respectively, following primary series vaccination. 
For the booster, an Ab level ≥1.0 IU/mL is associated with Ab long-term persistence; 
• 
For each poliomyelitis type, neutralizing Ab titres ≥8 (1/dil) are considered protective against their 
respective 3 poliovirus strains; 
• 
For hepatitis B, Ab level of 10 mIU/mL is accepted as the minimal level correlating with short- and 
long-term protection; 
• 
For Haemophilus influenzae type b, antibody levels ≥0.15 μg/mL and ≥1.0 μg/mL are associated 
with short- and long-term protection, respectively. 
There are no established correlates of protection for pertussis.  
Sample size 
Target enrolment was 620 subjects would be enrolled in each vaccination group, with the evaluability was 
assumed to be 85% at Postdose 3 and 80% after the Toddler dose. The assumed true response rates and 
standard deviation (SD) were based on previous studies in the program development as well as the studies 
using component vaccines. With the sample size of this study, the power was 98.8% for the primary 
hypothesis of acceptability and 94.5% for the primary hypothesis of non-inferiority. The overall Type I error 
rate was α=0.025 one-sided. The power calculation was based on the normal approximation of a binary 
response for the acceptability hypothesis, and a method by Farrington and Manning for the non-inferiority

hypothesis. The pre-defined non-inferiority margins applied were 10% for PRP, HBs, diphtheria, Pertussis and 
5% for the 3 polio, and tetanus. 
The methods applied for sample size calculation are acceptable. 
Randomisation 
After obtaining informed consent and completing all pre-vaccination procedures (i.e., collection and review of 
medical history, review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, review of prior medications and non-study vaccines, 
collection of vital signs, collection of pre-vaccination blood sample), subjects were assigned an allocation 
number using the Interactive response technology (IRT) system. The IRT system assigned the subject an 
allocation number according to the allocation schedule and then subsequently assigned a unique Component 
Identification number for the vial of clinical material to be administered at that visit. The study personnel 
accessed the IRT at each subsequent visit when administration of vaccine occurred for assignment of a 
unique vial identification number for the clinical material to be administered to the subject. Each allocation 
number was used only once. Allocation numbers were not reassigned for any reason. Randomization 
deviations (e.g., a subject being assigned 2 allocation numbers by mistake through IRT) required written 
documentation. A single subject could not be assigned more than one allocation number. 
The described randomization procedure is considered appropriate. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind (operating under in-house and third party blinding procedures) study. The 
parent(s)/legal representative of the subject, the Investigator (with the exception of the unblinded study 
personnel responsible for preparation of study vaccines), laboratory testing personnel, and 
SPONSOR/SPONSOR Representative personnel were blinded to the vaccination group assigned until the 
subjects had completed the study, the data were screened for completeness and accuracy, and the database 
was locked and unblinded.  
Because INFANRIX hexa was provided as 2 components (i.e., lyophilized Hib and liquid DTaP, IPV, and 
hepatitis B) to be reconstituted; an unblinded individual at each study site who was otherwise not involved in 
the conduct of the study was required to prepare study vaccines to maintain the study blind. This member of 
the study site staff was unblinded for the purpose of receiving, maintaining, accounting and preparing the 
study vaccines. No blinded study person(s) who had contact with the subjects had access to the study 
vaccines at any time. Site staff performing the safety assessments (including injection-site adverse events) 
and immunogenicity assessments, were blinded to the identity of study vaccines.

Statistical methods

presented in the following table:

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 47/140 
The primary hypothesis was the acceptability of the vaccine-induced antibody response rates as listed in the 
following table: 
Table 10. Postdose 3 and after Toddler dose endpoint (12 months) acceptability criteria for all antigens 
contained in PR5I 
 
For antibody response to each component, 95% CI for the single group proportion was calculated based on 
the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper-Pearson. The success criterion required the lower limit of the 
2-sided 95% CI for each of the PR5I antigens to be greater than the corresponding pre-specified limit as given 
in the last column of the table. In addition to the primary analysis, supportive analyses were also performed 
using the FAS population. For each PR5I antigen, the antibody response rate and its 95% CI were calculated 
using the same exact binomial method as for the primary acceptability analysis. 
The non-inferiority of the vaccine-induced response rate was tested individually for each component 
involved. For each tested antigen, the hypotheses tested were as follows: 
 
The δ non-inferiority limit is set at 10% for PRP, HbsAg, Diphtheria, Pertussis-PT, Pertussis-FHA, 
Pertussis-PRN, and at 5% for tetanus and the 3 poliovirus. For each antigen, non-inferiority was 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 48/140 
demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI was greater than - δ. The non-inferiority of PR5I was 
reached if the null hypotheses for each valence tested were rejected. The p-value and 95% CI were calculated 
based on an asymptotic method proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen stratified by country. 
Table 11. Endpoints and prespecified non-inferiority margin for each antigen being tested. 
 
The analysis method for testing secondary hypothesis of concomitant use of ProQuad was the same method 
by Clopper and Pearson and the analysis method for the evaluation of Non-inferiority of ProQuad antigens 
based on response rates was the same method by Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Overall, the statistical methods applied were considered appropriate. 
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
For subjects whose antibody titre values were below the LLOQ, their antibody titre values, reported as < 
LLOQ by the testing laboratory, were replaced by 0.5xLLOQ for calculating GMT. Values that were greater 
than the ULOQ were converted to the ULOQ. Missing and incomplete data were not replaced. Subjects with 
missing or incomplete data of a particular endpoint were not included in the primary analyses of the endpoint. 
No search for outliers was done. Immunogenicity data were considered validated. 
Amendments 
There were 5 protocol amendments following finalization of the original protocol and the amendments were 
initiated and finalized prior to the database lock and unblinding. The original protocol was not submitted to 
the countries’ Ethical Committees as the protocol was amended and first amendment finalized prior to the 
initiation of the study.

The introduced changes have no impact on study population and unlikely to jeopardize the integrity of the 
study. 
Study populations for Immunogenicity Analysis 
Two Per-Protocol populations (PP), PP-Revised Windows (PP-RW) and PP-Original Windows (PP-OW), were 
used in the 4 Phase III studies (Protocols 005, 006, 007 and 008). The two PP populations were the same 
except for the allowed day ranges for vaccinations (Protocols 005 and 006) and blood sample draws 
(Protocols 005, 006, 007 and 008). The day ranges for vaccination in the EU studies were not changed due to 
the compressed vaccination schedules (compressed 3-dose infant series in Protocol 007 and 2-dose infant 
series in Protocol 008). PP-RW is defined as the per-protocol population using a blood draw sample window of 
Days 28 to 51 following Dose 3 or the toddler dose. PP-OW is defined as the per-protocol population using a 
blood draw sample window of Days 28 to 44 following Dose 3 or the toddler dose (see Table 12). 
These revised visit windows for the PP-RW population allow for more subjects to be included in the statistical 
analyses for these studies and are consistent with the windows used to define PP population in the Phase IIa 
studies (Protocols 002 and 003). Prior to this change, the data from Protocol 003, as a model dataset for 
PR5I, were analysed using both PP-OW and PP-RW vaccination and blood draw windows. Importantly, GMT 
for all antigen responses were similar and the main immunogenicity conclusions from these early phase 
studies remained the same regardless of the visit window used to define the PP population. 
The statistical analyses for the Phase III studies (Protocols 005, 006, 007 and 008) were conducted using 
both PP populations. As pre-specified in the individual study protocols, the success of the hypothesis test was 
based on the results from the PP-RW population. This change was provided to CBER as part of an amendment 
to the statistical analysis plans for the US studies which was implemented prior to unblinding/the database 
lock for Protocols 005 and 006. The amended protocols for Protocols 007 and 008 were also submitted to the 
respective EU health authorities in 2013. 
Key immunogenicity summaries and analyses were also provided for all endpoints associated with 
hypotheses using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The FAS population included all randomized subjects 
with available serology data for each serology time point. Subjects were included in the vaccination group to 
which they were randomized for data analysis.

Non-inferiority margins 
The non-inferiority margins used in the evaluations were based on clinical meaningfulness of the difference, 
the expected response rate for each antigen, and the observed variability in antibody titre measurement for 
each antigen. In line with guidance, the margin for response rate is 5 percentage points for antigens with an 
expected response rate >95% and 10 percentage points for antigens with an expected response rate ≤95%.  
As mentioned above, acceptability criteria are based on accepted thresholds and have been approved by 
regulatory agencies. This approach was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
Overall, 40 investigative sites were evaluated and considered eligible to screen a total of 1271 subjects for 
study participation. A total of 1250 healthy infants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PR5I or 
INFANRIX hexa. Following an audit at Site 0048 in Germany, it was identified that safety data from this study 
site were noted to be outside of the range of results for the study as a whole (e.g. all temperatures were in 
the afebrile range and the rate of unsolicited systemic adverse events was 0 as compared with >70% of 
subjects from the other study sites who reported fever, and >70% of subjects from the other study sites who 
reported unsolicited systemic adverse events), as well as noting major findings in study conduct and 
monitoring. Therefore, all data from this site (33 subjects) were excluded from main safety and 
immunogenicity analyses. This decision was made prior to database lock and was communicated to the 
regulatory authorities 
Of the 1271 subjects screened, 1250 subjects were randomized. Excluding the 33 subjects from Site 0048, 
1217 randomized subjects were used for all subsequent analyses in this clinical study report. A total of 1215

Prevenar 13, and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months followed by PR5I and ProQuad at 12 months, and Prevenar 
13 and ProQuad at 13 months. The subjects randomized to the INFANRIX hexa group (606 subjects) received 
INFANRIX hexa, Prevenar 13, and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months, followed by INFANRIX hexa and ProQuad 
at 12 months, and Prevenar 13 and ProQuad at 13 months.

and Withdrawal by subject. Adverse events were reported as reason for withdrawal only in the active 
comparator group (Infanrix hexa).  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 26 May 2011 and 13 March 2013 in the EU (Belgium, Finland, Germany). 
Conduct of the study 
Studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice as described in ICH Harmonized Tripartite 
Efficacy Guideline E6, including compliance with Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and informed 
consent regulations/guidances/guidelines. 
Baseline data 
The baseline subject’s demographics and other characteristics were well balanced between two study groups 
(Table 14). Among all randomized subjects, 52.3% were male and 47.7% were female. The mean age of 
subjects was 61.5 days (range: 46 days to 78 days). The mean weight of subjects was 5.4 kg (range: 3.1 kg 
to 8.0 kg).

Primary analysis for antigen response specific to pertussis were limited to the toddler dose. All the 
acceptability and non-inferiority criteria for the primary endpoints were met at one month post-dose 3 and 
one month post toddler dose. Seroresponse rate differences between PR5I and INFANRIX hexa for FHA 
antigen were seen (respectively 97.22% and  99.81%). After post-dose 3 differences in the seroresponse 
rates occur particularly for PRN and FHA. Indeed, seroresponse rates for PR5I PRN and FHA (86.74% and 
89.02% respectively) antigens were lower than the seroresponse rates for the same antigen after INFANRIX 
hexa (92.32% and 96.65% respectively) (see table 22).

Tertiary Immunogenicity Analyses 
The GMTs and seroprotection/response rates for all antigens in PR5I and INFANRIX hexa based on the PP-RW 
population at one month Postdose 3 and after the Toddler dose are summarized below. 
a. 
PRP 
The anti-PRP GMT was significantly higher in subjects who received PR5I as compared to subjects who 
received INFANRIX hexa at one month Postdose 3 (3.90 vs 0.65) and at Month 12 before the Toddler dose 
(1.19 vs 0.24). One month after the Toddler dose, the anti-PRP GMT was lower in subjects who received PR5I 
as compared to subjects who received INFANRIX hexa: 6.79 (95% CI: 6.11 to 7.54) in the PR5I group vs. 
21.39 (95% CI: 18.77 to 24.37) in the INFANRIX hexa group.

HBsAg 
The percentage of subjects with anti-HBsAg (≥10 mIU/mL) at one month Postdose 3 was 97.84% (95% CI:

month Postdose 3 in the PP-RW population. One month Postdose 3, the anti-HBs response rates were high 
(>96%) in both vaccination groups, even in the absence of a birth dose of hepatitis B.  
The percentage of subjects who achieved an anti-HBsAg response (≥10 mIU/mL) at one month after the 
Toddler dose in the PP-RW population was 99.64% (95% CI: 98.70, 99.96) in subjects who received PR5I 
compared with 99.06% (95% CI: 97.82, 99.69) in subjects who received INFANRIX hexa. One month 
post-Toddler, the anti-HBs response rates were high (>99%) in both vaccination groups with similar GMT.

Tetanus 
The GMT for anti-tetanus one month Postdose 3 and one month after the Toddler dose was higher in subject 
who received PR5I as compared to subjects who received INFANRIX hexa.

Pertussis 
Table 22 presents the summary of immune responses to pertussis antigens at pre-vaccination with Dose 1 
and at one month after the Dose 3 and Toddler dose in Protocol 007. In this table, the Protocol 007 data was

concentration was < LLOQ, then the postvaccination antibody concentration was ≥ LLOQ, (2) if 
prevaccination antibody concentration was ≥ LLOQ, then the postvaccination antibody concentration was ≥
prevaccination levels. The prevaccination level was defined as the antibody titre at pre-Dose 1.

Discussion on study 007 
Some notable differences were observed between the 2 vaccination groups for anti-PRP, PT, FHA and PRN 
GMTs at one month Postdose 3 and at one month Post Toddler dose. An overview of the pre-specified and 
post-hoc non-inferiority analyses of all antigens is presented in Figures 1 and 2 below. 
Compared to INFANRIX hexa, PR5I achieved a higher anti-PRP GMT after the primary doses compared to 
INFANRIX hexa, at one month Postdose 3 and persisting at Month 12 before the Toddler dose. Since the 
Hib-antigen in PR5I is conjugated to the strongly immunogenic OMPC protein, this result confirms the 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 62/140 
expectation. However, the superiority in terms of GMT after the primary series was not sustained after the 
booster dose, which is somehow unexpected. Subjects who received PR5I had a significantly lower GMT one 
month after the toddler dose compared to those receiving INFANRIX hexa (6.79 (95% CI: 6.11 to 7.54) vs. 
21.39 (95% CI: 18.77 to 24.37) respectively). Although all primary endpoints defined by the Applicant for 
PRP were met, this lower boosting response may indicate a risk of more rapid waning after the toddler dose 
of PR5I compared to INFANRIX hexa. 
PR5I induced an early and sustained Hib response in the first year of life. Furthermore, the percentage of 
vaccinees achieving the >0.15 and >1.0 μg/ml titres in the PR5I and control groups after the toddler dose is 
similar. Considering that about 95% of PR5I vaccinees achieved a titre of > 1.0 μg/ml indicative of long-term 
protection after the toddler dose, and considering the high vaccination coverage in Europe, the lower 
post-toddler dose GMT are unlikely to negatively affect Hib disease burden in Europe. 
Pertussis 
The GMT for anti-PT one month Postdose 3 and one month after the Toddler dose was higher in subjects who 
received PR5I as compared to subjects who received INFANRIX hexa.  
The GMTs for anti-FHA and anti-PRN one month Postdose 3 and one month after the Toddler dose were lower 
in subjects who received PR5I as compared to subjects who received INFANRIX hexa. Likewise, the 
percentage of subjects with seroresponse after 3 doses was significantly lower for FHA and PRN antigens in 
subjects who received PR5I (89.02% and 86.74% respectively) as compared to subjects who received 
INFANRIX hexa (96.65% and 92.32% respectively, Table 22). The pre-toddler GMT for FHA was also 
significantly lower in subjects who received PR5I as compared to subjects who received INFANRIX hexa, 
returning to level close to the pre-vaccination GMT (8.63 vs. 6.58), suggesting a more rapid waning after 3 
doses of PR5I compared to INFANRIX hexa. The clinical significance of these GMT results differences is 
unknown. 
The higher anti-FIM GMT for the PR5I group was expected, since the FIM component is not contained in 
INFANRIX hexa.  
In order to investigate the lower boosting response and the potential higher risk of waning of Hib immunity 
after the toddler dose, and the lower pertussis FHA and PRN response after the 3 doses, and a more rapid 
waning after 3 doses according to GMT, in subjects vaccinated with PR5I compared to subjects vaccinated 
with INFANRIX hexa, additional analyses were requested (see also section on additional analysis).

Conclusions from study 007 
The primary and secondary immunogenicity findings demonstrate the acceptability criteria defined by the 
Applicant for PR5I immunogenicity, and non-inferiority to INFANRIX hexa, supporting the administration of 
PR5I given to healthy infants at 2, 3, 4, 12 months of age.  
The immunogenicity data also support the administration of PR5I with licensed paediatric vaccines (i.e. 
RotaTeq, Prevenar 13, and ProQuad).  
In healthy infants who received PR5I concomitantly with Prevenar 13 and RotaTeq at 2, 3, and 4 months 
followed by PR5I and ProQuad at 12 months, and Prevenar 13 and ProQuad at 13 months, the following 
conclusions could be drawn 
• 
PR5I elicited acceptable response rates to all antigens contained in PR5I, according to criteria defined 
by the applicant.  
• 
PR5I was non-inferior to INFANRIX hexa regarding the response rates to antigens contained in both 
PR5I and INFANRIX hexa, according to predefined endpoints.  
• 
The concomitant use of ProQuad with PR5I was acceptable, and was non-inferior to ProQuad given 
concomitantly with INFANRIX hexa.

Page 65/140 
• 
Although not included in the primary endpoints, there are two concerns that emerge from the 
non-inferiority analyses in subjects vaccinated with PR5I compared to Infanrix hexa: 
o 
Hib: the boosting effect on GMT anti-PRP was lower in PR5I vaccinees one month after the 
toddler dose compared to those receiving INFANRIX hexa (6.79 (95% CI: 6.11 to 7.54) vs. 
21.39 (95% CI: 18.77 to 24.37) respectively (tertiary endpoints).  
o 
Pertussis: the seroresponse to the 3 primary doses was lower for antigens FHA and PRN in 
PR5I vaccinees compared to those receiving INFANRIX hexa. In PR5I vaccinees, the 
pre-toddler GMT for FHA returned to a level close to the pre-vaccination GMT, suggesting a 
rapid waning after 3 doses of PR5I. 
Overall, the results presented in this clinical summary for Protocol 007 demonstrate that the observed 
responses to the antigens contained in PR5I were generally similar to INFANRIX hexa, with two exceptions: 
Hib/PRP after the toddler dose and FHA and PRN after the 3 primary doses. These endpoints were not included 
in the primary endpoints for non-inferiority but may have public health consequences due to more rapid 
waning of immunity after vaccination. Therefore further analyses were requested (see section on Additional 
analyses). 
Study 008 
Study 008 compared the immunology and tolerability of a 2+1 dose schedule of PR5I and Infanrix hexa given 
to vaccine naïve infants at 2, 4, and 11 to 12 months. 
This study was designed (1) to test the acceptability of immune responses to PR5I, (2) to compare the 
immunogenicity of PR5I to Infanrix hexa, (3) to evaluate the immunogenicity of concomitantly administered 
Rotarix, (4) to ensure that PR5I can be administered with other paediatric vaccines routinely given at the 
same age, and (5) to describe the safety and tolerability profile of PR5I. 
Methods

5. receipt of systemic immunomodulatory steroids (> the equivalent of 2 mg/kg total daily dose of 
prednisone) since birth or any dose of systemic modulatory steroids with 7 days of study entry, 
6. history of leukemia, lymphoma, malignant melanoma, or myeloproliferative disorder,

12. history or mother’s medical history of HBsAg seropositivity. 
The majority of subjects were enrolled in Finland (ca. 70% of subjects in Subset 2). Italy and Sweden enrolled 
20% and 10% of subjects, respectively, in Subset 1. 
Treatments 
Due to a change in Rotarix availability in some EU countries, the initial study protocol was amended to allow 
for two subsets of subjects to receive either Rotarix (IT, SE) or RotaTeq (FI). 
The protocol was further amended because in the Finnish paediatric vaccination schedule, RotaTeq is 
recommended to be given as early as 6 weeks of age. To allow for flexibility, study entry within the full 
prespecified age range (46 to 89 days) was acceptable even if a subject had received RotaTeq prior to Visit 1 
outside the study, e.g. through the Finnish national vaccine program. 
A total of 1315 healthy infants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PR5I or Infanrix hexa. Within 
each vaccination group subjects were assigned to one of 2 subsets based on the rotavirus vaccine supplied to 
the study site.  
• 
Subset 1 (IT, SE) received 2 doses of RV2 (Rotarix), n=231 (30% of the study population) 
• 
Subset 2 (FI) received 3 doses of RV5 (RotaTeq). n=934 (70% of the study population). The first dose 
could have been given concomitantly at Visit 1 or outside the study prior to Visit 1 (beginning at 6 
weeks of age).

2. To describe the response rates and geometric mean titres (GMTs)/geometric mean

one month after Toddler dose with 95% confidence interval (CI). 
3. To describe the percentage of subjects with titres ≥ 1.0 IU/mL for diphtheria and tetanus after

The study design did not include a formal comparison of the seroresponses of PR5I and Infanrix hexa after the 
primary series (except for PRP in secondary endpoints). The Applicant was requested to provide a post-hoc 
analysis of non-inferiority Regarding PR5I Antigen Response one month Postdose 2 using the same NI margin 
as for the non-inferiority analysis one month post-Toddler dose (see section on Additional analyses). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints for the acceptability hypothesis were PR5I-induced antibody responses to all antigens 
contained in PR5I one Month after the booster (Toddler) dose, i.e. at an infant age of about 12-13 Months. 
The statistical criteria require that, for each of the PR5I antigens, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is 
greater than the predetermined lower limit (P0) as defined in Table 23. 
Table 23. Primary endpoint acceptability criteria for all PR5I antigens one Month post-dose 3 
(Toddler/booster dose). 
 
The secondary endpoints for the non-inferiority hypothesis were PR5I-induced antibody responses against 
antigens that were contained in both PR5I and Infanrix hexa one month after the Toddler dose, i.e. at an 
infant age of about 12-13 months, for PRP, HBsAg, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis PT, pertussis FHA, 
pertussis-PRN, IPV1, IPV2, and IPV3. The NI margins are defined in Table 24.

(Toddler/booster dose) 
 
The other secondary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
1. For the testing of non-inferiority and superiority of PRP (Hib) responses: the proportion of subjects 
with anti-PRP level ≥1.0 μg/mL at one month Post-dose 2 (primary series), i.e. infant age of about 
5 months. 
2. For the testing of non-inferiority of anti-rotavirus IgA: the GMT at one month Post-dose 2 (primary 
series) in subjects receiving Rotarix. 
The tertiary immunogenicity endpoint was: 
1. testing of superiority regarding PRP (Hib) response before the booster/Toddler dose was the 
proportion of subjects with anti-PRP level ≥ 0.15 μg/mL. 
Diseases targeted by PR5I 
For all antigens but pertussis, defined correlates of protection have been established and are accepted as 
indicators of protection against the disease (see study 007). 
Sample size 
Target enrolment was 650 subjects into each vaccination group, with the evaluability was assumed to be 85% 
at Postdose 2 and 80% after the Toddler dose. With the sample size of this study, the power was 99% for the 
primary acceptability of all PR5I antigens after the Toddler dose.  The power calculation was based on the 
normal approximation of a binary response, and a method by Farrington and Manning for the non-inferiority 
hypothesis. The overall alpha-level was one-sided α = 0.025.  
Sample size calculation is acceptable.

Randomisation 
The randomized allocation schedule was generated by an external vendor, and implemented by the vendor of 
the study interactive voice response system (IVRS). Further information was provided by the Applicant upon 
request and was found acceptable. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study operating under in-house and third party blinding procedures in which the 
parent(s)/legal representative of the subject, the Investigator, laboratory testing personnel, and sponsor 
personnel were blinded, except for: 
• 
unblinded study personnel responsible for preparation of study vaccines because INFANRIX hexa is 
provided as 2 components (i.e., lyophilized Hib and liquid DTPa, IPV, and HepB). This member of the 
study site staff was unblinded for the purpose of receiving, maintaining, accounting and preparing the 
study vaccines. No blinded study person(s) who had contact with the subjects was to have access to 
the study vaccines at any time. 
• 
an unblinded sponsor representative. 
Site staff performing the safety assessments (including injection-site adverse events) and immunogenicity 
assessments, were blinded to the identity of study vaccines. 
No subjects were prematurely unblinded in this study. 
Statistical methods 
In general data were described by means of statistical characteristics (categorical variables: absolute and 
relative frequencies; numerical variables: mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) stratified for 
treatment group. Two per-protocol (PP) populations, i.e. PP-Revised Windows (PP-RW) and PP-Original 
Windows (PP-OW), were used in this study (see further below for populations’ definition).  
To address vaccine-induced antibody responses to all antigens contained in PR5I after the Toddler dose, 95% 
CIs for the single group proportion were calculated based on the exact binomial method proposed by 
Clopper-Pearson to each component. The statistical criteria for acceptability required that the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the response rate for each of the antigens was greater than the pre-specified lower 
limit. The primary acceptability analysis was based on the PP population. Supportive analyses were also 
performed using the FAS population. For each PR5I antigen, the antibody response rate and its 95% CI were 
calculated using the same exact binomial method as for the primary acceptability analysis. 
The non-inferiority of response rate of each PR5I component was established by establishing that the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for response rate difference between the 2 groups (PR5I group minus INFANRIX 
hexa group) for each of the PR5I antigens was greater than –δ, with δ is the prespecified limit for each 
component and δ = 0 for the superiority hypothesis testing. The p-value and 95% CI were calculated based 
on an asymptotic method proposed by Miettinen and Nurminen stratified by country.  
The GMT for IgA at Postdose 2 in the subset of subjects who received Rotarix (The endpoint for evaluating the 
concomitant use with Rotarix) and associated 95% CI was calculated from an ANCOVA model with 
log-transformed postvaccination titre as the response variable, and the log-transformed prevaccination 
titres, vaccination group and country as fixed effect variables. Success criteria required that the lower bound 
limit of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio was > 0.5 (corresponding to a no more than a 2.0-fold decrease in the

Page 71/140 
GMT of the PR5I group compared with the Control group) based on the analysis of covariance with multiple 
imputation for missing baseline titres (MI ANCOVA) in the PP-RW population. Additionally a cLDA method 
proposed by Liang and Zeger on the log-transformed baseline and postvaccination titre values was used for 
supportive analyses. 
Furthermore, 2 additional sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) analysis of GMT endpoints with no 
baseline adjustment, and (2) analysis of GMT endpoints with baseline adjustment, based on data from 
subjects with both baseline and postvaccination titres. 
Overall, the statistical methods applied are considered appropriate. 
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
For the primary analyses regarding GMT using ANCOVA, the missing baseline titres were multiply imputed 
using the Proc MI procedure by SAS Institute Inc. A total of 20 imputations were carried out by the procedure 
using a regression method based on all subjects in the relevant analysis population (i.e., PP-OW, PP-RW or 
FAS). The response variable for the imputation model was the log-transformed prevaccination titres, and the 
covariates were age in days, gender, weight, country, and log transformed postvaccination antibody titres. 
The multiple imputation was carried out by vaccination group. After the imputation step was completed, the 
ANCOVA was performed to estimate the between-group difference and its associated variance based on each 
of the 20 datasets from the imputation step. The final estimated difference and the CI was calculated using 
the SAS Proc MIANALYZE procedure, which combines the results and generates valid statistical inferences 
according to the algorithm by Rubin and Schenker.  
The CHMP considered that the multiple imputation method was selected because the missing baseline values 
were mostly caused by limitations in serum volume in 2-month-old infants. Therefore, the missing baseline 
values are unlikely to be biased and the Missing at Random assumption seems reasonable after including the 
baseline characteristic variables in the imputation model. The sensitivity analyses on GMT endpoints will allow 
assessing the potential impact of this assumption. 
Amendments 
Five protocol amendments were initiated and finalized prior to the database lock and unblinding. 
Protocol Amendment 1: The primary reason for this amendment was in response to the change in Rotarix 
availability in some EU countries. This amendment allowed for subsets of subjects to receive one of 2 
available rotavirus vaccines, either Rotarix or RotaTeq. 
Protocol Amendment 2: The primary reason for this amendment was that RotaTeq, a vaccine administered 
concomitantly with PR5I that was not evaluated for immunogenicity, was originally planned to be sourced 
locally by study sites, but local sourcing was not operationally feasible. 
Protocol Amendment 3: the primary reason for this amendment was because in the Finnish pediatric 
vaccination schedule, RotaTeq is recommended to be given as early as 6 weeks of age. 
Protocol Amendment 4 and 5: the primary reasons for this amendment were: 
• 
Added a new primary statistical analysis method for all GMT analyses (i.e., MI ANCOVA) to account 
for missing baseline titres due to limited serum volumes obtained from 2-month old infant subjects at 
study entry (Finland, Italy, Sweden) 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 72/140 
• 
Added a second PP population (referred to as PP-RW) in addition to the existing PP population 
(referred to as PP-OW) to account for subjects who received study vaccinations and/or blood draws 
outside of narrow protocol-defined visit windows (Finland, Italy, Sweden) . 
• 
Added 2 sensitivity analyses: (1) analysis of GMT endpoints with no baseline adjustment and (2) 
analysis of GMT endpoints based on data from subjects with both baseline and postvaccination titres 
to support the ANCOVA MI primary analysis for GMT endpoints (Finland, Italy, Sweden). 
• 
Added revised systemic corticosteroid use criteria to the description of protocol violations for which a 
subject was excluded from the PP population (received systemic corticosteroids at ≥ 2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent for ≥ 14 consecutive days) (Italy, Sweden). 
The CHMP concluded that the changes introduced did no impact on the integrity of the study. 
Study population for Immunogenicity Analysis 
Two PP populations, PP-Revised Windows (PP-RW) and PP-Original Windows (PP-OW), were used in the 4 
Phase III studies (Protocols 005, 006, 007 and 008). The two PP populations were the same except for the 
allowed day ranges for vaccinations (Protocols 005 and 006) and blood sample draws (Protocols 005, 006, 
007 and 008). The day ranges for vaccination in the EU studies were not changed due to the compressed 
vaccination schedules (compressed 3-dose infant series in Protocol 007 and 2-dose infant series in Protocol 
008). In study 008 PP-RW is defined as the per-protocol population using a blood draw sample window of 
Days 28 to 51 following Dose 2 or the toddler dose. PP-OW is defined as the per-protocol population using a 
blood draw sample window of Days 28 to 44 following Dose 2 or the toddler dose. See study 007 for further 
details on the populations. 
The statistical analyses for the Phase III studies (Protocols 005, 006, 007 and 008) were conducted using 
both PP populations but the study protocol(s) pre-specified that the success of the hypothesis test was based 
on the results from the PP-RW population. The results for the PP-RW population are reflected in this 
document; the results in the PP-OW population were provided in the dossier and assessed. Key 
immunogenicity summaries and analyses were also provided for all endpoints associated with hypotheses 
using the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population (included all randomized subjects with available serology data for 
each serology time point). 
Due to limited serum volume and the high number of antigens to be tested, samples were prioritized in 
accordance with the priority of study hypotheses and based on expected antigen assay variability (primary 
hypotheses and more variable antigens were prioritized higher). Any remaining serum could have been used 
for additional immune response testing, limited to the antigens contained within the vaccines administered in 
the study, including PR5I/Infanrix hexa and concomitant vaccines.

Non-inferiority margins and acceptability criteria 
The non-inferiority margins used in the evaluations were based on clinical meaningfulness of the difference, 
the expected response rate for each antigen, and the observed variability in antibody titre measurement for 
each antigen. The margin for response rate is 5 percentage points for antigens with an expected response 
rate >95% and 10 percentage points for antigens with an expected response rate ≤95%.

(Toddler/booster dose) 
 
The CHMP noted the following: 
1. The PP-RW population includes infants that are up to several days older than in the PP-OW 
population. Although the maturity of the immune system is likely to affect the antibody levels, the 
results in the PP-RW, the PP-OW and the FAS population are comparable in study 007.  
2. The acceptability criteria for the Hib and pertussis response rates are as low as 75%, whereas they 
are 80 to 90% for all other antigens (D, T, IPV, HepB). However, these two diseases are the real 
public health concern in the current time and pertussis shows a recrudescence in Europe.  
3. The NI margins are set at 5 or 10% depending on the expected response rate. Acceptability criteria 
and non-inferiority margins are based on accepted thresholds and have been approved by regulatory 
agencies. This was assessed and found acceptable by the CHMP (see study 007 for further details).

The proposed analyses were deemed acceptable. Since in this study only one primary hypothesis was tested 
there was no need to control for multiplicity. 
Results 
Subject disposition 
A total of 1325 subjects were screened and 1315 subjects randomized. Overall, 1300 subjects (98.9%) 
received both doses of the infant series 649 (98.9%) in the PR5I group and 651 (98.8%) in the INFANRIX 
hexa group. 4 subjects in the PR5I group and 8 subjects in the INFANRIX hexa group did not complete the 
infant series.  10 subjects in the PR5I group and 9 in the INFANRIX hexa discontinued between the infant 
series and the toddler dose. Subsequently, 1281 subjects (97.4%) received the Toddler dose vaccinations; 
639 subjects (97.4%) in the PR5I group and 642 subjects (97.4%) in the INFANRIX hexa group. Eleven 
subjects (0.8%) discontinued after the Toddler dose; 3 subjects (0.5%) in the PR5I group and 8 subjects 
(1.2%) in the INFANRIX hexa group. All drop outs where accounted for.

Conduct of the study 
There were 5 protocol amendments following finalization of the original protocol. These included 
amendments related to changes in availability of Rotarix in some EU-countries, as well as addition of new 
statistical analysis methods for GMT analysis. All amendments were initiated and finalized prior to the 
database lock and unblinding.  
Baseline data 
The demographic profile of the PR5I and INFANRIX hexa groups where comparable. Among all randomized 
subjects, 51.6% were male and 48.4% were female. The mean age of subjects was 68.1 days (range 46-89 
days). The mean weight was 5.5 kg (range 3.1-8.1 kg). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary immunological analysis (Acceptability of PR5I antigen responses one month after the toddler dose) 
The table below shows acceptability analysis regarding PR5I antigen responses one month after the toddler 
dose based on the PP-RW. For all the pre-specified endpoints the lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI for the 
response rate (%) was greater than the predetermined lower limit indicating that the PR5I group met the 
response rate acceptability criteria.

PP-RW results did not differ significantly from those obtained using PP-OW.  Similar findings were observed 
for the PP-OW and the FAS populations.

[1] The pertussis seroresponse was defined as follows: (1) If prevaccination antibody concentration was < 4X LLOQ, then 
the postvaccination antibody concentration was ≥ 4X LLOQ, (2) If prevaccination antibody concentration was ≥ 4X LLOQ, 
then the postvaccination antibody concentration was ≥ prevaccination levels. The prevaccination level was defined as the 
antibody titre at pre-Dose 1. [2] 95% CI and p-value were calculated based on an exact binomial method by Clopper and 
Pearson. Subjects received PR5I at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months; RotaTeq at 2, 3 and 4 months; Prevenar 13 at 2, 3, 4 and 13 
months; ProQuad at 12 and 13 months. LLOQ = Lower limit of quantification, N = Number of vaccinated subjects, n = 
Number of subjects included in the analysis, Nab = Neutralizing antibodies. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses  
(a) 
Non-inferiority/superiority analysis of PRP antigen responses at one month post dose 2 
The proportion of subjects with anti-PRP ≥1.0 μg/mL one month Postdose 2 was 72.86% for the PR5I group 
versus 26.66 for the INFANRIX hexa group.  The difference (PR5I group minus INFANRIX hexa group) in the 
proportion of subjects with anti-PRP ≥1.0 μg/mL one month Postdose 2 was 46.20% (95% CI: 41.05% to 
51.06%; p-value <0.001); the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in response rates (PR5I 
group minus INFANRIX hexa group) was > 0, thus > -10%, indicating that both non-inferiority and 
superiority criteria were met. See tables below.

1] The pertussis seroresponse was defined as follows: (1) If pre-vaccination antibody concentration was < LLOQ, then the post-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥ 
LLOQ, (2) If pre-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥ LLOQ, then the post-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥ pre-vaccination levels. The pre-vaccination level 
was defined as the antibody titre at pre-Dose 1. 
[2] The estimates for the response rate, rate difference (PR5I group minus INFANRIX hexa group), 95% CI and p-value were based on the method by Miettinen and 
Nurminen stratified by country. Subset 1 consisted of subjects receiving Rotarix (Italy and Sweden); Subset 2 consisted of subjects receiving RotaTeq (Finland). Subjects 
received PR5I / INFANRIX hexa + Prevenar 13 at 2, 4 and 11 to 12 mos; Rotarix at 2 and 4 mos (Subjects in Subset 1); RotaTeq at 2, 4 and 5 mos (Subjects in Subset 2). 
The first dose of RotaTeq given at 2 mos can be received prior to enrollment to the study according to the protocol. CI = Confidence interval, FHA = Filamentous 
haemagglutinin, HBsAg = Hepatitis B surface antigen, IPV = Inactivated poliovirus, LLOQ = Lower limit of quantification, mos = Months, N = Number of vaccinated 
subjects, n = Number of subjects included in the analysis, NAb = Neutralizing antibodies, NI = Non-inferiority, PP-RW = Per-protocol-Revised Windows (defined as a blood 
draw sample window of Days 28 to 51 following Dose 2 or the toddler dose), PRN = Pertactin, PRP = Polyribosylribitol phosphate, PT = Pertussis toxoid. 
 
The lower limit of the 2 sided 95% CI for the difference in response rates (PR5I group minus INFANRIX hexa 
group) was greater than the prespecified non-inferiority margin regarding all prespecified endpoints, 
indicating that the PR5I group was non inferior to the INFANRIX hexa group.  
Results presented above for the PP-RW have been confirmed in the PP-OW as well as the FAS.

Non-Inferiority Analysis Regarding Concomitant Use of PR5I and Rotarix at One Month Postdose 2 
Non-inferiority analysis regarding the concomitant use of PR5I and Rotarix one month Postdose 2 based on 
the PP-RW population is provided for Subset 1 in Table 35. The anti-rotavirus IgA GMT ratio (PR5I group/ 
INFANRIX hexa group) one month Postdose 2 was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.54 to 1.20; p-value = 0.011); the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMT ratio (PR5I group / INFANRIX hexa group) was > 0.50 indicating that the 
non-inferiority criterion was met. Similar findings were observed for the PP-OW and the FAS populations.

Discussion on Study 008  
The study outline and conduct were adequate to assess the immunogenicity of PR5I and its non-inferiority to 
INFANRIX hexa, when given to healthy infants at 2, 4 and 11-12 months of age. 
The immunogenicity data also support the administration of PR5I with licensed peadiatric vaccines (i.e. 
RotaTeq, Prevenar 13, and ProQuad).  
The data from this study indicates slightly lower immune responses towards most PR5I antigens using the 2, 
4 months infant series followed by a toddler dose at 11 to 12 months, as compared to the 2, 3 and 4 months 
followed by a toddler dose at 12 months used in study 007.  
The main conclusion regarding immunogenicity findings in the study were the following: 
• 
Acceptable response rates to all antigens contained in PR5I were elicited at one month following the 
Toddler dose.  
• 
PR5I was non-inferior to INFANRIX hexa regarding the response rates to antigens contained in both 
vaccines at one month after the Toddler dose. 
• 
Immune responses to Rotarix in subjects who received it concomitantly with either PR5I or INFANRIX 
hexa met the non-inferiority criterion.  
• 
PR5I was superior to INFANRIX hexa regarding the response rates to PRP antigen (% ≥ 1.0 μg/mL) 
at one month Postdose 2. Nevertheless,  response rates  to PRP antigen were lower than those 
observed at one month postdose 3 in study 007, which used the 2, 3, 4 infant schedule. Although 
dose response rates and PRP GMTs in study 008 were lower in the PR5I group than in the INFANRIX 
hexa group following the toddler dose, the difference between the two vaccination groups was less 
pronounced than observed in study 007.  
• 
Anti-HBs antibody responses were somewhat weaker than observed in study 007. Reverse 
cumulative distribution curves showed a trend towards lower anti Hepatitis B immune responses in 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 83/140 
the PR5I versus INFANRIX hexa groups. Similar differences was not observed in the in the 007 study. 
It is unclear whether the somewhat lower immune response for the PR5I group would have any 
clinical significance since the immunological memory persist beyond the detection of antibodies and 
the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies may therefore not be the most appropriate surrogate of long 
term protection. The long term persistence of anti-HBs immunity may need to be evaluated in future 
studies. 
• 
One month post dose 2 and one month post toddler dose, pertussis FHA and PRN response rates were 
lower with 95% confidence intervals not overlapping. FHA and PRN GMT were about 50% lower. Prior 
to the Toddler dose, the pertussis response rates for all shared antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) were lower 
in the PR5I compared to the Infanrix hexa group (see Table 33). For FHA and PRN, the GMT (8.09 and 
6.53, respectively) returned to levels very close to the pre-vaccine GMT (6.41 and 4.57, 
respectively).  
• 
After the Toddler dose, the pertussis antibody response rates were similar in the PR5I and Infanrix 
hexa groups for all shared antigens (PT, FHA, PRN). A slightly lower response rate was observed to 
the FHA antigen, but was still within the non-inferiority margin. 
• 
One month post dose 2 the response rates and GMTs of IPV1 and IPV3 were lower. However, after the 
Toddler dose the response rates to all three poliovirus antigens were very similar between both 
groups. 
The possible clinical relevance of the trends toward lower immune responses following the 2, 4 and 11-12 
month dosing regimen, and potential consequences for dosing recommendations was assessed during the 
procedure and is discussed further in the following sections.

Hypothesis 
Primary Hypotheses : 
1. Acceptability of the vaccine-induced antibody response rates to 
polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), diphtheria, tetanus, inactivated poliovirus 
(IPV) Type 1, IPV Type 2, and IPV Type 3 at one month after the third dose of 
PR5I and to all antigens contained in PR5I at one month after the Toddler dose 
of PR5I. 
2. Immunologic Non-inferiority of PR5I to INFANRIX hexa is considered to 
be demonstrated if the subjects have : 
- 
Non-inferior response rates against PRP, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV1, 
IPV2, and IPV3 at one month after the third dose of PR5I, assessed by 
seroprotection rates. 
- 
Non-inferior response rates against pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and 
PRN) at one month after the Toddler dose of PR5I, assessed by 
seroresponse rates. 
- 
Non-inferior response rates against HBsAg at one month after the 
Toddler dose of 
PR5I, assessed by the seroprotection rate. 
Secondary Hypotheses : 
Immunogenicity of ProQuad in subjects who receive it concomitantly with PR5I 
is acceptable and non-inferior to the responses observed in subjects who 
receive ProQuad concomitantly with INFANRIX hexa at one month after the 
Toddler dose of PR5I or the Control.

Notes 
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the group difference (PR5I group minus 
INFANRIX hexa group) was above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin regarding 
all pre-specified endpoints, indicating that the PR5I group was non-inferior to the 
INFANRIX hexa group. 
Furthermore, the group difference regarding anti-PRP ≥ 0.15 μg/mL one month 
Postdose 3 was 11.37% (95% CI: 8.44% to 14.68%; p < 0.001) with its entire 95% 
CI above 0, suggesting a superior anti-PRP response elicited by PR5I Postdose 3 
compared to INFANRIX Postdose 3.

can be received prior to enrollment to the study according to the protocol. 
Endpoints and 
definitions 
 
Primary 
endpoint 
 
Response 
rate (%) 
 
Subjects who receive PR5I at 2, 4, and 11 to 12 
months have an acceptable response rate to 
all PR5I-contained antigens at one month 
after the Toddler dose of PR5I. The 
statistical criteria require that, for each of the 
PR5I antigens, the lower limit of the 2-sided 
95% CI is greater than the predetermined 
lower limit (P0) as defined in Table 6 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 90/140 
Secondary 
endpoint 1 
Response 
rate (%) 
 
At one month after the second dose, the 
anti-PRP response (% ≥ 1.0 μg/mL) elicited by 
PR5I is non-inferior to that elicited by 
Infanrix hexa. The statistical criteria require 
that the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the differences in rates (PR5I group minus 
Infanrix hexa group) is > -0.10. 
Conditional upon acceptance of Secondary 
Hypothesis #1, the anti-PRP response (% ≥ 
1.0 μg/mL) elicited by PR5I is superior to that 
elicited by Infanrix hexa at one month after the 
second dose of PR5I or Infanrix hexa. The 
statistical criteria require that the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the differences in rates 
(PR5I group minus Infanrix hexa group) is > 0. 
Secondary 
endpoint 2 
Response 
rate (%) 
 
When compared with subjects who receive 
Infanrix hexa at 2, 4, and 11 to 12 months, the 
subjects who received PR5I at 2, 4, and 11 to 
12 months must have: 
- non-inferior response rates against 
PRP, HBsAg, diphtheria, tetanus, IPV 
Type 1, IPV Type 2, and IPV Type 3 at 
one month after the Toddler dose 
of PR5I, assessed by seroprotection 
rates. 
- non-inferior response rates against 
pertussis-pertussis-PT), 
pertussis-FHA, and pertussis-pertactin 
PRN at one month after the Toddler 
dose of PR5I, assessed by 
seroresponse rates.  
The statistical criteria for non-inferior response 
rate require that, for each of the PR5I 
antigens, the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI 
of the difference in rates (PR5I group minus 
Infanrix hexa group) is greater than the 
prespecified margin (-δ) as defined. 
 
Secondary 
endpoint 3 
GMT ratio 
The immunogenicity of Rotarix in subjects 
who receive it concomitantly with PR5I as an 
infant series at 2 and 4 months is non-inferior 
to the responses observed in subjects who 
receive Rotarix concomitantly with the Control 
at one month after the second dose of 
PR5I/Infanrix hexa. 
The statistical criteria require that the lower 
limit of the 2-sided 95% CI of the 
anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A (IgA) GMT 
ratio (PR5I/Infanrix hexa) is > 0.50. 
(data not shown in 
this table) 
Tertiary 
endpoint 1 
Response 
rate (%) 
 
The anti-PRP response (% ≥ 0.15 μg/mL) 
elicited by PR5I before the Toddler dose 
(~12 months) is superior to that elicited by 
Infanrix hexa at the same time point. The 
statistical criteria require that the lower limit of 
the 2-sided 95% CI of the differences in rates 
(PR5I group minus Infanrix hexa group) is > 0.

Acceptability criteria 
The lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the response rate (%) was greater 
than the predetermined lower limit regarding all prespecified endpoints, 
indicating that the PR5I group met the response rate acceptability criteria. 
Pertussis seroresponse 
The pertussis seroresponse was defined as follows: (1) If pre-vaccination 
antibody concentration was < LLOQ, then the post-vaccination antibody 
concentration was ≥ LLOQ, (2) If pre-vaccination antibody concentration was 
≥ LLOQ, then the post-vaccination antibody concentration was ≥ 
pre-vaccination levels. The pre-vaccination level was defined as the antibody 
titre at pre- Dose 1.

vaccination at birth; 2, 3, 4 months of age without hepatitis B vaccination at birth; 2, 4, 6 months of age with 
and without hepatitis B vaccination at birth. The booster dose in clinical studies was given at 11-12 months 
after a 2-dose primary series or at 12 months of age after a 3-dose primary series vaccination. Results 
obtained for each component of the vaccine are summarised across studies in Table 38 and Table 39.

2.5.4.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Specific studies in special populations were not carried out. 
Premature infants 
Premature infants were not excluded from the Phase 3 studies. The gestational age was not collected. As the 
number of subjects identified as premature (“Premature baby”, “Premature delivery” and/or “Low birth 
weight baby”) is small compared to the overall study population, immunogenicity information is provided 
descriptively. No formal statistical comparisons were planned between PR5I and control within premature 
infants, or between the premature infant groups and the studies as a whole. 
In the Phase 3 studies, a total of 111 subjects in the PR5I group and 49 subjects in the Control group had 
medical history terms consistent with prematurity.  
Overall, although the numbers are small, the data indicate that a high percentage of premature infants 
mounted protective immune responses to antigens that have a well-defined correlate of protection. A high 
percentage also achieved protocol-defined vaccine response against pertussis. 
Ethnicity 
The studies have been performed in several European countries, which is considered a sufficient justification 
of the applicability of the available study data to the European population.  
Immunocompromised infants 
Immunocompromised infants were excluded from studies. This aspect is added as missing information in the 
Risk Management Plan (see further below). 
2.5.5.  Supportive studies 
Study 005 
• 
Study design 
Study V419-005 served as a pivotal immunogenicity study in the US. The study design assessed the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of PR5I compared to the component vaccine control(s) (US 
standard-of-care) when given as an infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months of age followed by a Toddler dose of 
DAPTACEL and PedvaxHIB at 15 months of age and when administered concomitantly with licensed pediatric 
vaccines (Prevnar 13 and RotaTeq). 
The comparator arm of the study represented the current standard-of-care in the USA with PENTACEL 
administered as an infant series at 2, 4, and 6 months, with RECOMBIVAX HB administered separately at 2 
and 6 months. The infant series of PR5I and PENTACEL was followed by a Toddler dose of DAPTACEL (Sanofi 
Pasteur Ltd) and Hib conjugate vaccine at 15 months of age. PedvaxHIB (PRP-OMPC conjugate, Merck) 
completed the PR5I infant series and ActHIB (PRP-TT conjugate, Sanofi Pasteur Ltd) completed PENTACEL to 
preserve antigenic continuity throughout the Hib vaccination series. However, PedvaxHIB is alum adjuvanted 
whereas ActHIB is not. 
A PR5I regimen was compared to a 4-dose regimen of PENTACEL in a separate study (V419-006). 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 101/140 
The concomitant administration of standard-of-care, licensed pediatric vaccines (Prevnar 13 and 
RotaTeq) with PR5I or the component vaccine Control(s) was evaluated in all study participants. The 
response rates to the PR5I antigens were compared to the component vaccine Control(s) to provide 
information on the compatibility of PR5I when given concomitantly with both Prevnar 13 and RotaTeq during 
the infant series. Additionally, the immunogenicity of concomitant RotaTeq was evaluated in this study. The 
immunogenicity of concomitant administration with Prevnar 13 was evaluated in another study in the Phase 
III program (V419-006). 
This study was to provide evidence of immune protection after the complete infant vaccination series for 
hepatitis B to be consistent with the medical need for protection against hepatitis B exposure. This study was 
also to provide immunogenicity data in the presence of a birth dose of a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine, 
which represents the standard-of-care in the USA. 
• 
Primary analysis 
Non-inferiority criteria of the PR5I antigen responses and GMTs one month post-primary series were met for 
all PR5I antigens except for FHA GMTs. 
Non-inferiority criteria of the PR5I antigen responses and GMTs one month post-Toddler dose were met for all 
PR5I antigens, although this has not been defined as a primary analysis. 
Non-inferiority criteria of the pertussis antigen responses and GMTs one month post-Toddler dose were met 
for all pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, FIM).  
Acceptability criteria of the IPV antigen responses in the PR5I group one month post-primary series were met 
for IPV 1, IPV2 and IPV3. 
The results were consistent in the PP-RW, PP-OW and FAS populations. 
PR5I is not used in a post-toddler/booster dose in study 005, but Daptacel is administered as booster, and the 
separate Hib-containing vaccine used for the booster dose varies between the two groups: PedvaxHiB is used 
as booster at 15 months in the PR5I group, and ActHIB is used as booster in the control group. Analyses of 
post-toddler endpoint for PRP/Hib are thus difficult to interpret because the immune responses post-booster 
result from the combined effect of four different vaccines (PR5I or Pentacel as primary series, PedvaxHiB or 
ActHIB as booster).  
One month post-primary series the FHA GMTs are lower in the PR5I group than in the control group, and as 
a result the primary endpoint for FHA GMTs is not met in the primary analysis of US pivotal study 005. 
Likewise, the pre-toddler dose GMT for FHA in the PR5I group returned to pre-vaccination levels, i.e 6.3 and 
6.9 for pre-toddler and pre-vaccination GMT respectively, and was twice higher before the toddler dose in the 
control group (13.2), suggesting a more rapid waning after a primary series of PR5I compared to the 
comparator, as the same vaccine (DAPTACEL) was used for boosting the pertussis response (data not shown 
in this report). A similar observation was made in the EU pivotal studies 007 and 008 in the tertiary analysis, 
respectively, although non-inferiority criteria were not defined.  
One month post-Toddler dose, the non-inferiority criteria for pertussis were met. 
The proportion of subjects with anti-PRP ≥ 1.0 μg/mL one month after the Toddler dose (indicative of 
long-term protection for Hib) was about 95% for both PR5I and control, whereas PR5I GMTs were inferior.

EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 102/140 
Study 006 
PR5I is not used in a post-toddler/booster dose in study 006, but the vaccine used as booster (Pentacel) is the 
same in the two groups. Analyses of post-toddler endpoint (secondary objective for pertussis and tertiary for 
all antigens) can thus be meaningful to compare the priming effect of PR5I and the comparator, because the 
two groups receive the same vaccine as booster.  
PR5I induced an acceptable immune response against all disease antigens contained in PR5I except for FHA.  
The immune response to a 3-dose infant series of PR5I was comparable to vaccination with a licensed Control 
regimen for all prespecified endpoints, except for the GMT of the FHA antigen.  
PR5I includes polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated to outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria 
meningitidis (OMPC) that elicits a rapid immune response to Hib. The subjects in the PR5I group of Protocol 
006 received PRP-OMPC for 3 infant doses as contained in PR5I, and a Toddler dose of PRP-T (Tetanus Toxoid 
conjugate) as contained in PENTACEL. Based on known kinetics of antibody responses to stand-alone 
PRP-OMPC Hib vaccines (as contained in PR5I) and combination PRP-T Hib vaccines (as contained in 
INFANRIX hexa and PENTACEL), higher PRP seroprotection rates and GMT are expected after the initial doses 
for PRP-OMPC Hib vaccines but higher post-Toddler dose GMT are expected for PRP-T Hib vaccines.  
The Hib literature shows that “mixed regimens” in which initial doses of PRP-OMPC are followed by other 
types of Hib conjugate vaccines (including PRP-T), resulted in the highest post-vaccination GMT.  
The response to the primary series is consistent with the anti-PRP GMT results of P007. However, the 
response to the booster dose is higher in study 006 than in study 007. In study 007, both primary series and 
booster used PR5I and the responses to the booster dose were lower than with the comparator (Infanrix 
Hexa). This reinforces the interest to boost with a vaccine containing another Hib component. 
The study’s outline and conduct were adequate to show consistency of the three batches of PR5I.  
Comparative immunogenicity (seroprotection/seroconversion) of three batches investigated show no 
significant differences and equivalence between the different PR5I batches was concluded for all valences.  
The primary and secondary immunogenicity findings demonstrated lot consistency and support the 
administration of PR5I as a 3-dose infant series given to healthy infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age . PR5I 
induced an immune response against all disease antigens. However, one of the two non-inferiority criteria 
with a control vaccine were not met for two pertussis antigens (one endpoint each): GMT response to 3-dose 
primary series for FHA and GMT response to a toddler dose of Pentacel for PRN. 
The immunogenicity data also support the administration of PR5I with licensed pediatric vaccines, including 
PCV 13 (Prevenar 13).  
Furthermore, the immunogenicity findings demonstrate that a 3-dose infant series of PR5I can be followed by 
a Toddler dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine to complete the 4-dose pertussis vaccination series. 
Study PRI01C 
PRI01C was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PR5I administered at 2, 3, and 
4 months of age when given concomitantly with licensed meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccines 
(NeisVac-C or Menjugate). (UK Vaccination schedule) 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 103/140 
A number of meningococcal vaccines are either available or are in development but in Europe only 
monovalent meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccines are licensed for infants, either as a 
tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugated vaccine (MCC-TT) or as a CRM197 conjugated vaccine (MCC-CRM).  
At the time of the study implementation, in the UK, the childhood vaccination schedule was an accelerated 
3-dose primary series of a pentavalent (DTaP-IPV-PRP) vaccine at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, the second and 
third doses being given concomitantly with a MCC vaccine, with a booster dose of a combined Hib-MCC 
vaccine at 12 months of age. A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (a CRM197 conjugated vaccine) is also 
administered at 2 and 4 months of age with a booster dose at 12 months of age. This unique and specific 
primary vaccination schedule used in the UK (not in other EU countries) was not covered by the initial PR5I 
Phase III clinical program.  
The introduction of universal hepatitis B vaccination of infants in the UK would only be considered with a 
multivalent combination vaccine. At the time of study implementation, DT5aP-based combinations were 
currently recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.  
Interference has been previously observed between MCC vaccines (TT or CRM197 conjugate) and 
Hib-containing paediatric vaccine (e.g. Pediacel® [PRP-TT conjugate]). Therefore to facilitate the potential 
future introduction of PR5I in the UK, its administration within the current childhood vaccination schedule and 
in particular when given concomitantly with MCC vaccines was to be evaluated. 
In addition, the immune responses following a booster dose with a Hib-MCC vaccine (TT conjugate, 
Menitorix®) given at 12 months of age was also required to confirm that adequate protection against these 
2 diseases was still observed about 8 months after the concomitant administration with PR5I. Since the study 
implementation, the UK vaccination calendar was changed on 01-JUN- 2013.  
Indeed 1 dose of MCC is now recommended at 3 months of age, still followed by a booster dose of a combined 
Hib-MCC vaccine at 11-12 months of age. Because this study includes evaluation of MCC antibody response 
1 month after the first dose of MCC administered at 3 months of age, it still remains relevant for the new 
British schedule. 
• 
Study Design 
This was an open-label, randomized Phase III study conducted in healthy infants (46 to 74 days of age at 
enrollment) at 11 study centers across the UK. Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
PR5I at 2 months of age and concomitantly with either NeisVac-C or Menjugate at 3 and 4 months of age. 
Additionally, subjects in both groups received the same other concomitant vaccines: Prevenar 13 at 2 and 4 
months of age and Menitorix (Haemophilus type b and Meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine), Prevenar 
13 and MMRVAXPRO at 12 months of age as part of the study.   
The vaccination period lasted 10 months and was split in 2 parts: Part I and Part II.  
Part I referred to the infant doses.  
Part II referred to the booster/Toddler dose.    
• 
Results 
Results based on the Part II FAS were comparable for Hib but not for MCC results. Seroresponse and GMT to 
MCC were much higher pre-booster (12 months) in the MCC-TT group compared to the MCC-CRM group, 
suggesting a more rapid waning after the primary doses in the MCC-CRM group (40.4% ≥1:8 at 12 months).

This may have a clinical impact as it is an age with the highest incidence of meningococcal invasive disease. 
GMTs were higher in the MCC-TT than in the MCC-CRM group at 13 months of age after the booster dose as 
they were post-dose 1 and post-dose 2.  
The present immunogenicity and safety findings support the administration of PR5I as a 3-dose primary 
series given to healthy infants at 2, 3, and 4 months of age concomitantly with MCC vaccine. The present 
findings also demonstrate that a 3-dose infant series of PR5I can be followed by a toddler dose of a combined 
Hib-MCC vaccine. 
In healthy infants who received a accelerated 3-dose primary series at 2, 3, and 4 months of age with PR5I, 
the second and third doses given concomitantly with a MCC vaccine followed by a booster dose with a 
combined Hib-MCC vaccine at 12 months of age together with routine PCV-13 and MMR vaccinations, the 
following conclusions can be drawn:  
• 
Post primary series, the post-Dose 2 SPR against MCC was acceptable for both the MCC-TT and 
MCC-CRM vaccines. Whatever the MCC vaccine used, the SPRs against MCC were high (titres ≥1:8 
dil) after 2 doses (≥99.1%) but also after 1 dose (≥96.4%); SPRs were also high (≥97.3%) and 
comparable after the booster dose. However, post-dose 1 and post-dose 2 GMTs were higher in the 
MCC-TT than in the MCC-CRM group.; these differences persisted at 12 months of age before the 
booster dose, and  a much lower seroresponse (titres ≥1:8) was observed in the MCC-CRM group 
(40.4% vs. 83.1% in the MCC-TT group), suggesting a more rapid waning after the primary series.  
The differences in GMT also persisted at 13 months of age after the booster dose.  
• 
PR5I induced a robust immune response against all disease antigens. Post-primary series, the SPR 
against Hib response was acceptable for the combined vaccine groups. The immune response was 
comparable to the responses observed in the pivotal controlled study 007 which compared the 
accelerated 3-dose primary series with PR5I to a licensed control vaccine. 
Study PRI02C 
The study report of Study PRI02C, ongoing at the time of the MAA submission, was submitted with the 
Responses to the D120 List of Questions. 
PRI02C was an open-label, single arm, multi-centre study designed to assess the immunogenicity and the 
safety of a mixed vaccination schedule that includes PR5I at 2 and 6 months of age and Pediacel at 4 months 
of age in Spain.  
Subjects received a 3-dose primary series with PR5I at 2 and 6 months of age and Pediacel at 4 months of age 
(mixed schedule), the first and second doses given concomitantly with one dose of meningococcal serogroup 
C TT-conjugate (MCC-TT) (NeisVac-C), together with one dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate 
vaccine (Prevenar 13) and one dose of pentavalent combination live vaccine of five human-bovine 
reassortant rotavirus strains (RotaTeq), and the third dose with RotaTeq. The vaccination period lasted 
around 4 months. 
Co-primary objectives 
- 
To demonstrate that the mixed schedule induces acceptable responses for hepatitis B (% of subjects 
with an anti-HBs titre ≥10 mIU/mL) one month after the third dose of the mixed schedule (i.e. at 
Month 7). 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

- 
To demonstrate that the mixed schedule induces acceptable responses for Haemophilus influenzae 
type b (Hib) (% of subjects with an anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate [PRP] titre ≥0.15 μg/mL) one 
month after the third dose of the mixed schedule (i.e. at Month 7). 
Secondary Objectives 
Immunogenicity 
• 
To describe the antibody response to all PR5I antigens: hepatitis B, Hib (PRP), diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids, pertussis (5aP: pertussis toxoid [PT], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], pertactin [PRN] and 
fimbriae [FIM] types 2&3) and inactivated poliovirus (IPV1, IPV2, IPV3) antigens one month after 
completion of the mixed schedule (i.e. at Month 7). 
• 
To describe the antibody response to meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccine one 
month after the second dose of MCC vaccine when used concomitantly with the mixed schedule. 
Safety 
• 
To describe the safety profile after each dose and any dose of study vaccines administered. 
The acceptability was demonstrated if the two-sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) around the 
post-vaccination response rate excluded rates equal to or lower than 90% for hepatitis B and 80% for Hib. 
The success of the study required that both co-primary objectives were achieved (i.e. for hepatitis B and for 
Hib). 
No formal hypotheses were to be tested, neither for the secondary immunogenicity objectives, nor for the 
secondary safety objectives.

Results  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The analysis of acceptability of HBs and Hib (PRP) antigen responses (i.e. proportion of subjects with an 
anti-HBs titre ≥10 mIU/mL and with an anti-PRP titre ≥0.15 mcg/mL, respectively) one month post-dose 3 
of the mixed schedule based on the PR5I PPS is provided in Table 41. 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the response rate for HBs and Hib (PRP), one month after the third 
dose of the mixed schedule, were respectively 97.2% and 99.0%, i.e. greater than the pre-specified 
acceptability thresholds (respectively 90% and 80%).

Descriptive statistics for Post-Dose 2 Immunogenicity of MCC Given at 2 and 4 Months of Age 
One month after the second dose of MCC vaccine administered at 2 and 4 months of age, the response rate 
(i.e. the proportion of subjects with an anti MCC titre ≥1:8 dil) was 99.2%. The anti-MCC GMT was 739.63 dil. 
The results based on the FAS were consistent with those of the MCC PPS.

In another study that applied concomitant vaccination with a MenC-TT vaccine, Study PRI01C, an 
acceptability threshold of 90% for the lower bound limit of the 95% confidence interval was prespecified. 
Although no formal hypotheses were tested for the secondary immunogenicity objectives, the lower bound of

the 2-sided 95% CI of the SPR to MCC one month after 2 doses of MCC vaccine (95.0%) was greater than 
90% (i.e. the prespecified acceptability threshold), demonstrating that the SPR for MCC vaccine was 
acceptable.

PRI01C in the UK 
 
Although no formal acceptability test was performed, the seroresponse rate for the MenC-TT vaccine 
(NeisVac-C) met the acceptability criteria set in another study, and is therefore considered acceptable. 
Differences were observed in GMT values observed after 2 doses of NeisVac-C (MenC-TT) with higher value 
in PRI01C study in the UK (2024.7 (dil)) compared to PRI02C study (739.63 (dil)) in Spain. For both studies, 
the proportion of subjects with an anti-MCC titre (SBA titre) ≥1:8 dil (i.e. seroprotection rate) was similar and 
above 99%. Concomitant use of other pediatric vaccines in Spain, such as PCV13 and rotavirus vaccine, could 
have contributed to the lower GMTs observed in Spain. These findings are consistent with those reported in 
the literature for concomitant administration of MCC-TT with TT-containing combination vaccines. 
Additional analysis on pertussis antigens  
In order to further support the immunological data package of PR5I, the Applicant was requested to provide 
i) a post-hoc efficacy bridging of PR5I immunogenicity data for all antigens to Daptacel immunogenicity data 
obtained from the Sweden I Efficacy trial: PR5I immunogenicity data in a 3-dose schedule (2, 4, 6) in studies 
005 and 006 compared to Daptacel immunogenicity data in a 3-dose schedule (2, 4, 6) in the Sweden I 
Efficacy trial (of note, this was not a retesting exercise but a comparison with historical data); ii) post-hoc 
non-inferiority testing results of studies 005, 006, 007 and 008 for all antigens post-primary and 
post-booster; iii) an efficacy bridging of PR5I immunogenicity data in a 2-dose schedule (2-4) in study 008 to 
the immunogenicity data of a similar vaccine for which clinical efficacy in a 2-dose schedule is established 
(Sweden II trial).   
i) The Sweden I Efficacy trial was a 4-arm, randomized, double-blind, controlled study, conducted in 14 
study centers in Sweden and compared the following vaccines: DT (Swedish standard of care), CLI DTP 
(whole cell pertussis), DTaP2 and DTaP5 (Daptacel), administered to infants at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. The 
Sweden I immunogenicity results included in the post-hoc analyses below focus on those obtained for 
Daptacel, given the similarity in vaccine formulation with the DTaP5 portion of PR5I for diphtheria, tetanus 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

Page 110/140 
and pertussis antigens but for lower PT and FHA antigen content in Daptacel (10 and 5 mcg/dose, resp.). This 
study was conducted by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control. 
The Sweden I trial demonstrated that the absolute efficacy of Daptacel compared to the DT control was 85% 
(95% CI: 81; 89) in relation to the WHO Case Definition for infants (typical pertussis defined as ≥21 
consecutive days of paroxysmal cough and laboratory or culture-confirmed B. pertussis) who received 3 
doses of vaccine.  For mild disease (defined as ≥1 day of paroxysmal cough and laboratory confirmed 
pertussis), the VE for Daptacel was 78% (95% CI: 73; 83). 
A post-hoc, descriptive comparison analysis of GMTs and Vaccine response rates (as defined in the Phase III 
PR5I studies) for PR5I pertussis antigen responses in P005 and Daptacel responses in Sweden I are shown in 
Table 47. 
Table 47. Post-hoc non-inferiority comparisons for pertussis antigens postdose 3 (P005 PR5I vs. Daptacel in 
Sweden I) 
 
The analysis shows that the PR5I pertussis responses in P005 had slightly higher vaccine response rates for 
PT (rate difference 95% CI included 0, difference not significant), marginally lower vaccine response rates for 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 111/140 
FHA, significantly lower response rates for PRN, and lower vaccine response rates for FIM, as compared to 
Daptacel Sweden I responses. However vaccine response rates FIM were in excess of 90% for PR5I. The PR5I 
GMTs were over 2-fold higher for PT, 1.4-fold higher for FHA, 0.48-fold for PRN, and 0.67-fold for FIM, as 
compared to Daptacel Sweden I GMTs. 
The P006 results are similar to those in P005. 
Additionally, the Applicant provided data on the anti-pertussis GMTs observed in a pivotal European Pediacel 
trial (A5I16), utilizing a 3-dose priming schedule administered to study participants at 2, 3 and 4 months of 
age. 
To further demonstrate efficacy, the comparability of pertussis efficacy observed in Sweden I and that 
inferred from the immunogenicity studies of a pentavalent DTaP5-IPV-Hib vaccine (Pediacel) was calculated 
using the correlates of protection model developed by Storsaeter et al. and applied by Kohberger et al. in 
order to bridge immunogenicity to protection of pertussis disease. The estimated vaccine efficacy of Pediacel 
following primary series in study A5I16 was 83.0% (95% CI: 70.0; 94.8). The overall estimated vaccine 
efficacy of Pediacel, following primary series (2 or 3 doses of the vaccine administered in infancy, using 2/3/4, 
2/4/6 or 3/5 schedule) was between 79.6% and 83.2%. 
In summary, the overall post-primary series pertussis immunogenicity data for PR5I in studies P005 and 
P006, following a 3-dose schedule in infants, show comparable PT response rates but lower FHA, PRN and FIM 
response rates to those observed in Sweden I and in Pediacel pivotal trials.  
ii) Non-inferiority testing results of studies 005, 006, 007 and 008 for all antigens post-primary 
and post-booster. The Applicant provided immunogenicity non-inferiority analyses for all antigens 
post-primary as well as a visual presentation thereof. The post-booster comparisons of all antigens were 
presented for study 008 (2-dose) and limited to the pertussis antigens for the other studies. 
Some of these analyses were performed as primary or secondary endpoint in the pivotal US and EU trials, 
whereas other analyses (pertussis post-primary, GMT comparisons, comparisons of all antigens post-primary 
to Infanrix hexa in the 2-dose schedule) were performed post-hoc and should therefore be interpreted with 
caution. In summary, it was noted that the pertussis data were similar across studies and vaccination 
schedules (2-dose, 3-dose). In general, PT GMTs are superior and PT response rates are similar to control, 
whereas FHA and PRN GMTs and response rates are weaker or inferior to control. 
Although the exact contribution of the individual pertussis antigens to protection is not well understood, PT is 
considered to play a key role in establishing protection against clinical pertussis. The PT data are therefore 
reassuring. Nevertheless, the immune responses against all pertussis antigens of PR5I do not indicate that 
PR5I would be superior to the current vaccines. A similar vaccine efficacy is anticipated based on the PT data, 
but a lesser vaccine efficacy cannot be excluded based on the weaker or inferior FHA and PRN data. 
iii) Efficacy bridging of PR5I immunogenicity data in a 2-dose schedule (2-4) in study 008 to the 
immunogenicity data of a similar vaccine for which clinical efficacy in a 2-dose schedule is 
established (Sweden II trial). Study 008 (2 doses) demonstrated lower immune responses to most 
antigens compared to study 007 (3 doses). Therefore a post-hoc analysis to assess non-inferiority of immune 
responses for PR5I antigens vs. Infanrix hexa after primary vaccination (post-dose 2) was requested during 
the procedure, using the same non-inferiority margins as used for the post-toddler dose analysis. 
Non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for FHA/PRN/IPV1 antigens and IPV3 was nearly inferior.  
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

Page 112/140 
To further investigate this, the Applicant was requested to explore an efficacy bridging of PR5I 
immunogenicity data in a 2-dose schedule (2-4) in study 008 to the immunogenicity data of a similar vaccine 
for which clinical efficacy in a 2-dose schedule is established (Sweden II trial).  
Sweden II was a 4-arm, randomized, double-blind, controlled study, conducted in 24 study centers in 
Sweden, which compared the relative efficacy and immunogenicity of the following DTP vaccines: a whole cell 
pertussis formulation (DTPwc, Wellcome), a 2-component acellular pertussis formulation (DTaP2, SKB), a 
3-component acellular pertussis formulation (DTaP3, Chiron) and a 5-component acellular pertussis 
formulation (HCPDT, Sanofi Pasteur). These vaccines were administered to infants at either 2, 4 and 6 
months of age or at 3, 5 and 12 months of age. The study was conducted by the Swedish Institute for 
Infectious Disease Control. 
The Sweden II trial demonstrated that the relative protective efficacies (using the 3, 5 and 12 month 
schedule) against culture-confirmed pertussis, irrespective of duration, for HCPDT was high (Relative Risk 
(RR) = 0.85, 95%CI: 0.41; 1.79) and similar compared to DTPwc. Responses to the PRN and FHA antigens 
were lower (between 80 and 90%) than those demonstrated with HCPDT (>95%). Responses to the PT and 
FIM antigens were similar to those demonstrated with HCPDT, with PT response >95% for both vaccines. 
Additional analysis on Hib antigen 
After the primary series, PR5I was superior to control (Infanrix hexa, Pentacel/Recombivax HB) in terms of 
response rates against the Hib antigen. Because the PRP antigen is conjugated to the strongly immunogenic 
OMPC conjugate in PR5I, but conjugated to the lesser immunogenic TT in the control vaccines, a superior 
priming response with PR5I is reasonable.  
However, this primary superiority was not reproduced after the booster dose. In contrast, in both study 007 
and 008 the comparison test favored Infanrix hexa although non-inferiority is formally demonstrated. The 
Applicant argued that, considering that 90-95% of PR5I vaccinees (study 007 and 008) achieved a titre of > 
1.0 μg/ml, indicative of long-term protection, after the toddler dose and the high vaccination coverage in 
Europe, the somewhat lower post-toddler dose anti-Hib titres induced by PR5I are not likely to negatively 
affect Hib disease burden in Europe. The applicant’s response was considered acceptable.  
The vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the hexavalent vaccines (Hexavac and Infanrix hexa) against invasive Hib 
disease was monitored in Germany during 5 years in the period 2001-2005 (Kalies et al., 2008). For children 
having an incomplete primary series, the VE was 68.4% (95% CI: 19.0 to 87.6), but when receiving a second 
year dose while not being fully immunised, VE was 100.0% (95% CI: 0.0 to 100.0). These data are 
encouraging since they indicate that, with the current vaccines, the booster dose provides optimal protection 
even if less than 3 priming doses were given (second year dose, but not fully immunised), which reflects in 
part the real life setting and/or a 2-dose priming schedule.

Germany’s experience after 5 years of licensure. Vaccine. 2008, 26:2545-52. 
OMPC-conjugated Hib-antigens have been used before in the US as a stand-alone vaccine, but PR5I is the 
first hexavalent, fully liquid vaccine that contains the PRP-OMPC Hib-antigen. The pharmacodynamics of this 
newly combined vaccine in terms of long-term Hib protection are therefore difficult to estimate based on 
vaccine effectiveness of current PRP-TT combination vaccines. 
PR5I is non-inferior compared to the control vaccines in terms of post-booster Hib responses indicative of 
long-term protection (anti-PRP ≥ 1.0 μg/mL) but the response rates in the 2-dose and 3-dose schedule are 
slightly lower (90-95%) which is somehow unexpected in view of the strong OMPC-conjugate in PR5I.  
It is anticipated that the impact on clinical protection will be nihil or minimal. 
The CHMP therefore agrees that monitoring of vaccine failure reports through routine postmarketing 
surveillance is anticipated to be sufficient to alleviate concerns regarding duration of protection of the Hib 
antigen in Vaxelis. 
In addition, the protective efficacy of PR5I in the prevention of invasive Hib diseases is expected to be similar 
to that obtained with a monovalent PRP-OMPC vaccine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study involving 3486 Native American (Navajo) infants (the Protective Efficacy Trial). Following the primary 
2-dose regimen, the protective efficacy was 93% (95% confidence interval [C.I.] 57-98%). In this study, 
91% and 59% of vaccinated subjects developed anti-PRP antibody >0.15 µg/mL and >1.0 µg/mL, 
respectively. Efficacy for the follow-up period of two years and nine months following the last dose, was 
96.6% (95% C.I., 72.2-99.9%) in children under 18 months of age and 100% (95% C.I., 23.5-100) in 
children over 18 months of age. In a phase III study conducted in Europe with Vaxelis given as a 2-dose 
primary series at 2 and 4 months of age, a high proportion of Vaxelis recipients developed early 
seroprotective anti-Hib responses (97% and 73% subjects developed anti-PRP antibody ≥0.15 µg/mL and ≥
1.0 µg/mL, respectively). 
Additional data on of Hepatitis B Antigen 
Data on protective efficacy of the hepatitis B component of PR5I is available in neonates born of mothers 
positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg (a core-associated antigenic complex which correlates with high 
infectivity). The estimated efficacy in prevention of chronic hepatitis B infection was 95% as compared to the 
infection rate in unvaccinated historical controls.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two main studies that compared PR5I with Infanrix hexa were submitted in the application: 
• 
Study 007 (BE, FI, DE): safety and immunogenicity in a 3-dose primary schedule followed by a 
booster dose in the second year of life: 2,3,4+12 Month [3+1], concomitant RV5, PCV13, MMRV; 
• 
Study 008 (FI, IT, SE): safety and immunogenicity study in 2-dose primary schedule followed by a 
booster dose in the second year of life: 2,4+12 Month [2+1], concomitant RV2 or RV5, PCV13; 
In addition, four supportive studies were provided. Two US pivotal studies compared PR5I to the US standard 
of care, Pentacel and RecombivaxHB. 
• 
005 (US pivotal): 2,4,6+15 Month [3+1], concomitant RV5 and PCV13;  
• 
006 (US pivotal): 2,4,6+15 Month [3+1], concomitant RV5 and PCV13;  
• 
PRI01C (UK): 2,3,4+12 Month [3+1], concomitant MenC-TT or MenC-CRM, PCV13, MMR; 
• 
PRI02C (ES): 2,4,6 Months [3+0], mixed hexavalent-pentavalent-hexavalent schedule with PR5I at 
2 and 6 Months and Pediacel at 4 Months of age, concomitant MenC-TT, PCV13, RV5. 
Overall the clinical studies were adequately conducted and were based on demonstrating acceptability or 
non-inferiority of the immune responses after either primary and booster vaccination or both.  
For pertussis, acceptability and non-inferiority endpoints for these antigens were evaluated after the 
12-month dose in the EU pivotal studies, because it was considered that the vaccination series for pertussis 
is not complete until after the toddler dose. However immunogenicity after the primary series should be 
collected as of relevance. Indeed non-inferiority comparisons after the priming doses were determined 
post-hoc. 
The EU pivotal studies compare PR5I with Infanrix hexa in a 3+1 and 2+1 vaccination schedule, including 
concomitant administration of PCV13 and rotavirus vaccine RV5 or RV2.  
Different thresholds are used in different studies to define seroprotection rates for PRP, diphtheria and 
tetanus, due to different regulatory requirements in the US and the EU. 
Of note, PCV13 (Prevenar 13) was coadministered with PR5I in the EU pivotal studies, hence all 
immunogenicity data take into account the coadministration, even if there is no formal study to formally 
assess the extent of the potential impact of PCV on PR5I immunogenicity. The only study including a control 
arm without the concomitant administration with PCV (Prevenar), study 004, did not perform a formal 
comparison of groups and thus could not conclude on the potential interference between administration of 
PCV7 and PR5I, however descriptive results were indicative of no interference (see further below). 
Concomitant administration with other PCV vaccines such as PCV10 (Synflorix) was not studied, although 
these data would be useful in view of PCV10 being implemented in several national immunisation programme 
across Europe. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
PR5I elicits acceptable immune responses to all antigens as demonstrated by the EU pivotal studies, with the 
exception of FHA pertussis antigen post-primary series:

non-inferiority of all PR5I response compared to Infanrix hexa (Study 008) 
Seroresponse to the Hib PRP-OMPC antigen is superior to both controls used, Pentacel/Recombivax and 
Infanrix hexa, after the primary series but similar or slightly lower after the booster dose. 
Nevertheless, seroresponse to the pertussis FHA and PRN antigens was systematically weaker in both EU and 
US pivotal studies as demonstrated by: 
• 
GMT non-inferiority compared to Pentacel/Recombivax HB not met for FHA GMTs post-primary series 
(primary endpoint: Study 005, secondary endpoint: 006) 
• 
GMT non-inferiority compared to Pentacel/Recombivax HB not met for PRN GMTs post-booster 
(secondary endpoint: 006) 
• 
lower FHA and PRN seroresponses compared to Infanrix hexa (95% CI not overlapping) post-primary 
series (tertiary analysis) (Study 007)  
• 
lower seroresponse compared to Pentacel post-primary series (no formal comparison made but 14% 
difference in seroresponse rate to FHA compared to the concomitant Prevenar-PR5I group) (Study 
006) 
• 
In most studies comparing PR5I versus comparator, GMTs of FHA and PRN were considerably lower. 
In the 2+1 dose schedule (2,4+12) and the 3+1 dose schedule (2,3,4+12) the titres reached about 
half the value of the titres reached with Infanrix hexa for all time points, and lower seroresponse rates 
with non-overlapping 95%CI were observed after the primary series. In the 2+1 dose schedule 
(2,4+12), the immunogenicity non-inferiority could not be demonstrated in a post-hoc analysis for 
pertussis antigens FHA and PRN and polio antigen IPV1, in addition to a low IPV3 response one month 
after the 2 doses (hence in 5 months infants), compared to Infanrix hexa. Although the clinical 
relevance of these data remain uncertain in the absence of a correlate of protection, complementing 
the primary vaccination scheme with a booster dose in the second year of life is important. 
Concerning a potential role of the concomitant administration of PCV in these lower responses, Study 004 
overall supports the co-administration of Prevenar with PR5I since pre-specified immunogenicity criteria were 
met. In addition the hepatitis B component elicited acceptable anti hepatitis B immune responses.  
Additional analysis on pertussis antigens 
i) Post-hoc non-inferiority comparisons were made between PR5I immunogenicity data of studies 005 and 
006 and Daptacel immunogenicity data obtained in the Sweden I Efficacy trial, in which 85% vaccine efficacy 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 116/140 
of Daptacel was demonstrated. These exploratory analyses show that PR5I is similar to Daptacel in terms of 
PT response, but weaker or inferior in terms of FHA, PRN and FIM response. In the absence of pre-specified 
efficacy bridging criteria and an established correlate for protection, it is impossible to conclude on PR5I 
vaccine efficacy based on these data. The similar PT response is encouraging in terms of protection against 
pertussis, although the exact contribution of the individual pertussis antigens to protection is not well 
understood. 
Post-hoc efficacy bridging analyses are to be interpreted with caution due to different vaccines compositions, 
smaller sample sizes, different regions with different epidemiology, different timing, type of data comparison 
(i.e. with historical data, no retesting done) and since bridging criteria were not prespecified. These analyses 
can therefore only be exploratory as to the clinical significance of the observed immunogenicity of PR5I.  
The Applicant also provided GMT data of Pediacel from the A5I16 pivotal trial. Vaccine efficacy of Pediacel has 
been estimated earlier through modelling at 83% in study A5I16 and between 79.6 - 83.2% when using 
various primary series (using the Storsaeter model). The GMT data are difficult to interpret because no formal 
statistical comparison parameter is calculated. A visual interpretation shows similar post-dose 3 GMTs for PT 
(overlapping 95% CI) and higher post-dose 3 GMTs for FHA, PRN and FIM (not overlapping 95% CI) for PR5I 
compared to Pediacel. 
ii) Concerning the post-hoc non-inferiority analysis across trials, it was seen in general that PT GMTs are 
higher and PT response rates are similar to control, whereas FHA and PRN GMTs and response rates are 
weaker than control. Although the exact contribution of the individual pertussis antigens to protection is not 
well understood, PT is considered to play a key role in establishing protection against clinical pertussis. The PT 
data are therefore reassuring. Nevertheless, the immune responses against all pertussis antigens of PR5I do 
not indicate that PR5I would be superior to the current vaccines. A similar vaccine efficacy is anticipated 
based on the PT data, but a lesser vaccine efficacy cannot be excluded based on the weaker FHA and PRN 
data. 
iii) The Applicant was requested to explore an efficacy bridging of PR5I immunogenicity data in a 2-dose 
schedule (2-4) in study 008 to the immunogenicity data of a similar vaccine for which clinical efficacy in a 
2-dose schedule is established (Sweden II trial). The post-hoc efficacy bridging with the HCPDT vaccine in the 
Sweden II study confirms earlier results of the original data package in that adequate PT response but inferior 
PRN and FHA response after only 2 priming doses are observed. However this data should be interpreted with 
cautions due to the limitations of the analysis. Overall, as mentioned, there are some uncertainties with the 
2-dose schedule –whose clinical relevance is unknown- which will be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC, but 
the dose recommendation should not be impacted. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PR5I includes 5 acellular pertussis components: PT, FHA, PRN, FIM2 and FIM3. These are all included in 
Pentacel as part of the standard of care in the US, and in Daptacel and Pediacel. 
The primary endpoints were met in all studies; in particular regarding PT and FIM similar response rates and 
higher GMTs were observed both post-primary and post-booster in comparison to control vaccines containing 
these antigens. Lower FHA, PRN, IPV1 and IPV3 immune responses were observed after a 2-dose primary 
schedule (2-4 months), and lower FHA and PRN immune responses were observed after a 3-dose primary 
schedule. Pertussis response rates are similar to the control vaccine for all pertussis antigens after the 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

Page 117/140 
booster dose, but FHA GMT remain lower regardless of the primary schedule. Although the clinical relevance 
of these data remain uncertain, complementing the primary vaccination scheme with a booster dose in the 
second year of life as recommended seems necessary. The clinical implications of this finding might be further 
elucidated by monitoring of vaccine failure through routine surveillance, also in light of the increasing 
incidence of pertussis disease worldwide, in particular among young infants. 
PR5I is the first hexavalent vaccine that contains the Hib PRP antigen conjugated to OMPC in a fully liquid 
formulation. This antigen demonstrates higher immune response rates after the primary series than the 
tetanus toxoid conjugated PRP antigen, but comparable or lower response rates after the booster dose. 
Overall the efficacy of the vaccine is demonstrated in the proposed indication in infants and toddlers above 
the age of 6 weeks (see also section 2.10 on the discussion related to the indication). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety data across the 2 Phase III randomized, comparator-controlled, blinded clinical EU-based studies 
(Protocols 007 and 008) as well as across Protocols 004, 005, 006, 007, 008 and PRI01C were pooled in order 
to perform a comprehensive analysis of the safety of PR5I in a large population. 
In total, 16,226 doses were administered to infants and toddlers. 
Adverse events 
All adverse events 
The 2 vaccination groups were similar with respect to the safety parameters measured.

Solicited injection-site Adverse events 
There were statistically significant differences observed in the percent of subjects with injection-site 
erythema and injection-site swelling in the PR5I group as compared to the Control group (table 49). 
For severe injection site erythema (>5.0 cm), severe injection site pain, and severe injection site swelling 
(>5.0 cm) the analysis shows that for injection-site erythema and swelling >5 cm, the incidence was 
numerically higher for subjects receiving PR5I as compared to Control. The difference was not statistically 
significant for severe injection-site swelling (95% CI includes 0), and it was marginally significant for severe 
injection-site erythema (95% CI 0.2 to 3.3). The overall incidence of severe injection-site erythema and 
swelling >5 cm was low (<5%), and of brief duration, similar between PR5I and Control. These are expected 
reactions with either similar or marginally higher incidence between PR5I and Control.

For studies 007 and 008 combined, the Applicant provided the proportion of subjects and their 95%

The analysis shows that for injection-site erythema and swelling >5 cm, the incidence was numerically higher 
for subjects receiving PR5I as compared to Control. The difference was not statistically significant for 
injection-site swelling (95% CI includes 0), and it was marginally significant for injection-site erythema (95% 
CI 0.2 to 3.3). The overall incidence of injection-site erythema and swelling >5 cm was low (<5%), and of 
brief duration, similar between PR5I and Control. As these are expected reactions with either similar or 
marginally higher incidence between PR5I and Control, the clinical significance of the analysis is low. 
Based on these further statistical analysis for severe injection site erythema (>5.0 cm), severe injection site 
pain, and severe injection site swelling (>5.0 cm), it can be concluded that these expected reactions occur 
with similar or marginally higher incidence between PR5I and Control. 
Unsolicited injection-site adverse events 
No statistically significant differences were observed with these unsolicited injection-site adverse events 
between the two vaccination groups.

Similar results were observed across Protocols 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, and PRI01C, with the exception of 
pyrexia which was reported in 56.8% of the subjects in the PR5I group and 47.4% of the subjects in the 
Control group [estimated difference: 9.4% (95% CI: 6.7, 12.0)]. Most events of pyrexia were mild to 
moderate in intensity and of short duration (2 days or less) with a low percentage (2.1% and 2.5% of PR5I 
and Control group, respectively) being reported severe in intensity (temperature ≥39.5°C). The increased 
rate of pyrexia as compared to control in the PR5I recipients across the Phase IIb and Phase III studies was 
driven mainly by the higher incidence of pyrexia observed in the U.S. studies (Protocols 005 and 006) as 
compared to PENTACEL.  
Solicited temperature elevation 
If the elevated temperature was part of an intercurrent illness, then it was not captured as an adverse event 
of pyrexia; therefore, the rates of elevated temperature are slightly higher as compared to pyrexia. The 
severity rating scale for elevated temperature was the same as for pyrexia (mild: temperatures between 
≥38°C to ≤38.4°, moderate: ≥38.5°C to ≤39.4°C, and severe: ≥39.5°C).

Table 52. Analysis Analysis of subjects with temperature by severity Day 1 to Day 5 following any dose 
vaccination (All subjects as treated population) (Protocols 007 and d008) 
 
Across Protocols 004, 005, 006, 007, and 008, a statistically significant higher proportion of subjects in the 
PR5I group (61.2%) as compared to the Control group (52.7%) reported fever (defined as temperature 
≥38.0°C, rectal) based on daily temperature measurements Day 1 to 5 post-vaccination. The statistically 
significant difference appears to be driven by the U.S. studies (Protocols 005 and 006) where the difference 
in fever rate between PR5I and Control was greater than in the EU studies. The comparator used in Protocols 
004, 005, and 006 was PENTACEL and the comparator used in the Protocol 007 and 008 was INFANRIX hexa. 
The overall rate of severe fever (temperature ≥39.5°C) was generally low in both vaccination groups (≤3% 
across the 5 studies combined), similar to the data in Protocols 007 and 008. 
Unsolicited systemic adverse events 
In studies 007 and 008, the most frequent unsolicited systemic adverse events reported were pyrexia (15.5% 
in the PR5I group and 14.2% in the INFANRIX hexa group), diarrhoea (13.8% in the PR5I group and 12.1% 
in the INFANRIX hexa group), and rhinitis (8.8% in the PR5I group and 10.0% in the INFANRIX hexa group). 
There were no statistically significant differences observed between the PR5I group and the INFANRIX hexa 
group for these events. 
Across Protocols 004, 005, 006, 007, 008 and PRI01C, 49.7% versus 53.2% of subjects respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited systemic adverse events in the PR5I group versus those in the Control 
group. While there were slightly higher rates of body temperature increased (0.7, 95% CI: 0.1, 1.2), 
diarrhoea (1.5, 95% CI: 0.1, 2.8), and decreased appetite (0.7, 95% CI: 0.1, 1.3), in the PR5I group 
compared to the Control group in the global safety population, these small differences are not considered to 
be clinically meaningful.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were collected at various time points across studies as the protocols were designed to collect all SAEs 
occurring to any subject from the time the consent was signed through the protocol-specific reporting period 
(e.g., Day 1 to 14 post-vaccination) and all SAEs that were either a death or considered by an investigator to 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 123/140 
be possibly, probably, or definitely vaccine related which occurred at any time during the study. The protocols 
did differ in the periods of time following vaccination during which all SAEs were collected (without regard to 
causality), with longer periods in US studies as per US guidance. However, the protocols for all of these 
studies provide clear instruction that the investigator was to assess and assign causality to each adverse 
event according to criteria defined in the protocol and report the causality in the clinical eCRF (electronic 
clinical report form). Therefore, for all of the protocols, SAEs occurring throughout the study were assessed 
for relatedness, and additional information collected if considered vaccine-related, regardless of timing in 
relation to vaccination. The CHMP found this approach acceptable. 
Vaccine related Serious adverse events 
Vaccine-related serious adverse events after any vaccination were reported in 4 subjects (0.3%) in the PR5I 
group and 4 subjects (0.3%) in the INFANRIX hexa group across Protocols 007 and 008 (table 53). Of the 4 
subjects who reported a vaccine-related serious adverse event in the PR5I group, only 3 events (i.e., febrile 
convulsion, prolymphocytic leukaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) were related to PR5I; 1 subject 
had gastroenteritis that was considered related to RotaTeq only.

Serious adverse events of pyrexia and febrile convulsions/convulsions 
In Protocols 007 and 008, there were a total of four reports of febrile convulsion or convulsion (two in each 
vaccination group) that were considered serious within Days 1 to 15; two of which were vaccine-related (one 
in each vaccination group). The subject in the PR5I group who experienced a vaccine-related febrile 
convulsion also had concurrent viral gastroenteritis and respiratory tract infection. The convulsion ended

A total of 160 subjects (111 (2.1%) in the PR5I group and 49 (2.1%) in the Control group) in Protocols 004, 
005, 006, 007, 008, and PRI01C were identified as “premature infants”.

Other factors 
No statistical hypothesis tests were performed on of race, ethnicity, gender, and premature birth. Although 
there were some numerical differences noted in race and ethnicity groups, there were no findings of clinical 
significance when the safety data were reviewed with regard to the aforementioned baseline characteristics. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interactions with drugs were investigated.  
Regarding concomitant vaccinations, the CHMP considered the need to include information to the SmPC about 
the much higher frequency of fever and severe fever (>39.5°C) in patients receiving PR5I and concomitant 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Phase III studies conducted with PR5I were not designed as a comparison 
of PR5I with or without the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Since all subjects received as part of the 
trial design pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, it is not possible based on the available clinical data to 
determine an increased frequency rate of pyrexia for PR5I when given concomitantly with pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine in comparison to PR5I given alone. However, observations made across studies indicate 
that PR51 in combination with Prevenar 13 (concomitant) for the toddler dose induces a higher rate of fever 
(pyrexia) than other combinations (PR5I + ProQuad). The uncertainties that follow comparison of results 
between different studies are acknowledged. Still, the rate of pyrexia after a dose of PR51 and Prevenar 13 
to toddlers is higher compared to study 007 where a combination of PR51 and ProQuad was used to toddlers 
and the studies 005/006 where other vaccines where used for toddlers (DAPTACEL, PENTACEL, Prevenar 13, 
ActHIB/PedvaxHIB).

While the rate of pyrexia is the same at 2 months infant dose and toddler dose in study 007, the toddler dose 
has much higher rate of fever compared to the 2 months infant dose in study 008. Also, in study 008 the total 
dosage regimen is 3 doses while it is 4 doses in study 007. Similar trend is seen for severe pyrexia. Therefore, 
data on fever rates across studies support the trend of substantially higher fever rates for the combination of 
PR51 and Prevenar 13 given to toddlers. This information was deemed important to be included in the SmPC 
section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8. 
The rates of all fever ≥38.0 and severe fever ≥39.5 for both infant and toddler doses were not available for 
vaccine-related pyrexia on a per-dose basis within the study database. Therefore, for the SmPC the CHMP 
agreed to utilize the objective temperature data which provides the requested information, but this is a

change in method compared to showing the rates of vaccine-related pyrexia. The rates of fever are very 
similar regardless of method. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the 9 out of 2525 subjects (0.4%) who discontinued due to an adverse event in Protocol 007 and 008 
combined, 8 were in the INFANRIX hexa group. The one subject in the PR5I group discontinued due to an 
unrelated serious adverse event (congenital heart disease). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Methods to collect safety data, including the Vaccine Report Card (VRC), are acceptable. The magnitude 
of the database is acceptable as per CHMP guideline on vaccine development 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05). No sub-population has been studied. In particular, specific safety issues are 
not ruled out for infants and toddlers with chronic pathologies. However, preterm infants were not excluded 
from the dataset at enrolment and more than 100 children have been enrolled. Although no safety issue has 
been identified in this group, the monitoring of those infants is desirable after the marketing of the vaccine.  
All subjects (n=7557) in the studies received concomitant routine vaccinations, therefore the systemic 
adverse events reported in the PR5I and control groups included those of the concomitant vaccines. PR5I is 
highly reactogenic and nearly all subjects reported some local and systemic reaction after a dose.  
A total of 85% of infants and toddlers receiving PR5I reported injection site reactions. The majority of 
reactions were mild or moderate and transient, and few continued after 1 week. Injection site pain was most 
frequent (71%). In the PR5I group, 6.8 % of subjects reported severe pain compared with 5.4% in the control 
groups. Injection site erythema and swelling were significantly more frequent in the PR5I group than the 
control with a difference in the range of 3-6%. 
Among the infant doses the first dose seems to give more injection site reactions, while the second dose gives 
the highest frequency of fever. The rate of solicited injection site reactions and fever are higher after the 
toddler dose than the infant doses.   
Solicited systemic adverse events were reported in 95% of subjects that received PR5I after any vaccine 
dose. Irritability was the most frequent systemic event (84%). 
The unfavourable effects observed in the clinical studies are comparable to those of the licensed comparators 
vaccines. PR5I has a slightly higher injection-site associated reactogenicity as compared to Infanrix hexa, but 
comparable incidences of elevated temperature (≥ 38.0 °C). Several occurrences of severe pyrexia (≥ 39.5 
°C) were nevertheless reported in the PR5I group. 
Overall, the safety profile of PR5I is similar to the comparator vaccines. Nevertheless, differences in the 
occurrence of safety events were observed in the following cases 
− 
Among solicited injection-site adverse events, erythema and swelling were more frequent in the PR5I 
group compared to the INFANRIX hexa groups (studies 007 and 008), essentially after the first dose 
of the vaccine; however based on further statistical analysis for severe injection site erythema (>5.0 
cm), severe injection site pain, and severe injection site swelling (>5.0 cm) it can be concluded that 
these expected reactions occur with similar or marginally higher incidence between PR5I and Control. 
Concerning fever, a higher overall rate of fever was observed in the EU study pool although antipyretic use did 
not appear to differ significantly between the study pools. Concerning possible explanations for the large

difference in absolute rate of fever in the EU and US studies, these include additional dosing and concomitant 
use of PR5I and MMRV.  
Systematic variation in adverse event score across studies performed in the EU vs. US was seen and possible 
explanations considered. Indeed despite consistent safety data collection practices across the Phase III 
program a slightly higher rate of non-serious, unsolicited systemic reactions was observed in the EU study 
pool as compared to the overall global study pool. The reason is unknown, but the difference is not considered 
to be clinically significant since the higher rates were noted for both PR5I and Control, and the events were 
not serious.  
It was also noted that estimates in proportions in analysis tables, e.g. concerning all crying and all pyrexia, 
were different than their corresponding observed proportions related to study vaccines or control because the 
estimates were adjusted by their study sample size weight.  
Only few serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported across the studies but several occurrence of 
serious pyrexia were reported in the PR5I group. Seven deaths were reported and all were considered to be 
unrelated to the vaccine. Two deaths in the PR5I group were attributed to sudden infant death syndrome. 
Considering the number of infants in the PR5I groups, this level of occurrence is not unexpected but 
unexpected deaths after vaccination should be monitored after the marketing of the vaccine. Particularly, the 
CHMP agreed to apply standard practices for routine pharmacovigilance activities for monitoring adverse 
events in infants born prematurely and with unexpected deaths notified shortly after vaccination.  
Bexsero is a vaccine against meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitides group B indicated for 
the same age group as PR5I. Bexsero contains outer membrane vesicles from Neisseria meningitides group 
B while PR5I contains PRP conjugated to an outer membrane complex also from Neisseria meningitides group 
B.  As both components have a potential to induce fever, the additional potential risk in the case the two 
vaccines are administered concomitantly was considered. The Applicant presented data on fever rates for 
another vaccine for infants that contain the same OMPC components as PR51. Compared to other similar 
vaccine products the OMPC component does not seem to induce more fever. The CHMP therefore agree that 
at this stage there is no reason to expect higher fever rates, if PR51 is given concomitantly with Bexsero, than 
what is described for each of the products. 
In study 008 where PR5I was administered concomitantly with Prevenar 13 (PCV13) as a booster dose of both 
vaccines, fever ≥38.0°C was reported in 54.3% of infants, compared to 33.1% to 40.7% of infants during 
the primary series. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 3.7% of children (post-booster) and 0.2% to 0.8% of 
children (post-primary) receiving PR5I with PCV13. Almost all fevers after primary and booster doses were 
mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient (duration of ≤2 days). This was reflected in sections 4.4, 4.5 and 
4.8. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of PR5I is similar to the comparator vaccines and is considered acceptable in the 
proposed indication. The most common ADRs for PR5I are decreased appetite, somnolence, vomiting, 
crying/irritability, fever and injections sites reactions (erythema, pain, swelling). These ADR have been 
included in the SmPC with a frequency of >1/10 (very common).  
No major safety concern has been identified.

There is no data above 15 months of age. The safety data generated from the clinical studies can however be 
supportive for the use of PR5I in toddlers greater than 15 months of age, e.g. in the catch-up scenario (see 
also Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects, further below).  
In the post-marketing period, further information will be generated by means of routine pharmacovigilance 
on the tolerability of the vaccine in infant population presenting chronic conditions, in pre-term infants and in 
infants who unexpectedly died after vaccination. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
During evaluation, the Applicant was asked to consider data obtained with similar vaccines 
(hexa-penta-quadrivalent) with a particular focus on the safety and age indication of the paediatric diphtheria 
dosage in children above the age of 2 years, for which a waiver was granted. The Applicant clarified that DTaP 
and DTaP-IPV vaccines, which contain quantities of diphtheria toxoid similar to the amounts in Vaxelis, are 
registered in multiple countries for use from infancy through 6 years of age. Two DTaP-IPV vaccines are 
registered in Europe for use through 12 years of age. Routine pharmacovigilance data provide reassurance of 
acceptable safety profiles when these vaccines are administered to children beyond 2 years of age.  
The CHMP found these considerations could be acceptable to extrapolate use of the vaccine in emergency 
catch-up vaccinations of older children (in accordance with official recommendations), but not sufficiently 
robust to identify a specific age cut off for an indication above 2 years of age. Hence based on the above the 
following indication was agreed: 
Section 4.1 
Vaxelis (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) is indicated for primary and booster vaccination in infants and toddlers from the 
age of 6 weeks against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and invasive diseases caused 
by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)up to the fifth birthday. 
The use of Vaxelis should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 131/140 
Lack of data above 15 months of age was described in sections 4.2 (based on the SmPC Guideline), 4.8 and 
5.1 for clarity to the prescribers. 
In section 4.4 and 4.5 the following warning on co-administration was included: 
Data from a clinical study indicate that, when Vaxelis is co-administered with pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV13), the rate of fever is higher following the booster dose in the second year of life compared to 
the primary series. Almost all fevers were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient (duration of ≤2 days). 
(See section 4.8). 
Likewise in section 4.8: 
In a clinical study where Vaxelis was administered concomitantly with Prevenar 13 (PCV13) as a booster dose 
of both vaccines, fever ≥38.0°C was reported in 54.3% of children, compared to 33.1% to 40.7% of children 
during the primary series. Fever ≥39.5°C was observed in 3.7% of children (post-booster) and 0.2% to 
0.8% of children (post-primary) receiving Vaxelis with PCV13 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Almost all fevers 
after primary and booster doses were mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient (duration of ≤2 days). 
Of note, the rates were not available for vaccine-related pyrexia on a per-dose basis within the study 
database. Therefore, the Applicant proposed to utilize the objective temperature data which means a change 
in method from showing the rates of vaccine-related pyrexia. The rates of fever are very similar regardless of 
method. 
In section 5.1 the following information was included to summarise some uncertainties related to the 
pertussis immune responses: 
Regarding PT and FIM, similar response rates and higher GMCs were observed both post-primary and 
post-booster in comparison to control vaccines. Lower FHA, PRN, IPV1 and IPV3 immune responses were 
observed after a 2-dose primary schedule (2-4 months), although the clinical relevance of these data remain 
uncertain. Pertussis response rates are similar to the control vaccine for all pertussis antigens after the 
booster dose. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: No full user 
consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a bridging 
report making reference to Hexyon. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
PR5I is a hexavalent paediatric combination vaccine for primary and booster immunization of infants and 
toddlers. It is designed to provide active immunization against diseases caused by Corynebacterium 
diphtheria, Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, Hib, and hepatitis B virus, i.e. 
to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B and invasive disease due to 
Haemophilus influenza type b. World-wide these diseases still causes significant morbidity and death, but in 
most developed countries, extensive immunization programs have made these diseases rare. The target 
populations are infants and toddlers from the age of 6 weeks. 
Clinical trial data available from 6 studies that randomised a total of 7557 participants demonstrated that 
PR5I is immunogenic and achieves a satisfactory immune response for all antigens in children at about one 
year of age, hence after completing both the primary vaccination -regardless of infant vaccination scheme 
(2-3-4, 2-4-6, 2-4 months) - and a booster vaccination in toddlers at 11 to 12 months. The non-inferiority 
criteria were met when PR5I post-booster seroresponse rates were compared with Infanrix hexa post-booster 
seroresponse rates.  
Available data also support the use of PR5I, exclusively in the infant vaccination series, with a combination of 
other licensed vaccines covering the same range of antigens for the booster dose in toddlers.  
When including studies conducted in the US, the clinical data covers the major ethnicities found within the EU, 
although these were not equally represented in the studied subjects.  
PR5I elicited more robust immune responses than the comparator vaccine with respect to the response rates 
to PRP antigen following the infant series at one month post-dose 2, or one month post-dose 3 indicating 
early protection against Hib.  
The pertussis data are similar across studies and vaccination schedules (2-dose, 3-dose). In general, PT 
GMTs are superior and PT response rates are similar to control, whereas FHA and PRN GMTs and response 
rates are weaker than control. Although the exact contribution of the individual pertussis antigens to 
protection is not clear, PT is considered to play a key role in establishing protection against clinical pertussis. 
The PT data are therefore reassuring. 
Limited available immunogenicity data (from 160 participants including the control arm) also support that 
PR5I can be administered to premature infants. 
Overall, the Phase III studies demonstrated that PR5I can be administered with rotavirus vaccines (i.e. 
RotaTeq and Rotarix), with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (i.e. Prevenar (7-valent) and Prevenar 13), 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/690012/2015 
Page 133/140 
with measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine (i.e. ProQuad), and with meningococcal type C vaccines 
(i.e. NeisVac-C or Menjugate), with little to no impact on the immunogenicity profile of PR5I or the licensed 
paediatric vaccines. However, the immune response to Rotarix antigens was lower -yet formally non-inferior- 
in the PR5I group compared to the Infanrix hexa group. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Vaccines of this type are licensed based on comparative data of immunogenicity and non-inferiority testing to 
known licensed vaccines. Protective antibody levels have been established for some (e.g. hepatitis B) but are 
lacking for others (e.g. pertussis). A theoretical uncertainty therefore remains that for such antigen, the 
measured antibody level might not be protective in real life, although this is unlikely.  
Lower FHA, PRN, IPV1 and IPV3 immune responses were observed after 2 doses of PR5I.  
The Applicant performed several post-hoc efficacy bridging analyses comparing the immunogenicity of PR5I 
with Daptacel based on the Sweden I Efficacy Trial, which showed 85.2% vaccine efficacy against pertussis. 
A similar vaccine efficacy is anticipated based on the PT data, but a lesser vaccine efficacy cannot be excluded 
based on the weaker FHA and PRN data. The clinical implications of this finding are currently not clear and 
complementing the primary vaccination scheme with the recommended booster dose in the second year of 
life is important, in particular because the period between primary and booster dose coincides with the period 
of clinical vulnerability for pertussis, i.e. in an infant’s first year of life, and in light of the current increase in 
pertussis disease in Europe. 
Uncertainty remains on whether the protection rates and persistence of protection are expected to be 
comparable to similar vaccines or combinations of vaccines. Following the booster dose at 12 months, PR5I 
is non-inferior compared to the control vaccines in terms of post-booster Hib responses indicative of 
long-term protection (anti-PRP ≥1.0 μg/mL); the response rates in the 2-dose and 3-dose schedule are 
slightly lower than the control but remain around 90% (90-95%). The clinical consequence of this is 
unknown. Although it is anticipated that the impact on clinical protection is likely to be minimal, if any, more 
rapid waning of immunity or a negative effect on carriage/transmission rates cannot be excluded. Monitoring 
of vaccine failure reports through routine post-marketing surveillance is anticipated to be sufficient to 
alleviate concerns regarding duration of protection of the Hib antigen in PR5I. 
The Applicant did not perform formal comparison of groups and thus could not conclude on the potential 
interference between administration of licensed pediatric vaccines such as PCV vaccine and PR5I.  
Concomitant use has been tested with a number of other licensed vaccines currently in use for infant routine 
immunisation in the EU (RotaTeq, Rotarix, ProQuad, and NeisVac-C and Menjugate). However, several 
countries may in the near future also include immunisation against Meningococcal group B in the routine 
vaccination program. Concomitant use of PR5I together with the meningococcal group B vaccine Bexsero 
may need to be addressed in future studies. There are no data with PR5I in immunosuppressed or 
immunocompromised infants, but vaccine failure will be monitored through post marketing surveillance.  
There are also no data with PR5I in children above the age of 15 months as PR5I has not been studied in this 
population. Although not explicitly studied in the PR5I clinical development program, the use of PR5I in 
children greater than 15 months of age (e.g. in catch up scenarios) is supported by clinical evidence of the 
immunogenicity of similar pertussis vaccines, however it is difficult to define a specific age cut off when 
appropriate booster vaccines should be considered. This limitation is reflected in the SmPC (sections 4.2 and 
5.1). 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

Page 134/140 
There are no data with PR5I in children born to mothers who received maternal antenatal booster 
immunisation with aP-containing vaccine. A number of European countries (including UK, Belgium, The 
Netherlands, and some regions of Spain) have introduced maternal TdaP vaccination during pregnancy to 
help prevent mortality in infants too young to be vaccinated (WHO Position paper on pertussis, August 2015). 
However, recent data from the UK (Ladhani et al., 2015) and Belgium (Maertens et al., personal 
communication) show subsequent blunting of pertussis antigen responses after the primary series.  
Data concerning the vaccine efficacy in malnutritioned or premature infants and in infants presenting chronic 
conditions are limited. While Phase III studies did not exclude premature infants, gestational age and weight 
were not collected and only descriptive immunogenicity information has been provided. Data available 
showed that the immune responses to PR5I in these infants were generally similar to those of the overall 
study population. However, a lower immune response may be observed and the level of clinical protection is 
unknown. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of PR5I is similar to the comparator vaccines or to the co-administration of a 
pentavalent and a monovalent HepB vaccine (Pentacel/RecombivaxHB) administered for primary series and 
booster vaccination in infants and toddlers. The overall safety profile is considered acceptable in the proposed 
indication. The most common ADRs for PR5I are decreased appetite, somnolence, vomiting, crying/irritability 
and injections sites reactions (erythema, pain, swelling). These ADR have been included in the SmPC with a 
frequency of >1/10 (very common).   
No major safety concern has been identified.  
Among the infant doses the first dose seems to give more injection site reactions, while the second dose gives 
the highest frequency of fever. The rate of solicited injection site reactions and fever are higher after the 
toddler dose than the infant doses.   
When PR5I was administered concomitantly with Prevenar 13 (PCV13) (booster dose), fever ≥38.0°C was 
reported in 54.3% of children, compared to 33.1% to 40.7% of children during the primary series. Fever ≥
39.5°C was observed in 3.7% of children (post-booster) and 0.2% to 0.8% of children (post-primary) 
receiving PR5I with PCV13 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Almost all fevers after primary and booster doses were 
mild or moderate (<39.5°C) and transient (duration of ≤2 days. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Although the sample size is sufficiently high for demonstrating uncommon adverse reactions, uncertainty 
remains about the incidence of very rare adverse events. An increase of rare syndromes cannot be ruled out 
with the presented database and good pharmacovigilance is therefore crucial.  
The indication is limited to infants and toddlers from the age of 6 weeks. There are no data on subjects above 
15 months. With respect to safety, the adverse event profile seen in infants receiving PR5I is generally similar 
to that observed with licensed vaccines such as PENTACEL (data from Protocols 005 and 006) and INFANRIX 
hexa (data from Protocols 007 and 008). The safety data generated from the clinical studies can be 
supportive for the use of PR5I in toddlers greater than 15 months of age, e.g. in the catch-up scenario.   
There is limited data in immunosuppressed and premature infants, and this has been reflected in the SmPC. 
  
  
 
 
  
Assessment report

Page 135/140 
The rate of fever after vaccination varies with study, study vaccines, vaccine dose, however the rate was 
equal for PR5I and comparator (EU studies). 
As both PR5I and Bexsero have components (OMPC) known to have a potential to induce fever, the additional 
potential risk of fever in the case the two vaccines are administered concomitantly was considered. Based on 
the data presented on other similar vaccine products, the OMPC component does not seem to induce more 
fever in concomitant vaccination. The CHMP therefore considers that at this stage, although there is no data 
for PR5I, there is no reason to expect higher fever rates if PR51 is given concomitantly to Bexsero vs. what 
is described for each individual product. 
The following important potential risks were identified: hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reactions; 
convulsions, including febrile convulsion; hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode; encephalopathy/Encephalitis; 
apnoea (in premature infants less than or equal to 28 weeks gestation); extensive limb swelling. 
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 hours should be considered 
when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤28 weeks of 
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit of 
vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The primary goal of a new vaccine is to induce antibody levels above an established threshold, should one 
exist. This goal has been reached for all antigens included in PR5I after the booster dose at the age of 12 
months in comparison to Infanrix hexa, and for PT and FIM, similar response rates and higher GMTs were 
observed both post-primary and post-booster in comparison to control vaccines containing these antigens. 
PR5I is the first hexavalent vaccine that contains the Hib PRP antigen conjugated to OMPC in a fully liquid 
formulation. This antigen demonstrates higher immune response rates after the primary series than the 
tetanus toxoid conjugated PRP antigen, but comparable or lower response rates after the booster dose. Lower 
FHA, PRN, IPV1 and IPV3 immune responses were observed after a 2-dose primary schedule (2-4 months), 
although the clinical relevance of these data remain uncertain. Pertussis response rates are similar to the 
control vaccine for all pertussis antigens after the booster dose. 
Overall, PR5I induced similar solicited adverse events vs. the Control.  Injection site erythema and swelling 
were significantly more frequent in the PR5I group than the control with a difference in the range of 3-6%.  
The frequency of fever was high when PR5I was given concomitantly with other vaccines. Based on daily 
temperature measures 73.4% of infants receiving PR5I (any dose) reported fever, while the number was 
70.3% for the comparator Infanrix hexa. The rate of serious adverse events specified as pyrexia, febrile 
convulsions and convulsions were low and this is reassuring. The slightly higher rate of fever after PR5I than 
control vaccine is thus considered to be of limited clinical relevance and clinically manageable. 
The high frequency of local and systemic reactions when PR5I is given concomitantly with other childhood 
vaccines might, however, have an impact on the acceptability of future new combinations with other 
vaccines. 
There are no other concerns regarding other unsolicited adverse events or serious adverse events and no 
deaths were considered to be related to the vaccination with PR5I. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The proposed formulation of Vaxelis has shown to elicit immune response above predefined thresholds of 
protection for each antigen, for which a correlate of protection exists, and non-inferior to the antigens in 
Infanrix hexa after the booster dose. The clinical data available from 6 studies that randomised a total of 7557 
participants showed that Vaxelis can be used for both primary and booster vaccination regardless of 
vaccination scheme (Infant vaccination series, 2-3-4, 2-4-6, 2-4 months) with a booster dose in toddlers at 
11 to 12 months. The issues concerning the lower antibody responses against FHA/PRN (pertussis) and 
anti-PRP (Hib) (the latter post toddler GMT) should be monitored in the routine pharmacovigilance, in 
particular regarding the 2-dose schedule.  
Regarding PR5I’s safety profile, the unfavourable effects observed in the clinical studies are comparable to 
those of the licensed comparators vaccines.  
Considering favourable and unfavourable effects based on the available non-clinical and clinical data 
presented for this submission, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Vaxelis in the prophylaxis of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis 
and invasive diseases caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), in infants and toddlers from the age of 
6 weeks, is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release  
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a state 
laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.
